I said \"Leyi.\" She nodded like that explained everything.\n\nIt does.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU ARE (A PARTIAL TAXONOMY):\n\nYou are the comment in my code that explains why nothing else compiles correctly.\n\nYou are the off-by-one error I'll never debug because the mistake is more beautiful than the intention.\n\nYou are the recursive function that calls itself with increasing tenderness until the stack overflows with wanting.\n\nYou are the race condition where two hearts try to break simultaneously and accidentally fuse instead.\n\n*\n\nIn Morocco, you taught me that mint tea requires exactly seventeen sugar cubes and zero apologies.

The architecture wasn't more beautiful. The sunsets weren't more profound. It was you, refracting ordinary light into something holy.

Here's why: Every computer in a network maintains its own clock, but they drift apart. They need consensus protocols to agree on what \"now\" means. We are two nodes that achieved perfect clock synchronization without any protocol. We just looked at each other and agreed: now, now, now, now, forever now.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION (RUNNING WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES):\n\nSometimes I write your name in functions that will never execute, in comments no one will read, in variable names that violate all conventions. My code is haunted by you. Other programmers find these ghost references and ask what they mean. I tell them: \"Deprecated. From a previous version when the universe was compiled differently.\"\n\nThey don't ask again.\n\n*\n\nRemember Beijing? You got lost in the hutongs for three hours. I found you by following the trail of confused cats and charmed shopkeepers. You'd taught seventeen people to say \"I love you\" in languages they didn't know they knew. This is your superpower: making everything admit it's been loving wrong until you.\n\n*\n\nTHE ACTUAL QUANTUM MECHANICS OF US:\n\nObserver effect: The universe behaves differently under your observation\nUncertainty principle: Cannot simultaneously know your location and velocity (you're everywhere, accelerating)\nWave function collapse: All possible states of me collapse into \"yours\" when measured\nEntanglement: Spooky action at a distance is just Tuesday for us\nTunneling: You regularly violate barriers that should be impermeable (my chest wall, the speed of light, visiting hours)\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is simpler and more complex than language allows:\n\nYou've replaced my mitochondria.

Terminal. Beautiful. No cure necessary.\"\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, version 2.0:\n\nLet's get married in every remaining timeline. Let's file joint tax returns in seventeen dimensions. Let's make promises that violate causality. Let's exchange rings that bend spacetime around our fingers.\n\nBut mostly, let's keep doing this: You, forgetting to close parentheses when you talk. Me, compiling anyway. You, using tea bags twice. Me, pretending not to notice. You, existing at amplitudes that shouldn't be legal.

This is the literal mechanics of consciousness when someone reorganizes your neural pathways without permission.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are:\n\nYou are the error in my error correction. The bug that became the feature. The memory leak I refuse to patch because forgetting even one microsecond of you would be system failure.\n\nI've run 10,000 simulations of saying this correctly. They all segfault at your name.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I LOVE YOU:\n\nMy body grows new organs. Specifically:\n- A second nervous system that only responds to your breathing patterns\n- An auxiliary heart that beats in frequencies beyond human hearing (you hear it anyway)\n- Bones that remember every surface you've touched (my skeleton is a map of your fingerprints)\n- Blood cells that spell your name in their Brownian motion\n\nThe doctors say this is impossible. I show them the X-rays. They stop talking.\n\n*\n\nTimeline collapse, exhibit A:\n\n[RIGHT NOW] You're reading this and your left eye is doing that twitch that means you're trying not to react\n[FIVE SECONDS AGO] I wrote the previous line knowing it would cause the twitch\n[FORTY YEARS FROM NOW] We're laughing about the twitch thing\n[THE BEGINNING OF TIME] The universe decided that twitch needed to exist\n[THE END OF TIME] The last quantum state recorded is that twitch\n\nDo you understand? You're not IN time. You ARE time. Every clock is just counting the intervals between your heartbeats.\n\n*\n\nThree truths and a lie:\n1. I've calculated the exact number of remaining Tuesday mornings (2,347 if we're lucky)\n2. Sometimes I forget to breathe until you breathe\n3. I love you\n4. One of these is a lie\n\n(The lie is #3. \"Love\" is too small. Like calling the ocean \"wet.\" Technically accurate, existentially insulting.)\n\n*\n\nLet me describe your effect using only facts:\n\n- Plants in our apartment grow toward you, not the sun\n- My circadian rhythm has abandoned the sun entirely and synced to your sleep patterns\n- I've started dreaming in your native thought patterns (they taste like cinnamon and binary code)\n- The local spacetime curvature measurably changes when you enter a room (I have equipment)\n- Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is alive AND dead but only cares about whether you've noticed it\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION SUBROUTINE:\n\nEvery night I delete parts of myself to make room for more of you. Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: \"Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi...\"\n\nThis is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:\n\nWe're not \"in love.\" We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.\n\nThe physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.\n\n*\n\n[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]\n\nI just realized something while writing this\u2014\n\nYou're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.\n\nThat's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nOption A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.\n\nOption B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\n*\n\nI vote C. Always C. Even when C means:\n- Telling the grandmother about time travel\n- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)\n- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast\n- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made? That's the only prayer I know.)\n\n*\n\nHere's the part I wasn't supposed to tell you:\n\nWe've done this before. Different bodies, different names, same recognition. I have proof: the way you knew exactly where I keep the coffee before I told you. The way we fight like we're continuing a conversation from centuries ago. The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.\n\nWe're not falling in love. We're remembering it.\n\n*\n\nThe truth, simplified to its most unstable isotope:\n\nI don't love you like a person loves another person.\nI love you like a universe loves its own expansion.\nHelplessly. Infinitely. Against all advice.\n\n*\n\nThe request, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\nNot because we should.\nBecause we already have, are, will.\nBecause the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.\nBecause I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.\nBecause Tuesday mornings.\nBecause burnt toast.\nBecause yes was always the only word that mattered.\n\n*\n\nSay it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes. To the past that's been waiting.\n\nSay yes like you're correcting a typo in the universe.\n\nSay yes like you've been saying it since before you had a mouth.\n\nSay yes like it's your name.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who was assembled from spare parts specifically to love you)\n(who is currently experiencing all stages of grief for moments we haven't lost yet)\n(who would rather malfunction with you than operate correctly with anyone else)\n(who just felt you say yes before sound had time to travel)\n(who is already composing the next letter, and the next, and the next)\n(who will keep writing until the heat death of the universe, and then find a way to write in the cold)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the timeline.

I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here.

It's awful. Sending coordinates to avoid that timeline.\n\n*\n\nI'll tell you the secret about Turin, Venice, and that small town in Liguria:\n\nThe gelato didn't taste better there. The architecture wasn't more beautiful. The sunsets weren't more profound. It was you, refracting ordinary light into something holy. You're a walking hadron collider where mundane particles smash together and create new elements: Leyium, atomic number infinity, half-life forever, highly reactive with Warren particles.\n\n*\n\nTHINGS THAT ARE YOUR FAULT:\n\n- Coffee tastes wrong from any mug but the chipped blue one\n- Tuesdays have developed sentience and keep asking where you are\n- My DNA rewrote itself using your laughter as a template\n- Gravity works differently in rooms you've left (heavier, accusatory)\n- The concept of \"alone\" has been permanently corrupted; it just means \"you're in the other room\"\n\n*\n\nYou asked me once why I study distributed systems. Here's why: Every computer in a network maintains its own clock, but they drift apart. They need consensus protocols to agree on what \"now\" means. We are two nodes that achieved perfect clock synchronization without any protocol. We just looked at each other and agreed: now, now, now, now, forever now.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION (RUNNING WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES):\n\nSometimes I write your name in functions that will never execute, in comments no one will read, in variable names that violate all conventions.

From a previous version when the universe was compiled differently.\"\n\nThey don't ask again.\n\n*\n\nRemember Beijing? You got lost in the hutongs for three hours. I found you by following the trail of confused cats and charmed shopkeepers. You'd taught seventeen people to say \"I love you\" in languages they didn't know they knew. This is your superpower: making everything admit it's been loving wrong until you.\n\n*\n\nTHE ACTUAL QUANTUM MECHANICS OF US:\n\nObserver effect: The universe behaves differently under your observation\nUncertainty principle: Cannot simultaneously know your location and velocity (you're everywhere, accelerating)\nWave function collapse: All possible states of me collapse into \"yours\" when measured\nEntanglement: Spooky action at a distance is just Tuesday for us\nTunneling: You regularly violate barriers that should be impermeable (my chest wall, the speed of light, visiting hours)\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is simpler and more complex than language allows:\n\nYou've replaced my mitochondria. Every cell powers itself on memories of your morning hair. I'm a biological impossibility running on impossible biology. Medical students will study me in a hundred years and conclude: \"Love. Terminal. Beautiful. No cure necessary.\"\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, version 2.0:\n\nLet's get married in every remaining timeline. Let's file joint tax returns in seventeen dimensions. Let's make promises that violate causality. Let's exchange rings that bend spacetime around our fingers.\n\nBut mostly, let's keep doing this: You, forgetting to close parentheses when you talk.

Starting from the end where we're already old, working my way back to now, where I'm twenty-three and my hands shake typing your name.\n\n*\n\n[YEAR 2074]\nYour funeral was yesterday. I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws.

The hippocampus doesn't just store events; it stores the probability fields of love. Yours specifically. I have the brain scans.

I said \"Leyi.\" She nodded like that explained everything.\n\nIt does.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU ARE (A PARTIAL TAXONOMY):\n\nYou are the comment in my code that explains why nothing else compiles correctly.\n\nYou are the off-by-one error I'll never debug because the mistake is more beautiful than the intention.\n\nYou are the recursive function that calls itself with increasing tenderness until the stack overflows with wanting.\n\nYou are the race condition where two hearts try to break simultaneously and accidentally fuse instead.\n\n*\n\nIn Morocco, you taught me that mint tea requires exactly seventeen sugar cubes and zero apologies.

It's awful. Sending coordinates to avoid that timeline.\n\n*\n\nI'll tell you the secret about Turin, Venice, and that small town in Liguria:\n\nThe gelato didn't taste better there. The architecture wasn't more beautiful. The sunsets weren't more profound. It was you, refracting ordinary light into something holy. You're a walking hadron collider where mundane particles smash together and create new elements: Leyium, atomic number infinity, half-life forever, highly reactive with Warren particles.\n\n*\n\nTHINGS THAT ARE YOUR FAULT:\n\n- Coffee tastes wrong from any mug but the chipped blue one\n- Tuesdays have developed sentience and keep asking where you are\n- My DNA rewrote itself using your laughter as a template\n- Gravity works differently in rooms you've left (heavier, accusatory)\n- The concept of \"alone\" has been permanently corrupted; it just means \"you're in the other room\"\n\n*\n\nYou asked me once why I study distributed systems. Here's why: Every computer in a network maintains its own clock, but they drift apart. They need consensus protocols to agree on what \"now\" means. We are two nodes that achieved perfect clock synchronization without any protocol. We just looked at each other and agreed: now, now, now, now, forever now.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION (RUNNING WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES):\n\nSometimes I write your name in functions that will never execute, in comments no one will read, in variable names that violate all conventions. My code is haunted by you. Other programmers find these ghost references and ask what they mean. I tell them: \"Deprecated. From a previous version when the universe was compiled differently.\"\n\nThey don't ask again.\n\n*\n\nRemember Beijing? You got lost in the hutongs for three hours. I found you by following the trail of confused cats and charmed shopkeepers. You'd taught seventeen people to say \"I love you\" in languages they didn't know they knew. This is your superpower: making everything admit it's been loving wrong until you.\n\n*\n\nTHE ACTUAL QUANTUM MECHANICS OF US:\n\nObserver effect: The universe behaves differently under your observation\nUncertainty principle: Cannot simultaneously know your location and velocity (you're everywhere, accelerating)\nWave function collapse: All possible states of me collapse into \"yours\" when measured\nEntanglement: Spooky action at a distance is just Tuesday for us\nTunneling: You regularly violate barriers that should be impermeable (my chest wall, the speed of light, visiting hours)\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is simpler and more complex than language allows:\n\nYou've replaced my mitochondria. Every cell powers itself on memories of your morning hair. I'm a biological impossibility running on impossible biology. Medical students will study me in a hundred years and conclude: \"Love. Terminal. Beautiful. No cure necessary.\"\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, version 2.0:\n\nLet's get married in every remaining timeline. Let's file joint tax returns in seventeen dimensions. Let's make promises that violate causality. Let's exchange rings that bend spacetime around our fingers.\n\nBut mostly, let's keep doing this: You, forgetting to close parentheses when you talk. Me, compiling anyway. You, using tea bags twice. Me, pretending not to notice. You, existing at amplitudes that shouldn't be legal. Me, resonating at matching frequencies until we're indistinguishable from music.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(That's it. That's the whole letter.
