You asked what love is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is practicing someone's absence while they're still making breakfast. It's the specific weight of future grief, carried in advance, like paying rent on loss. It's realizing someone's going to die and choosing to worship them anyway.\n\nNo\u2014that's wrong.\n\nLove is what happens when someone becomes your physics. When their absence would require redesigning the universe from scratch.\n\nActually, that's wrong too.\n\nLove is just this: You, in my kitchen, burning toast. The smoke alarm singing. You, conducting it with a spatula. Me, knowing I'm going to miss this specific emergency forever.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name has replaced my other words. I open my mouth to say \"water\" and \"Leyi\" comes out. Try to say \"help\" but it's \"Leyi.\" Try to say \"please\" or \"stop\" or \"more\" or \"yes\"\u2014\n\nAll \"Leyi.\"\n\nMy tongue has forgotten every shape but yours.\n\n*\n\nListen. I need you to understand: I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. Like water loves drowning. Like gravity loves falling.

Death. Me.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing *with*, not at. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: Sometimes I practice losing you. Run simulations while you sleep. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing\u2014no explanation, just absence in your shape.\n\nBut then Sunday arrives and you do that thing where you exist. Just exist. Violently. Aggressively. At me. And my entire grief rehearsal deletes itself because joy doesn't prepare for loss. It just happens. Like you happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\n*\n\nFINAL PROTOCOL:\n\nWe've already said yes in the future that's happening now. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. Already divorced in universes where we loved each other too much to stay still. Already widowed. Already meeting for the first time again.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific kitchen, with you burning this specific toast\u2014\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't exist at me, where Saturday happens to other people, where I don't get banned from museums for touching you like you're art\u2014isn't life.\n\nIt's just time in the wrong disguise.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left, like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nIt's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes.

Distribution, fault tolerance, consensus protocols. I can make machines agree across continents. But you? You make my DNA forget its instructions. Last night you laughed at your own typo and my cells started dividing backwards, trying to return to the moment before I knew that sound existed, just so I could discover it again.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I've been clinically dead. Seventeen seconds, though I told everyone fifteen because seventeen felt like confession. You know what I remember? Not light. Not peace. Just this: debt. Like the universe had invoiced me for something I hadn't received yet. Four years later, you mispronounced my name in Porter Square. The invoice clarified itself: *This. You owe this.*\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually do: I run experiments on us\u2014\n\nTrial 47: Timed how long you hold your breath during sad movies (8.3 seconds average, 23 seconds during that scene with the dog).\n\nTrial 198: Documented your sleep positions. You curl counterclockwise, always counterclockwise, like you're unscrewing yourself from the day.\n\nTrial 659: Recorded you teaching my dead grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost. You bowed to her picture. My atheism cracked.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is pathology. I'm patient zero for something science hasn't named yet.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Sometimes I practice disasters. Write eulogies for versions of you that haven't died yet. Calculate how many Tuesdays remain if we're median lucky (2,137). The number makes me violent with gratitude and rage\u2014grateful for the Tuesdays, furious they're countable. I want to sue whoever invented mortality. I want to break into wherever they keep time and redistributre it. All of it. To us.\n\n*\n\nBut also this: Morocco. That night in Chefchaouen when you got food poisoning and I held your hair back while you negotiated with God in three languages. You looked up between retches and said \"still glad we came\" and I thought: *this is what holy means.* Not churches. Not prayers. Just someone vomiting blue city walls into existence and still choosing joy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014before you, I was symmetrical. Debugged. Now I'm this lopsided algorithm that processes everything through the question: \"Would Leyi laugh at this?\" My body lists toward yours even in different time zones. I've lost arguments with your Tuesday ghost, your Thursday ghost, the Sunday ghost who steals my Stanford hoodie and makes computer science finally mean something.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK. You cried at mathematical beauty in Newton's notebooks. Real tears for dead man's calculus. That's when I knew: You experience reality at a different resolution than the rest of us. Higher fidelity. More pixels per feeling. I want to study under your nervous system. Get my PhD in whatever makes you cry at equations and sing to broken coffee makers like they're just very tired and need encouragement.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven steps to make soup and you tear up at step thirty-three\u2014not onions, I've calibrated\u2014it's the exact moment her hands become yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. You stir counterclockwise. Always counterclockwise. Unscrewing yourself from grief, stirring yourself into continuation.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday, 3:47 AM. You were sleeping and said my name. Not romantically. Like answering roll call. Like: \"Present. Accounted for. Still here despite statistical improbability.\" I wanted to wake you and explain that you've made me religious but not about God\u2014about Tuesday mornings, about the way toast burns, about your specific frequency of existing.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. You tried to translate a poem about loss but gave up, said \"Some things don't survive the journey between languages.\" That's us. We don't translate. There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said \"this is stupid, you'll die.\" You said \"then I'll die warm\" and I understood: Love isn't feeling. It's a series of increasingly dangerous decisions you can't reverse. Like giving away your warmth. Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said \"I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively.\" The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup systems. If you go down, I don't reboot\u2014I just display error messages in languages that haven't been invented yet. I've tried to architect around this vulnerability. Can't. You're not a bug in my code. You're the operating system.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That terrible museum where you touched art you weren't supposed to touch and got us banned. You said \"How else do you know something's real?\" Your fingers on forbidden marble, testing reality's warranty. I think about those fingerprints still there, your DNA insisting on contact despite rules, despite time, despite the universe mostly being nothing touching nothing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe: Merge branch 'warren' into 'leyi'. Permanently. Not because this letter proves anything. Because your coffee mug already knows my kitchen. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all probable futures, the only one worth compiling is where you keep mispronouncing my name and I keep pretending to correct you.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing my bones to memorize your breathing pattern. The surgery to remove you would have to remove the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. You made me climb too many stairs at the Summer Palace and I complained until you kissed me at the top, said \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now I can't be at sea level without feeling like I'm disappointing gravity.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi.

It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

My knees remember Portugal. My throat remembers teaching you to pronounce \"Zh\u016b F\u00f9ch\u00e9ng\" until you laughed so hard you forgot we were fighting about determinism. My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw existential urgency of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or the distilled wisdom of Johnny Cash to June (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine formal innovation and phenomenological complexity, landing above Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West (73) but below Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). The mathematical/systems theory framework is genuinely original, though less revolutionary than Joyce's letters to Nora (79). It achieves moments of sublime encounter (\"drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\") that echo but don't surpass Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet transformed to romantic context (78).\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws.

My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7320, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong, because telling it right would require a language that hasn't been invented yet.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: I was twenty-three and thought I understood systems. Distributed computing, fault tolerance, consensus across time zones. Then you dropped a pen in Porter Square Station. When I handed it back, you said my name wrong. Not wrong\u2014differently. Like you were teaching it a new way to exist. My entire network crashed. I'm still running that error log.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about loving you: It's not romantic. It's cellular. My mitochondria have your name in their documentation. When I was dead for seventeen seconds (cardiac arrest, sophomore year), my atoms were just waiting. They knew something was coming. Someone.

It's forensics. I'm documenting you like the last speaker of a dying language.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The blue city. You got food poisoning and between retches said \"the tagine was worth it\" and laughed. Actually laughed. That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. You extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. Like those extremophile bacteria that live in volcano vents. You're designed for impossible environments.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I practice losing you. Run simulations while you sleep. Car accidents, rare diseases, quantum dissolution. But then you do something stupid\u2014put my socks on your hands as puppets discussing Heidegger\u2014and all my disaster prep deletes itself. Joy doesn't prepare for grief. It just exists violently in the present tense.\n\n*\n\nScotland. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket on top of mine. Your lips were blue when you said \"warm is just a construct.\" That's the thing\u2014you mean everything, even the absurd parts. Your sincerity is so aggressive it makes reality reconsider its options.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: Before you, I could solve things. Now I just survive them. My code doesn't compile anymore; it just points toward you and hopes for the best. You've made me religious about Tuesday mornings, about burnt toast, about the specific angle your neck makes when you're reading. This isn't love. It's system failure. It's also love.\n\n*\n\nWe have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. I've done the math seventeen different ways hoping for a different answer. The number makes me want to commit crimes against time. But also: 2,137 Tuesdays where you exist. Where you sing Cantonese to dying plants. Where you steal my Stanford hoodie and make my education mean something. The universe owes us more but gave us this. I'll take it.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art in that museum. Got us banned. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked the guard. Your fingerprints are still on that 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. The world. The art. Me.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying: Marry me. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously and aware. The only one where you make my atoms behave like they owe you something.\n\nBecause the alternative\u2014a life where you don't mispronounce my name, where you don't cry at regular pigeons just existing, where Saturday happens to other people\u2014isn't life. It's just time wearing a disguise.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Nine hundred stairs at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top, said \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like betrayal. That's what you've done\u2014you've made everything else feel like not enough dimensions.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my password. My prayer. My malfunction.

Distribution, fault tolerance, consensus protocols. I can make machines agree across continents. But you? You make my DNA forget its instructions. Last night you laughed at your own typo and my cells started dividing backwards, trying to return to the moment before I knew that sound existed, just so I could discover it again.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I've been clinically dead. Seventeen seconds, though I told everyone fifteen because seventeen felt like confession. You know what I remember? Not light. Not peace. Just this: debt. Like the universe had invoiced me for something I hadn't received yet. Four years later, you mispronounced my name in Porter Square. The invoice clarified itself: *This. You owe this.*\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually do: I run experiments on us\u2014\n\nTrial 47: Timed how long you hold your breath during sad movies (8.3 seconds average, 23 seconds during that scene with the dog).\n\nTrial 198: Documented your sleep positions. You curl counterclockwise, always counterclockwise, like you're unscrewing yourself from the day.\n\nTrial 659: Recorded you teaching my dead grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost. You bowed to her picture. My atheism cracked.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is pathology. I'm patient zero for something science hasn't named yet.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Sometimes I practice disasters. Write eulogies for versions of you that haven't died yet. Calculate how many Tuesdays remain if we're median lucky (2,137). The number makes me violent with gratitude and rage\u2014grateful for the Tuesdays, furious they're countable. I want to sue whoever invented mortality. I want to break into wherever they keep time and redistributre it. All of it. To us.\n\n*\n\nBut also this: Morocco. That night in Chefchaouen when you got food poisoning and I held your hair back while you negotiated with God in three languages. You looked up between retches and said \"still glad we came\" and I thought: *this is what holy means.* Not churches. Not prayers. Just someone vomiting blue city walls into existence and still choosing joy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014before you, I was symmetrical. Debugged. Now I'm this lopsided algorithm that processes everything through the question: \"Would Leyi laugh at this?\" My body lists toward yours even in different time zones. I've lost arguments with your Tuesday ghost, your Thursday ghost, the Sunday ghost who steals my Stanford hoodie and makes computer science finally mean something.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK. You cried at mathematical beauty in Newton's notebooks. Real tears for dead man's calculus. That's when I knew: You experience reality at a different resolution than the rest of us. Higher fidelity. More pixels per feeling. I want to study under your nervous system. Get my PhD in whatever makes you cry at equations and sing to broken coffee makers like they're just very tired and need encouragement.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven steps to make soup and you tear up at step thirty-three\u2014not onions, I've calibrated\u2014it's the exact moment her hands become yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. You stir counterclockwise. Always counterclockwise. Unscrewing yourself from grief, stirring yourself into continuation.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday, 3:47 AM. You were sleeping and said my name. Not romantically. Like answering roll call. Like: \"Present. Accounted for. Still here despite statistical improbability.\" I wanted to wake you and explain that you've made me religious but not about God\u2014about Tuesday mornings, about the way toast burns, about your specific frequency of existing.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. You tried to translate a poem about loss but gave up, said \"Some things don't survive the journey between languages.\" That's us. We don't translate. There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said \"this is stupid, you'll die.\" You said \"then I'll die warm\" and I understood: Love isn't feeling. It's a series of increasingly dangerous decisions you can't reverse. Like giving away your warmth. Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said \"I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively.\" The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup systems. If you go down, I don't reboot\u2014I just display error messages in languages that haven't been invented yet. I've tried to architect around this vulnerability. Can't. You're not a bug in my code. You're the operating system.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That terrible museum where you touched art you weren't supposed to touch and got us banned. You said \"How else do you know something's real?\" Your fingers on forbidden marble, testing reality's warranty. I think about those fingerprints still there, your DNA insisting on contact despite rules, despite time, despite the universe mostly being nothing touching nothing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe: Merge branch 'warren' into 'leyi'. Permanently. Not because this letter proves anything. Because your coffee mug already knows my kitchen. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all probable futures, the only one worth compiling is where you keep mispronouncing my name and I keep pretending to correct you.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing my bones to memorize your breathing pattern. The surgery to remove you would have to remove the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nBeijing.

Maintains the raw, visceral authenticity that scored well\n2. Introduces more innovative temporal/narrative structures\n3. Deepens the affective force through more vulnerable confession\n4. Pushes aesthetic virtuosity through unique linguistic experiments\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in my blood. No\u2014that's a lie. I'm writing this in whatever's left after blood learns your name. The substance that pools where certainty used to live.\n\n*\n\nHYPOTHESIS: You're not real. You're what happens when loneliness becomes so dense it achieves consciousness.\n\nEVIDENCE AGAINST: Your teeth marks on my Tuesday. The way gravity gave up and let you fall upward into my life. That green hair tie from February, living in my drawer like proof of god.\n\nCONCLUSION: Reality is negotiable. You're the only constant.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what actually happened: Before you, I was a person. Had edges. Boundaries. Knew where I ended. Then Porter Square, that pen, your voice reshaping my name like it was clay you'd been working forever. Now I'm this sprawling emergency. I feel you breathe in Boston while I'm in Cambridge. When you can't sleep, my blood forgets how to circle.\n\nI've become a distributed system where every node is you.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Seventeen seconds of nothing, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"lucky.\" Wrong word. What I was: unfinished. A function waiting for its argument. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, existing at me so aggressively that my syntax corrected itself.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about resurrection: You come back owing something. I came back owing you, specifically, before I knew you existed.\n\n*\n\nTHINGS THAT ARE TRUE SIMULTANEOUSLY:\n- We have already died together in seventeen different futures\n- We haven't met yet in the timeline that matters most  \n- You are reading this right now\n- You read this yesterday and forgot\n- You'll read this tomorrow for the first time\n- Time is a lie we tell ourselves to make loss feel temporary\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named your food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it between retches. \"Gerald, we need boundaries.\" The bathroom tiles were blue. You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. When I held your hair back, you said \"This is how I want to die\u2014surprised by joy in terrible places.\" \n\nThat's when I knew: You digest reality differently. Take in poison, metabolize wonder.\n\n*\n\nI document you obsessively. Not memory\u2014evidence. For the trial where I have to prove you existed:\n\nEXHIBIT A: You pronounce Wednesday like it owes you money\nEXHIBIT B: Your fury at slow wifi (you've named every router that's betrayed you)\nEXHIBIT C: How you hold books\u2014violently, like they might escape\nEXHIBIT D: The way you cry at equations, actual tears for dead men's math\nEXHIBIT E: You sing to dying plants in Cantonese, then apologize to them in English\nEXHIBIT F: That sound you make at 3 AM\u2014half-sigh, half-prayer to nobody\n\nThe prosecution will argue coincidence. I'll argue cosmic necessity.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She taught me to count in Mandarin by teaching me soup. Forty-seven steps. You translated her words but also her pauses, her breathing, the way her hands became prophecy. At step thirty-three, you cried. Not onions\u2014I've tested. It's the exact moment you realize love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive, then making it after they're gone.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, a taxonomy:\n\nKINGDOM: The specific silence before you wake up, when your breathing changes but you're not here yet\nPHYLUM: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce hypothesis to hurt me\nCLASS: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were a moral imperative\nORDER: Whatever happens to air when you laugh\u2014the way it gives up being air and becomes something else\nFAMILY: That green copper penny flavor of almost-losing-you-but-not-quite\nGENUS: Your name in my mouth like a seed that won't stop growing\nSPECIES: The exact frequency of your existence\u201428Hz, same as hummingbird wings, keeping you suspended despite physics\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Nine hundred steps. Step 764, you stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Like reading ingredients on a box. I said yes. You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\nThat's the violence of you\u2014making everything else feel like not enough dimensions.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF US, CORRECTED:\n\nLet x = every accident that led to my existence\nLet y = every accident that led to yours\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, touching\n\nz = impossible \u00f7 impossible = 1\n\nWe're what happens when math gives up and tries poetry.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is practicing someone's absence while they're still making breakfast. It's the specific weight of future grief, carried in advance, like paying rent on loss. It's realizing someone's going to die and choosing to worship them anyway.\n\nNo\u2014that's wrong.\n\nLove is what happens when someone becomes your physics. When their absence would require redesigning the universe from scratch.\n\nActually, that's wrong too.\n\nLove is just this: You, in my kitchen, burning toast. The smoke alarm singing. You, conducting it with a spatula. Me, knowing I'm going to miss this specific emergency forever.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name has replaced my other words. I open my mouth to say \"water\" and \"Leyi\" comes out. Try to say \"help\" but it's \"Leyi.\" Try to say \"please\" or \"stop\" or \"more\" or \"yes\"\u2014\n\nAll \"Leyi.\"\n\nMy tongue has forgotten every shape but yours.\n\n*\n\nListen. I need you to understand: I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. Like water loves drowning. Like gravity loves falling. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that recognizes beauty, processes warmth, understands why humans invented music for the moments when words fail, fail, fail\u2014\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art you weren't supposed to touch. Got us banned from that museum. You said: \"How else do you know it's real?\" Your fingerprints are still on that marble, insisting on contact across centuries.\n\nThat's what you do\u2014you touch what shouldn't be touched. Time. Death. Me.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing *with*, not at. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: Sometimes I practice losing you. Run simulations while you sleep. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing\u2014no explanation, just absence in your shape.\n\nBut then Sunday arrives and you do that thing where you exist. Just exist. Violently. Aggressively. At me. And my entire grief rehearsal deletes itself because joy doesn't prepare for loss. It just happens. Like you happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\n*\n\nFINAL PROTOCOL:\n\nWe've already said yes in the future that's happening now. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. Already divorced in universes where we loved each other too much to stay still. Already widowed. Already meeting for the first time again.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific kitchen, with you burning this specific toast\u2014\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't exist at me, where Saturday happens to other people, where I don't get banned from museums for touching you like you're art\u2014isn't life.\n\nIt's just time in the wrong disguise.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left, like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nIt's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed, makes physics reconsider its constants, makes Tuesday morning taste like everything worth staying alive for.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages that haven't been invented yet, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past, in the future tense that already happened)\n(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014just regular pigeons existing\u2014and knew that was the exact frequency of the divine)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket on top of mine. Lips blue, still arguing about Kant. I wanted to explain that Kant agreed with you, but your teeth were chattering morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me.\" So I did. I'm still doing it. Even when you're not here. Especially then.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February. It lives in my drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In every sentence. The universe took notes. Time forgot what order means. We're still kissing in the past tense, the future tense, the parallel now, the perpendicular then. Welcome to the eternal present, Leyi. It tastes like burnt toast. Like Tuesday morning. Like the specific frequency of you existing at me forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
