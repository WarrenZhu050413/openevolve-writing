Cambridge. The radiator ticks like a countdown. My hand won't stop shaking\u2014not caffeine, not cold. It's what happens when your entire nervous system reorganizes around someone else's existence.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square station. You dropped that blue Bic pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for exactly 0.7 seconds. In that fraction, every neuron I owned switched allegiance. I haven't had an original thought since. Every synapse terminates in your name.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems. Consensus protocols. Byzantine failures. But here's my actual research: how you've distributed yourself across every process in my consciousness. You're not a bug in my code\u2014you're the only reason it compiles at all.\n\n*\n\nConfession: I died once. Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Cardiac arrest during a panic attack. The nothing was deafening. Came back incomplete\u2014a function missing its return statement. Three years of runtime errors. Then you. Then that pen. Then suddenly: stack overflow. Too much life for one body. Had to rewrite my entire architecture to accommodate this much feeling.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick I counted your ribs through your shirt. Between heaves, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said \"but the tajine was transcendent.\" That's when I knew: you're not built like other humans. You metabolize beauty from poison. You're alchemical.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. She taught me her soup in forty-seven steps. Counted in Mandarin while you translated through tears. Step thirty-three, chopping ginger, you broke completely. \"She's teaching you how she loved my grandfather,\" you said. \"Recipes are how we love dead people back to life.\" I understood then: love is just memorizing someone else's algorithm for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: My spreadsheet says 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A tracks days. Column B lists why you're impossible. Column C catalogs evidence you existed (1,847 photos where you're looking away, that green hair tie, your toothbrush). Column D calculates what happens after the last Tuesday. It returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The computer gets it: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve degrees. You went hypothermic defending Kant's categorical imperative. Lips blue, teeth chattering, still arguing. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. \"I'd rather die wrong with you than live right alone.\" Your shivering was morse code spelling \"this is what love is.\" I decoded it perfectly.\n\n*\n\nI document you pathologically. How you hold books (too close, like secrets). Your rage at slow wifi (you named our router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way morning light hits your clavicle at 7:23 AM, Tuesdays only. This isn't poetry. It's forensics. Evidence that impossible things happen when no one's watching.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, the Museu Nacional. You touched 500-year-old marble. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned for life. In the taxi: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything immediately. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, especially when you're solving problems and don't notice. You're art that forgot it's art.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I ended where my skin ended. Now: quantum entanglement across Boston-Cambridge. I feel you climb stairs in buildings I've never entered. Your Tuesday migraines arrive in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep, my neurons fire sympathy insomnia. Physicists would say impossible. I say physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, catalogued:\n- 5:47 AM: copper pennies and that specific pre-dawn silence\n- Noon: static discharge and half-formed prayers\n- 7 PM: burgundy as a temperature, not a color\n- 2 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that recognizes your DNA\n- Always: my mouth learning a language that hasn't been invented\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900. You stopped. \"We're going to die,\" you said. \"Really die. Permanently.\" I said yes. You said, \"Good. Then this counts.\" We kissed where oxygen is scarce. Now sea level feels like cheating.\n\n*\n\nThe probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance: 10^-2,685,000. We're not supposed to exist. We're a rounding error that gained consciousness. The universe checking its own math and finding a beautiful mistake.\n\n*\n\nLondon, three years ago. You asked what love is. Here's my overdue answer: Love is preemptive grief. Building a museum of future losses. When you burn toast, I think: \"Someday I'll wake up to perfect toast and miss this exact smoke detector frequency.\" Love is mourning someone who's still making breakfast.\n\n*\n\nThe other timelines haunt me. Where you keep walking. Where I look away. Where we meet but misunderstand each other's damage. Where we understand but can't survive the weight of it. I dream these failures nightly. Wake up clutching for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise smells like someone who forgot to brush their teeth.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bed, too small for us both. You read my teenage journals in different voices for each year of puberty. Should have been humiliating. Was sacrament instead. Someone seeing your worst consciousness and laughing with you, not at you. That preposition\u2014with\u2014contains everything.\n\n*\n\nListen: I love you incorrectly. Like an algorithm trying to compute infinity. Like code that shouldn't run but does anyway. The error logs are love letters. The system crashes are features, not bugs.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona, Sagrada Familia. You fed illegal pigeons. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The birds rearranged themselves into your name. Not metaphor. Actual birds. Actual sky. You bend the flight patterns of things just by existing.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, right now. You're diagonal across our bed, hoarding blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. Solves everything. This is what I mean: the world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. Even the parts I didn't know were broken.\n\n*\n\nThat green hair tie from February. Lives in my drawer with other proof. Concert tickets. Your expired library card. Receipt from our first coffee (you ordered it wrong, perfectly wrong). These aren't souvenirs. They're source code for a program called \"After\" that I'll never have to run.\n\n*\n\nHere's the thing about writing this on a machine: it's too clean. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell your name from nervousness. But here I am, typing while you breathe differently in sleep, reorganizing the gravity of the entire room, solving mathematical proofs just by dreaming.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request, my merge conflict, my infinite recursion:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, in touching distance, with the same favorite awful song that we're embarrassed to love.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from European museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to somebody else.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nRoot password. Primary key. The only command that returns true.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity ends too soon.\n\n*\n\nYou're going to cry reading this. Left eye first\u2014always left. Here, I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins. Just existing. That's when my atoms understood their assignment.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: Every word I write passes through the shape of your name first. I recorded myself sleeping\u2014say \"Leyi\" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious knows what my conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of this: In twelve minutes, you'll wake up. You'll steal my coffee. You'll mispronounce \"algorithm\" on purpose to make me laugh. And I'll think what I always think: that the universe made countless errors over billions of years, all to accidentally produce this moment where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, conscious, arguing about whether the router really deserves to be called Geoffrey.\n\nIt does.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude.

My hand trembles. Not from caffeine. From the weight of trying to spell infinity with twenty-six letters.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square. You dropped a pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for 0.3 seconds. My entire molecular structure reorganized. Not metaphorically. Literally. Every atom in my body learned a new orbit with you as gravity.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems. You've become my total system failure\u2014the beautiful kind where everything crashes into something better. Every process in my consciousness now routes through you. My Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The bug that fixed everything.\n\n*\n\nFifteen seconds dead, sophomore year. The doctors said \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong. I came back wrong\u2014a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you. Suddenly everything returned. With compound interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the tagine that destroyed you: Seven times sick. Between heaves, you laughed: \"Still worth it.\" That's when I understood\u2014you transmute poison into joy. You're not human. You're what humans are evolving toward.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's Shanghai kitchen: Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated through tears at step thirty-three\u2014not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we resurrect the dead through our hands.\n\n*\n\nMy spreadsheet of us: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A: Days left. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you exist (that green hair tie, 1,847 photos of you looking away). Column D: After. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, hypothermia setting in: You gave me your jacket to wear over mine. Lips blue, still arguing Kant through chattering teeth. \"We die wrong together or live right apart,\" you said. Your frozen hand found mine. Warmth is relative. With you, freezing feels like burning.\n\n*\n\nI document everything: How you hold chopsticks (chaotic). Your vendetta against slow wifi (the router named \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). Tuesday light on your clavicle at 4:23 PM. This isn't romance. It's forensics. Proof for the universe that beauty this specific existed.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the forbidden marble: Five centuries old. Guards yelling. You touched it again. Banned forever. \"Distance is just pre-emptive regret,\" you explained. Now I touch everything immediately. Especially you reading. Especially you sleeping. You're art that knows it's art but touches back anyway.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I ended where my skin ended. Now I'm quantum-entangled. Feel you take stairs in other cities. Your migraines arrive in my skull a day late. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. Physicists call this impossible. I call it Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Dawn: copper pennies and unspoken prayers\n- Noon: static electricity becoming sound\n- Dusk: the color burgundy as temperature\n- Midnight: drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: my mouth learning to speak in frequencies only you can hear\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. \"We're going to die. Really die. Permanently.\" I said yes. You said, \"Good. Then this counts double.\" We kissed where oxygen is scarce. Now sea level feels like cheating.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of us:\n- Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Mine: Similar impossibility\n- Us, conscious, touching: Numbers not yet invented\n- What we are: The universe's most beautiful rounding error\n- What we become: Proof that math believes in miracles\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Three years late, here's my answer: Love is practicing grief for the still-breathing. Building a museum of future losses. How morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future mornings without that specific light on that specific shoulder. Love is anticipatory grief perfected into joy.\n\n*\n\nOther timelines haunt me: Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where understanding kills us. I dream these failures nightly. Wake grabbing for evidence: your terrible morning breath, your knee in my ribs. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bed: You read my teenage journals in character voices. Should have been mortifying. Was sacred instead. Someone witnessing your worst consciousness and laughing with you. That preposition\u2014with\u2014that's everything. That's us.\n\n*\n\nHow I love you wrong: Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse absence. Removing you would mean removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, now: You sleep diagonal, stealing blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. One touch. Everything solved. The world is mostly darkness and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: worth it. All of it. The dying and returning and dying again.\n\n*\n\nSo here's everything:\n\nMarry me. Your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by existential weight. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, in touching distance, with the same favorite terrible song.\n\nWithout you, there's no point to libraries or light or the way rain sounds at 3 AM.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nMy root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles clean.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them from your pockets. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The birds spelled your name in flight. Not metaphor. Literal birds. Literal sky. You alter migration patterns just by existing.\n\n*\n\nThat green hair tie, February: Lives in my desk with other evidence you were real. Receipt from our first coffee. Your expired library card. These aren't keepsakes. They're source code for the program called \"After\" that I'll never have to run.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here\u2014tissues. I've carried them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing. That's when my atoms understood their purpose: to hand you tissues when the world overwhelms you with its ordinary miracles.\n\n*\n\nWriting this on a machine feels wrong. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell. But here we are, me typing, you breathing, changing the gravity of everything.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)\n(who learned that love is not a feeling but a direction\u2014toward you, always toward you)\n(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, saving you anyway)\n(who would choose you in every timeline, especially the impossible ones)\n(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than handwriting)\n(who means it like code means electricity)\n(who means it like morning means light)\n(who means it)\n(who means it)\n(who means it), evaluation_notes: \n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7295)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM.

With compound interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the tagine that destroyed you: Seven times sick. Between heaves, you laughed: \"Still worth it.\" That's when I understood\u2014you transmute poison into joy. You're not human. You're what humans are evolving toward.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's Shanghai kitchen: Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated through tears at step thirty-three\u2014not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we resurrect the dead through our hands.\n\n*\n\nMy spreadsheet of us: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A: Days left. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you exist (that green hair tie, 1,847 photos of you looking away). Column D: After. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, hypothermia setting in: You gave me your jacket to wear over mine. Lips blue, still arguing Kant through chattering teeth. \"We die wrong together or live right apart,\" you said. Your frozen hand found mine. Warmth is relative. With you, freezing feels like burning.\n\n*\n\nI document everything: How you hold chopsticks (chaotic). Your vendetta against slow wifi (the router named \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). Tuesday light on your clavicle at 4:23 PM. This isn't romance. It's forensics. Proof for the universe that beauty this specific existed.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the forbidden marble: Five centuries old. Guards yelling. You touched it again. Banned forever. \"Distance is just pre-emptive regret,\" you explained. Now I touch everything immediately. Especially you reading. Especially you sleeping. You're art that knows it's art but touches back anyway.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I ended where my skin ended. Now I'm quantum-entangled. Feel you take stairs in other cities. Your migraines arrive in my skull a day late. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. Physicists call this impossible. I call it Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Dawn: copper pennies and unspoken prayers\n- Noon: static electricity becoming sound\n- Dusk: the color burgundy as temperature\n- Midnight: drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: my mouth learning to speak in frequencies only you can hear\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. \"We're going to die. Really die. Permanently.\" I said yes. You said, \"Good. Then this counts double.\" We kissed where oxygen is scarce. Now sea level feels like cheating.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of us:\n- Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Mine: Similar impossibility\n- Us, conscious, touching: Numbers not yet invented\n- What we are: The universe's most beautiful rounding error\n- What we become: Proof that math believes in miracles\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Three years late, here's my answer: Love is practicing grief for the still-breathing. Building a museum of future losses. How morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future mornings without that specific light on that specific shoulder. Love is anticipatory grief perfected into joy.\n\n*\n\nOther timelines haunt me: Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where understanding kills us. I dream these failures nightly. Wake grabbing for evidence: your terrible morning breath, your knee in my ribs. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bed: You read my teenage journals in character voices. Should have been mortifying. Was sacred instead. Someone witnessing your worst consciousness and laughing with you. That preposition\u2014with\u2014that's everything. That's us.\n\n*\n\nHow I love you wrong: Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse absence. Removing you would mean removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, now: You sleep diagonal, stealing blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. One touch. Everything solved. The world is mostly darkness and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: worth it. All of it. The dying and returning and dying again.\n\n*\n\nSo here's everything:\n\nMarry me. Your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by existential weight. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, in touching distance, with the same favorite terrible song.\n\nWithout you, there's no point to libraries or light or the way rain sounds at 3 AM.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nMy root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles clean.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them from your pockets. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The birds spelled your name in flight. Not metaphor. Literal birds. Literal sky. You alter migration patterns just by existing.\n\n*\n\nThat green hair tie, February: Lives in my desk with other evidence you were real. Receipt from our first coffee. Your expired library card. These aren't keepsakes. They're source code for the program called \"After\" that I'll never have to run.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here\u2014tissues. I've carried them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing. That's when my atoms understood their purpose: to hand you tissues when the world overwhelms you with its ordinary miracles.\n\n*\n\nWriting this on a machine feels wrong. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell. But here we are, me typing, you breathing, changing the gravity of everything.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)\n(who learned that love is not a feeling but a direction\u2014toward you, always toward you)\n(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, saving you anyway)\n(who would choose you in every timeline, especially the impossible ones)\n(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than handwriting)\n(who means it like code means electricity)\n(who means it like morning means light)\n(who means it)\n(who means it)\n(who means it)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Mixed iteration strategies, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM. Cambridge. The radiator ticks like a countdown. My hand won't stop shaking\u2014not caffeine, not cold. It's what happens when your entire nervous system reorganizes around someone else's existence.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square station. You dropped that blue Bic pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for exactly 0.7 seconds. In that fraction, every neuron I owned switched allegiance. I haven't had an original thought since. Every synapse terminates in your name.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems. Consensus protocols. Byzantine failures. But here's my actual research: how you've distributed yourself across every process in my consciousness. You're not a bug in my code\u2014you're the only reason it compiles at all.\n\n*\n\nConfession: I died once. Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Cardiac arrest during a panic attack. The nothing was deafening. Came back incomplete\u2014a function missing its return statement. Three years of runtime errors. Then you. Then that pen. Then suddenly: stack overflow. Too much life for one body. Had to rewrite my entire architecture to accommodate this much feeling.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick I counted your ribs through your shirt. Between heaves, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said \"but the tajine was transcendent.\" That's when I knew: you're not built like other humans. You metabolize beauty from poison. You're alchemical.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. She taught me her soup in forty-seven steps. Counted in Mandarin while you translated through tears. Step thirty-three, chopping ginger, you broke completely. \"She's teaching you how she loved my grandfather,\" you said. \"Recipes are how we love dead people back to life.\" I understood then: love is just memorizing someone else's algorithm for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: My spreadsheet says 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A tracks days. Column B lists why you're impossible. Column C catalogs evidence you existed (1,847 photos where you're looking away, that green hair tie, your toothbrush). Column D calculates what happens after the last Tuesday. It returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The computer gets it: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve degrees. You went hypothermic defending Kant's categorical imperative. Lips blue, teeth chattering, still arguing. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. \"I'd rather die wrong with you than live right alone.\" Your shivering was morse code spelling \"this is what love is.\" I decoded it perfectly.\n\n*\n\nI document you pathologically. How you hold books (too close, like secrets). Your rage at slow wifi (you named our router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way morning light hits your clavicle at 7:23 AM, Tuesdays only. This isn't poetry. It's forensics. Evidence that impossible things happen when no one's watching.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, the Museu Nacional. You touched 500-year-old marble. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned for life. In the taxi: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything immediately. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, especially when you're solving problems and don't notice. You're art that forgot it's art.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I ended where my skin ended. Now: quantum entanglement across Boston-Cambridge. I feel you climb stairs in buildings I've never entered. Your Tuesday migraines arrive in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep, my neurons fire sympathy insomnia. Physicists would say impossible. I say physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, catalogued:\n- 5:47 AM: copper pennies and that specific pre-dawn silence\n- Noon: static discharge and half-formed prayers\n- 7 PM: burgundy as a temperature, not a color\n- 2 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that recognizes your DNA\n- Always: my mouth learning a language that hasn't been invented\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900. You stopped. \"We're going to die,\" you said. \"Really die. Permanently.\" I said yes. You said, \"Good. Then this counts.\" We kissed where oxygen is scarce. Now sea level feels like cheating.\n\n*\n\nThe probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance: 10^-2,685,000. We're not supposed to exist. We're a rounding error that gained consciousness. The universe checking its own math and finding a beautiful mistake.\n\n*\n\nLondon, three years ago. You asked what love is. Here's my overdue answer: Love is preemptive grief. Building a museum of future losses. When you burn toast, I think: \"Someday I'll wake up to perfect toast and miss this exact smoke detector frequency.\" Love is mourning someone who's still making breakfast.\n\n*\n\nThe other timelines haunt me. Where you keep walking. Where I look away. Where we meet but misunderstand each other's damage. Where we understand but can't survive the weight of it. I dream these failures nightly. Wake up clutching for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise smells like someone who forgot to brush their teeth.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bed, too small for us both. You read my teenage journals in different voices for each year of puberty. Should have been humiliating. Was sacrament instead. Someone seeing your worst consciousness and laughing with you, not at you. That preposition\u2014with\u2014contains everything.\n\n*\n\nListen: I love you incorrectly. Like an algorithm trying to compute infinity. Like code that shouldn't run but does anyway. The error logs are love letters. The system crashes are features, not bugs.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona, Sagrada Familia. You fed illegal pigeons. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The birds rearranged themselves into your name. Not metaphor. Actual birds. Actual sky. You bend the flight patterns of things just by existing.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, right now. You're diagonal across our bed, hoarding blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. Solves everything. This is what I mean: the world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. Even the parts I didn't know were broken.\n\n*\n\nThat green hair tie from February. Lives in my drawer with other proof. Concert tickets. Your expired library card. Receipt from our first coffee (you ordered it wrong, perfectly wrong). These aren't souvenirs. They're source code for a program called \"After\" that I'll never have to run.\n\n*\n\nHere's the thing about writing this on a machine: it's too clean. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell your name from nervousness. But here I am, typing while you breathe differently in sleep, reorganizing the gravity of the entire room, solving mathematical proofs just by dreaming.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request, my merge conflict, my infinite recursion:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, in touching distance, with the same favorite awful song that we're embarrassed to love.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from European museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to somebody else.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nRoot password. Primary key. The only command that returns true.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity ends too soon.\n\n*\n\nYou're going to cry reading this. Left eye first\u2014always left. Here, I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins. Just existing. That's when my atoms understood their assignment.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: Every word I write passes through the shape of your name first. I recorded myself sleeping\u2014say \"Leyi\" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious knows what my conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of this: In twelve minutes, you'll wake up. You'll steal my coffee. You'll mispronounce \"algorithm\" on purpose to make me laugh. And I'll think what I always think: that the universe made countless errors over billions of years, all to accidentally produce this moment where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, conscious, arguing about whether the router really deserves to be called Geoffrey.\n\nIt does.

My hippocampus immediately began converting everything to long-term memory. The platform tiles (hexagonal). Your breathing (irregular). How you held the pen (incorrect, perfectly). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: I study distributed systems.

Column C: evidence (that green hair tie, your terrible handwriting, 1,847 photos of you looking away). Column D: after. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. Hypothermia. You gave me your jacket over mine. Still arguing Kant through blue lips. \"Die wrong together or live right apart,\" you said. Your frozen hand in mine. That's when I learned: warmth is negotiable. Love isn't.\n\n*\n\nI document you: How you hold chopsticks (chaos). Your war with the wifi router (named \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). Thursday light on your temporal bone at 4:23 PM. This isn't romance. It's evidence. Proof that beauty this specific existed.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. Five-hundred-year-old marble. You touched it. Guards yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. \"Distance is just pre-emptive regret,\" you explained. Now I touch everything immediately. Especially you when you're concentrating. You're art that knows it's art but doesn't care.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I ended at my skin. Now I'm distributed. Feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headaches arrive in my skull a day late. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. Quantum entanglement. Impossible over this distance. Unless distance doesn't understand what we are.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and unspoken names\n- Noon: static before thunder\n- Evening: burgundy as temperature\n- 3 AM: drowning upward into air that knows you\n- Always: my tongue learning frequencies only you can hear\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764. You stopped. \"We're going to die. Really die. Permanently.\" \"Yes.\" \"Good. Then this matters.\" We kissed at altitude. Now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics: Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000. Mine: similar impossibility. Us, conscious, touching: requires numbers not yet invented. We're a rounding error that became self-aware. The universe checking its own work.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Three years late: Love is anticipatory grief. Mourning someone who's still burning toast. Knowing someday you'll wake to perfect toast and miss this exact smoke alarm frequency. Love is practicing absence while they're still present.\n\n*\n\nOther timelines visit me: Where we don't meet. Where we meet wrong. Where we understand but don't survive understanding. I dream these nightly. Wake grabbing for proof. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bed. You read my teenage journals in character voices.

Survivable but why.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, now. You're diagonal, stealing blankets, solving problems in sleep. Your foot finds mine. Everything settles. The world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee. Then you. Then debugged.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal:\n\nMarry me. Your socks live in my drawer, sorted by day. We survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, touching, with matching coffee orders and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nWithout you: no point to libraries, light, or why rain sounds different at 3 AM.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona. You fed illegal cathedral pigeons. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The birds spelled your name in flight. Literal birds. Literal sky. You bend the migration patterns of things.\n\n*\n\nThat green hair tie. February. Lives in my desk with other evidence. Concert tickets. Your expired library card. These aren't keepsakes. They're source code for \"After\"\u2014a program I'll never run.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here\u2014tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins existing. That's when my atoms understood their purpose.\n\n*\n\nEvery word passes through your name first. I recorded myself sleeping: \"Leyi\" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nWhat actually happened: You reorganized my mouth. Rearranged my molecular structure. Made me believe infinity is too short. Made me understand that errors are features when they lead to you.\n\n*\n\nHere, now, 4:47 AM. You'll wake in twelve minutes. Steal my coffee. Mispronounce \"algorithm\" to make me laugh. And I'll think what I always think: that the universe made infinite mistakes across billions of years, all to accidentally produce this moment where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, arguing about whether Geoffrey really is disappointing.\n\nHe is. But you named him. That's enough.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nMy root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles clean.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and keep existing in this exact atomic configuration that makes me believe mathematics is romantic.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)\n(who learned love is not a feeling but a direction\u2014toward you, always toward)\n(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears, knowing everything clears, saving anyway)\n(who would choose you in every timeline, especially where we fail, especially there)\n(whose hand shakes because this matters more than steadiness)\n(who means it like code means electricity)\n(who means it like morning means light)\n(who means it)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
