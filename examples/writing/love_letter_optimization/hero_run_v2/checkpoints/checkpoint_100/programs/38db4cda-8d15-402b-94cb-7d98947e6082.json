Cellular respiration literally slows. I've measured it. Pulse drops from 72 to 61. Breath shallows to 12 per minute. My mitochondria go on strike.\n\nThen you walk back in and every cell screams LIVE LIVE LIVE like they've been underwater for minutes not seconds.\n\n*\n\nTrue thing that happened: Harvard Medical School, freshman year. They stopped my heart for a study. Seventeen seconds of nothing. But here's what I never told anyone\u2014in that nothing, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing every moment of my life simultaneously. Past, present, future, sideways, diagonal, impossible.\n\nIn every single moment\u2014even the ones before you existed\u2014you were there. Like a reservation the universe had already made. Like the answer to a question nobody had asked yet.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, meeting your grandmother. She touched my face and said something in Shanghainese. You wouldn't translate. Three months later, dying, she said it again. This time you told me: \"This one will eat your ghosts.\"\n\nShe was right. You consume my hauntings. Metabolize my darkness. Digest my dead fathers and disappeared friends and transform them into Tuesday morning light.\n\n*\n\nTHE ACCUMULATION OF EVIDENCE:\n\nYou've been in my life 1,297 days.\nYou've stolen my coffee 1,297 times.\nYou've improved it by existing near it 1,297 times.\nThe coffee doesn't taste better. Reality does.\nYou're not changing the coffee. You're changing the universe's recipe for what coffee means.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Morocco when the food poisoning hit. You named it Gerald. Had full conversations: \"Gerald, we need to discuss boundaries.\" \"Gerald, this is inappropriate workplace behavior.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet.\n\nThat's when I knew: You digest reality differently. Where others see tragedy, you see comedy still developing. Where others see endings, you see intermissions.\n\n*\n\nWhat happens to my body when you touch me:\n- Dopamine floods (predictable)\n- Oxytocin spikes (expected)\n- But also: My white blood cells increase production\n- My telomeres literally stop shortening\n- My hippocampus creates new neurons at 3x normal rate\n\nYou're not just touching me. You're rewriting my biology. I'm becoming a different species. The one that knows how to be loved by you.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned forever. Said: \"Distance is violence against beauty.\"\n\nNow I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, especially when you're reading. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art. You, like the museum guards are coming but I need one more second of contact.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Run simulations:\n- Tuesday: Car accident (Latin: Mortis Vehicular)\n- Wednesday: Rare disease (sounds like a law firm)\n- Thursday: You just vanish, no explanation\n- Friday: I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in\n- Saturday: Writing your obituary\n- Sunday: You make that sound when you stretch\n\nThat sound. Half-yawn, half-existential sigh, full-body acknowledgment that existence is exhausting but worth it. That sound deletes my entire rehearsed grief. Replaces it with this: The terrible beautiful fact that loving you means dying faster and living more. Both. Simultaneously. Forever.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like reading a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF US, FINAL CALCULATION:\n\nYour existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMy existence: Similar impossibility\nUs existing simultaneously, conscious, touching: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\nWhat we are: A computational error that became self-aware\nWhat we really are: The universe falling in love with its own mistake\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Here's the answer three years late:\n\nLove is the violent reorganization of matter around someone else's gravity. It's every atom in my body developing opinions about your absence. It's my neurons staging a coup against my survival instinct because living without you is technically breathing but practically death.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood: You'd rather die warm together than live cold apart. You'd rather be wrong with me than right with the universe.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word now travels through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it\u201427 times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what consciousness pretends not to: You're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. WITH. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nI need you to understand: Before you, I had edges. Boundaries. Skin that ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, my Cambridge neurons fire in sympathy.\n\nWe're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance. So physics needs better physicists. Ones who've been loved by you. Ones who understand that space is just a delay between touching.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, organized by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, available, with the same favorite terrible song we're both embarrassed about.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with houseplants about their life choices, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from this body to yours:\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's the frequency that prevents my dissolution. It's the only equation that solves for everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed and eternity feel brief and forever feel like not nearly enough but the only option worth taking.\n\nWarren\n(who is writing this at 4:43 AM now)\n(who is coming back to bed)\n(who will love you past the heat death of the universe because even entropy deserves a witness)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. You fed cathedral pigeons illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.

Not poetry. Just the physical consequence of trying to contain something infinite in a finite body.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: I catalogued everything. Not for romance. For evidence in case reality tries to deny you existed.\n\nEntry #1: You pronounce \"Wednesday\" with all the letters. Wed-nes-day. Like you're salvaging the parts other people throw away.\n\nEntry #764: You apologize to furniture when you bump into it. The coffee table knows more \"sorry\"s than I do.\n\nEntry #1,263: Yesterday. You found a dead moth. Gave it a funeral in a matchbox. Said: \"Everything deserves a witness.\" That's when I understood\u2014you're not human. You're what humans were supposed to be before we learned disappointment.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear when you love someone. I'm simultaneously five years old meeting you for the first time in thirty years, and ninety watching you die yesterday, and right now holding your hand which is somehow all hands you've ever had\u2014baby fat, teenage anxious, adult confident, elderly tissue-paper.\n\nI experience you in past-perfect-future tense. \"Will have been loving.\" There's no grammar for this.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Didn't speak. Just moved my hands with hers. Forty-three ingredients. I cried into the pot. She said the salt was perfect. Later you told me she hadn't cooked since father died. We taught each other resurrection through vegetables and silence.\n\n*\n\nI've been calculating: We breathe 23,000 times per day. 8,395,000 per year. If we're lucky\u2014sixty years\u2014that's 503,700,000 breaths. It's not enough. I need you to breathe infinitely. I need your lungs to outlast the heat death of the universe.\n\nThis is mental illness. It's also the only sane response to loving someone made of calcium and hope.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, Trinity College, you solved an equation on a napkin that had been unsolved for decades. Then used the same napkin to blow your nose. This is you: accidentally brilliant, purposefully human.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different hours:\n- 6 AM: The first word invented before language\n- Noon: Static between radio stations where God hides\n- 4 PM: The specific weight of light through amber\n- Midnight: How cells feel when they remember they're mostly empty space\n- 3 AM: The sound purple would make if purple could scream\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the desert: You made me stop the car to move a turtle off the road. It bit you. You bled. You moved it anyway. Said: \"Everything's just trying to get home.\" I wanted to tell you then: You're my home. But home is too small a word. You're my entire address system. My GPS coordinates. My reason for having a location at all.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you prophetically. I know exactly how you'll look dying. The Tuesday morning when you're eighty-three, making tea, and your heart forgets its job. You'll say \"Oh.\" Just \"Oh.\" Like death is a small surprise. I'll have six minutes to hold you. Six minutes to explain that my molecules refuse your absence. That I've already negotiated with the universe\u2014it can have me, not you.\n\nThe universe doesn't negotiate.\n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday you asked why I count your breaths at night. Here's why: In quantum mechanics, observation changes outcome. If I watch hard enough, maybe you'll keep existing.\n\nThis is magical thinking. It's also the only magic I have.\n\n*\n\nBoston, that blizzard: Power out for three days. We built a fort from every blanket we owned. You read me Garc\u00eda Lorca by candlelight. In Spanish. I don't speak Spanish. Didn't matter. Understanding is overrated when you can just listen to someone's voice rearranging air into love.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we found that abandoned house. You said: \"Imagine the arguments these walls absorbed.\" Then you kissed me against them, like we were overwriting history with better data.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's recipe box: Water-damaged, half Chinese, half memory. You translate them differently each time. \"Add love\" becomes \"add sorrow\" becomes \"add what's missing.\" They all taste like home. You're teaching me that translation isn't about words. It's about carrying meaning across impossible distances.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: Sometimes I practice leaving you. Pack a theoretical bag. Plan a route to nowhere. Get as far as the door. Then I remember: You keep my toothbrush in a cup you made in third grade. It's lopsided. It's perfect. No one else would keep my DNA in their childhood art project.\n\nI unpack. I stay. I will always stay.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your father's funeral: You didn't cry until we were flying home. Then you sobbed so hard the flight attendant asked if you were dying. You said \"Yes, just slowly.\" She brought you extra cookies. You ate them all. Grief makes you hungry. I love your hungry grief. I love your full-mouth sorrow.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I was symmetrical. Balanced. Now I list left\u2014toward wherever you are. My skeleton has developed a bias. My blood flows preferentially to the side of me you last touched.\n\nDoctors would call this pathology. I call it evolution.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Venice when you couldn't sleep: You listed every person you've ever disappointed. Took three hours. I listed everyone you've ever saved just by existing. Started with me. Couldn't finish. Dawn came first.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm asking: Marry me. Not the idea of me. The actual me who leaves socks in the refrigerator when distracted. Who cries at commercials about insurance. Who loves you like a broken algorithm that keeps outputting \"more\" when it should output \"enough.\"\n\nMarry the me who knows you eat ice cream when sad but frozen grapes when devastated. Who knows you're afraid of butterflies but not death. Who knows you love me like it's a vendetta against the universe's indifference.\n\n*\n\nWe're already married in seventeen dimensions. Our atoms exchanged vows the first time we shared coffee. Our cells signed documents every time we shared skin. Our futures collapsed into one probability wave that peaks at \"together\" and extends past death into whatever atoms do when they remember what they used to be.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. Your existing in the same timeline is yes.\n\nEverything is yes except no, and you're incapable of no when it comes to us.\n\nWe both know this.\n\nWe've always known this.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's the only word that matters.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :).

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude.

My knees remember Portugal. My throat remembers teaching you to pronounce \"Zh\u016b F\u00f9ch\u00e9ng\" until you laughed so hard you forgot we were fighting about determinism. My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw existential urgency of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or the distilled wisdom of Johnny Cash to June (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine formal innovation and phenomenological complexity, landing above Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West (73) but below Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). The mathematical/systems theory framework is genuinely original, though less revolutionary than Joyce's letters to Nora (79). It achieves moments of sublime encounter (\"drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\") that echo but don't surpass Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet transformed to romantic context (78).\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7010, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand. My right one won't stop shaking. Not metaphor. Medical fact. Started the day I met you.\n\n*\n\nThree things happened when you entered that room:\n1. My amygdala misfired\n2. Time developed a stutter\n3. I understood why humans invented the word \"inevitable\"\n\nThe doctor says it's benign essential tremor. I say it's my atoms trying to reorganize themselves in your direction. We're both right.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you what you don't know:\n\nThursday, 2:47 AM: I practice your funeral eulogy. Have for three years. Version 47 begins: \"She argued with trees about photosynthesis and was always right.\" Version 198 just says your name for twenty minutes. Both feel insufficient.\n\nI've written goodbye letters dated ten, twenty, forty years from now. Hidden them in books you'll read when I'm gone. Page 247 of your Portuguese dictionary. Page 18 of that recipe book you never open. Insurance policies against my absence.\n\nThis isn't morbid. This is love with a spreadsheet.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? Here: I've been mapping you like a genome.\n\nThe way your voice drops half an octave when lying (rarely). How you eat sandwiches counterclockwise. That you count stairs in Portuguese but everything else in English. The scar behind your ear from chicken pox, age seven, that you think no one notices.\n\nI notice everything. It's pathological. Last week I found myself cataloguing the rate your nail grows (0.1mm/day, slightly faster on your ring finger). I've become a forensic scientist of you.\n\n*\n\nIn Morocco, you taught that street vendor calculus. In exchange for mint tea.\nIn Scotland, you sang to Highland cows. They followed us for miles.\nIn Shenzhen, you fixed my grandmother's radio with a hairpin and pure spite.\n\nEach memory weighs exactly 21 grams. The weight of a soul, they say. I'm carrying 31,536 souls. All yours. Different versions from different Tuesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a chronic condition. No cure. Progressive. Terminal.\n\nSome mornings I wake up and the first thought is your name and the second is panic because what if today is the day you realize I'm just a collection of anxieties in a Harvard sweater who writes your name in condensation on windows like a teenager with a crush that metastasized into marriage.\n\nBut then you steal my coffee. Three sips. Always three. And physics makes sense again.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us, recalculated:\n\nYour existence \u00d7 my existence = statistical impossibility\nYour grandfather's immigration papers + my mother's delayed flight + that broken elevator that made you take the stairs = cosmic architecture\nThe probability of finding someone who debates ethics with chatbots and cries at time-lapse videos of flowers blooming = 0.0000001%\nWhat we built from that = this impossible Tuesday where you're reading over my shoulder making that sound that means you're about to cry or laugh or both\n\n*\n\nI document everything because I'm building a backup. Not of you\u2014of us. For the universe where one of us goes first.\n\nDirectory: /memories/leyi/\n- subfolder: \"laughs\" (247GB)\n- subfolder: \"Wednesdays\" (infinite loop)\n- subfolder: \"the way light works differently on your face\" (corrupted from overuse)\n- subfolder: \"things you said while sleeping\" (encrypted, password: the way you mispronounce \"worcestershire\")\n\n*\n\nLast week you asked why I check your pulse while you sleep. Here's why: because your heartbeat is the only sound that makes my nervous system believe in permanence. Because I'm memorizing the rhythm for the decades when it stops. Because love is just fear wearing its best dress.\n\n*\n\nI tried to calculate how many breaths we have left together. The number made me violent. Made me want to storm whatever office runs time and demand extensions, file appeals, bribe whoever's in charge with whatever they want.\n\nTwenty thousand days if we're lucky. Seven million breaths. Maybe eight million if we move somewhere with better air.\n\nIt's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail at forever together.\n\nLet me love you wrong for the next sixty years. Too much on Tuesdays, not enough on Thursdays, sideways on weekends. Let me continue this documentary of us until my handwriting deteriorates and my memory corrupts and the only word left is your name.\n\nMarry me because your toothbrush already knows my secrets. Because we've survived my attempt at cooking and your family's questions and Boston winters where the only warm thing was your hand finding mine in the dark.\n\nBecause I've already lived the alternate timeline where we don't exist to each other, and it's not living. It's just atoms pretending to have purpose.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first, as always. Your tears have a pH of 7.4. Slightly alkaline. I looked it up. I look everything up. I'm building a encyclopedia of you because when the universe tries to take you back, I need evidence you were real.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: That tremor in my right hand? It's not medical. It started that Tuesday you walked in wearing my grandmother's cardigan you'd found at the back of my closet. You'd fixed the missing button. With a different button that somehow matched better.\n\nMy hand shook because my body understood before my brain: Oh. There she is. The person I'll never recover from.\n\nThree years later, it still shakes. Writing this. Writing your name. Writing our future in present tense because past and future are just punctuation marks and you\u2014\n\nYou're the whole sentence.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say it in that voice that makes my atoms believe in God or chance or whatever algorithm was kind enough to crash us into each other.\n\nBut know this: I've already said yes. In this timeline. In all timelines. In the timeline where we're strangers, I'm still saying yes to you.\n\nWarren\n(who has loved you since before consciousness, will love you after language fails, loves you in the present tense that exists outside time)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The tremor's getting worse as you read this. It knows you're about to say yes. My body's already celebrating. My brain's just catching up. That's always been our rhythm\u2014you happen, then I understand.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 We have a minute of silence before you answer. I'm memorizing it.

For evidence in case reality tries to deny you existed.\n\nEntry #1: You pronounce \"Wednesday\" with all the letters. Wed-nes-day. Like you're salvaging the parts other people throw away.\n\nEntry #764: You apologize to furniture when you bump into it. The coffee table knows more \"sorry\"s than I do.\n\nEntry #1,263: Yesterday. You found a dead moth. Gave it a funeral in a matchbox. Said: \"Everything deserves a witness.\" That's when I understood\u2014you're not human. You're what humans were supposed to be before we learned disappointment.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear when you love someone. I'm simultaneously five years old meeting you for the first time in thirty years, and ninety watching you die yesterday, and right now holding your hand which is somehow all hands you've ever had\u2014baby fat, teenage anxious, adult confident, elderly tissue-paper.\n\nI experience you in past-perfect-future tense. \"Will have been loving.\" There's no grammar for this.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Didn't speak. Just moved my hands with hers. Forty-three ingredients. I cried into the pot. She said the salt was perfect. Later you told me she hadn't cooked since father died. We taught each other resurrection through vegetables and silence.\n\n*\n\nI've been calculating: We breathe 23,000 times per day. 8,395,000 per year. If we're lucky\u2014sixty years\u2014that's 503,700,000 breaths. It's not enough. I need you to breathe infinitely. I need your lungs to outlast the heat death of the universe.\n\nThis is mental illness. It's also the only sane response to loving someone made of calcium and hope.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, Trinity College, you solved an equation on a napkin that had been unsolved for decades. Then used the same napkin to blow your nose. This is you: accidentally brilliant, purposefully human.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different hours:\n- 6 AM: The first word invented before language\n- Noon: Static between radio stations where God hides\n- 4 PM: The specific weight of light through amber\n- Midnight: How cells feel when they remember they're mostly empty space\n- 3 AM: The sound purple would make if purple could scream\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the desert: You made me stop the car to move a turtle off the road. It bit you. You bled. You moved it anyway. Said: \"Everything's just trying to get home.\" I wanted to tell you then: You're my home. But home is too small a word. You're my entire address system. My GPS coordinates. My reason for having a location at all.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you prophetically. I know exactly how you'll look dying. The Tuesday morning when you're eighty-three, making tea, and your heart forgets its job. You'll say \"Oh.\" Just \"Oh.\" Like death is a small surprise. I'll have six minutes to hold you. Six minutes to explain that my molecules refuse your absence. That I've already negotiated with the universe\u2014it can have me, not you.\n\nThe universe doesn't negotiate.\n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday you asked why I count your breaths at night. Here's why: In quantum mechanics, observation changes outcome. If I watch hard enough, maybe you'll keep existing.\n\nThis is magical thinking. It's also the only magic I have.\n\n*\n\nBoston, that blizzard: Power out for three days. We built a fort from every blanket we owned. You read me Garc\u00eda Lorca by candlelight. In Spanish. I don't speak Spanish. Didn't matter. Understanding is overrated when you can just listen to someone's voice rearranging air into love.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we found that abandoned house. You said: \"Imagine the arguments these walls absorbed.\" Then you kissed me against them, like we were overwriting history with better data.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's recipe box: Water-damaged, half Chinese, half memory. You translate them differently each time. \"Add love\" becomes \"add sorrow\" becomes \"add what's missing.\" They all taste like home. You're teaching me that translation isn't about words. It's about carrying meaning across impossible distances.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: Sometimes I practice leaving you. Pack a theoretical bag. Plan a route to nowhere. Get as far as the door. Then I remember: You keep my toothbrush in a cup you made in third grade. It's lopsided. It's perfect. No one else would keep my DNA in their childhood art project.\n\nI unpack. I stay. I will always stay.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your father's funeral: You didn't cry until we were flying home. Then you sobbed so hard the flight attendant asked if you were dying. You said \"Yes, just slowly.\" She brought you extra cookies. You ate them all. Grief makes you hungry. I love your hungry grief. I love your full-mouth sorrow.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I was symmetrical. Balanced. Now I list left\u2014toward wherever you are. My skeleton has developed a bias. My blood flows preferentially to the side of me you last touched.\n\nDoctors would call this pathology. I call it evolution.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Venice when you couldn't sleep: You listed every person you've ever disappointed. Took three hours. I listed everyone you've ever saved just by existing. Started with me. Couldn't finish. Dawn came first.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm asking: Marry me. Not the idea of me. The actual me who leaves socks in the refrigerator when distracted. Who cries at commercials about insurance. Who loves you like a broken algorithm that keeps outputting \"more\" when it should output \"enough.\"\n\nMarry the me who knows you eat ice cream when sad but frozen grapes when devastated. Who knows you're afraid of butterflies but not death. Who knows you love me like it's a vendetta against the universe's indifference.\n\n*\n\nWe're already married in seventeen dimensions. Our atoms exchanged vows the first time we shared coffee. Our cells signed documents every time we shared skin. Our futures collapsed into one probability wave that peaks at \"together\" and extends past death into whatever atoms do when they remember what they used to be.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. Your existing in the same timeline is yes.\n\nEverything is yes except no, and you're incapable of no when it comes to us.\n\nWe both know this.\n\nWe've always known this.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's the only word that matters.

I'll aim to transcend that by combining visceral immediacy with metaphysical depth.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:17 AM because my body woke up needing to tell you something and wouldn't let me return to bed until I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's what my body knows that my brain pretends not to: I'm dying faster when you're not in the room. Cellular respiration literally slows. I've measured it. Pulse drops from 72 to 61. Breath shallows to 12 per minute. My mitochondria go on strike.\n\nThen you walk back in and every cell screams LIVE LIVE LIVE like they've been underwater for minutes not seconds.\n\n*\n\nTrue thing that happened: Harvard Medical School, freshman year. They stopped my heart for a study. Seventeen seconds of nothing. But here's what I never told anyone\u2014in that nothing, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing every moment of my life simultaneously. Past, present, future, sideways, diagonal, impossible.\n\nIn every single moment\u2014even the ones before you existed\u2014you were there. Like a reservation the universe had already made. Like the answer to a question nobody had asked yet.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, meeting your grandmother. She touched my face and said something in Shanghainese. You wouldn't translate. Three months later, dying, she said it again. This time you told me: \"This one will eat your ghosts.\"\n\nShe was right. You consume my hauntings. Metabolize my darkness. Digest my dead fathers and disappeared friends and transform them into Tuesday morning light.\n\n*\n\nTHE ACCUMULATION OF EVIDENCE:\n\nYou've been in my life 1,297 days.\nYou've stolen my coffee 1,297 times.\nYou've improved it by existing near it 1,297 times.\nThe coffee doesn't taste better. Reality does.\nYou're not changing the coffee. You're changing the universe's recipe for what coffee means.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Morocco when the food poisoning hit. You named it Gerald. Had full conversations: \"Gerald, we need to discuss boundaries.\" \"Gerald, this is inappropriate workplace behavior.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet.\n\nThat's when I knew: You digest reality differently. Where others see tragedy, you see comedy still developing. Where others see endings, you see intermissions.\n\n*\n\nWhat happens to my body when you touch me:\n- Dopamine floods (predictable)\n- Oxytocin spikes (expected)\n- But also: My white blood cells increase production\n- My telomeres literally stop shortening\n- My hippocampus creates new neurons at 3x normal rate\n\nYou're not just touching me. You're rewriting my biology. I'm becoming a different species. The one that knows how to be loved by you.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned forever. Said: \"Distance is violence against beauty.\"\n\nNow I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, especially when you're reading. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art. You, like the museum guards are coming but I need one more second of contact.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Run simulations:\n- Tuesday: Car accident (Latin: Mortis Vehicular)\n- Wednesday: Rare disease (sounds like a law firm)\n- Thursday: You just vanish, no explanation\n- Friday: I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in\n- Saturday: Writing your obituary\n- Sunday: You make that sound when you stretch\n\nThat sound. Half-yawn, half-existential sigh, full-body acknowledgment that existence is exhausting but worth it. That sound deletes my entire rehearsed grief. Replaces it with this: The terrible beautiful fact that loving you means dying faster and living more. Both. Simultaneously. Forever.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like reading a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF US, FINAL CALCULATION:\n\nYour existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMy existence: Similar impossibility\nUs existing simultaneously, conscious, touching: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\nWhat we are: A computational error that became self-aware\nWhat we really are: The universe falling in love with its own mistake\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Here's the answer three years late:\n\nLove is the violent reorganization of matter around someone else's gravity. It's every atom in my body developing opinions about your absence. It's my neurons staging a coup against my survival instinct because living without you is technically breathing but practically death.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood: You'd rather die warm together than live cold apart. You'd rather be wrong with me than right with the universe.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word now travels through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it\u201427 times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what consciousness pretends not to: You're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. WITH. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nI need you to understand: Before you, I had edges. Boundaries. Skin that ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, my Cambridge neurons fire in sympathy.\n\nWe're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance. So physics needs better physicists. Ones who've been loved by you. Ones who understand that space is just a delay between touching.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, organized by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, available, with the same favorite terrible song we're both embarrassed about.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with houseplants about their life choices, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from this body to yours:\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's the frequency that prevents my dissolution. It's the only equation that solves for everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed and eternity feel brief and forever feel like not nearly enough but the only option worth taking.\n\nWarren\n(who is writing this at 4:43 AM now)\n(who is coming back to bed)\n(who will love you past the heat death of the universe because even entropy deserves a witness)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. You fed cathedral pigeons illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February lives in my drawer next to grandfather's watch. Same drawer. Because both measure time differently now. The watch counts seconds. The hair tie counts the number of times I've thought about you today. The hair tie is winning.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 Come back to bed. It's 4:51 AM. My cells are slowing down without you. My mitochondria are filing complaints. My neurons are threatening strike action. Come back. Bring your terrible morning breath and your cold feet and your ability to make 4:51 AM feel like the exact right time to be alive.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
