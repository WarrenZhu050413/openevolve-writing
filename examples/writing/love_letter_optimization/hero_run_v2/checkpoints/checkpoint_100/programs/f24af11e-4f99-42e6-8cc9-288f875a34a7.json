You could disappear\u2014car accident, sudden illness, better options. I keep backup plans for your absence. None of them work.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, February 2019. Want to know what I learned? Nothing mystical. Just this: the body knows what it wants before the brain catches up. My heart stopped but my hand kept reaching. The nurse said I was grabbing at air. \n\nWrong. I was practicing holding you. Three years early.\n\n*\n\nThe Wednesday you mispronounced my name\u2014you made it rhyme with \"ruin.\" Prophetic. Now I can't sleep without checking you're breathing.

Take advantage of your background, but not overly so as it is cliche. Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

You could disappear\u2014car accident, sudden illness, better options. I keep backup plans for your absence. None of them work.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, February 2019. Want to know what I learned? Nothing mystical. Just this: the body knows what it wants before the brain catches up. My heart stopped but my hand kept reaching. The nurse said I was grabbing at air. \n\nWrong. I was practicing holding you. Three years early.\n\n*\n\nThe Wednesday you mispronounced my name\u2014you made it rhyme with \"ruin.\" Prophetic. Now I can't sleep without checking you're breathing. Can't eat breakfast without saving you half. Can't write code without variable names that sound like your laugh.\n\nYou've corrupted my source files. I'm not debugging it.\n\n*\n\nMore evidence: In Granada, you cried at the Alhambra's mathematics. In Marrakech, you argued with a carpet seller about quantum mechanics. In Edinburgh, you befriended a cemetery cat named Douglas.\n\nI have 400GB of photos where you're blurry because you won't stop moving, stop thinking, stop becoming more yourself every second.\n\nThe storage isn't enough. Nothing's enough.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I love you wrong. Like an error message that won't resolve.

The math is offensive. I want to sue time, demand a recount, hack the cosmic database.\n\nBut also: those Tuesdays in our kitchen. You, explaining machine learning to houseplants. Me, memorizing how many sugars you need at different hours (7 AM: two, 3 PM: none, 11 PM: three).\n\nThis is what I'm saying: You're not my better half. You're my entire strange equation. The variable that makes everything unsolvable and finally worth solving.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your coffee mug already knows the shape of my hands. Because we've survived Boston winters and my cooking and your family asking about grandchildren. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where your particular arrangement of atoms collided with mine at the exact angle necessary for recognition.\n\nBecause the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't know you take your shoes off left-first, always, even when it's illogical\u2014isn't life. It's just biochemistry happening to strangers.\n\n*\n\nFinal data point: Your name. Leyi. Two syllables that reorganized my molecular structure.\n\nI practice saying it in my sleep.
