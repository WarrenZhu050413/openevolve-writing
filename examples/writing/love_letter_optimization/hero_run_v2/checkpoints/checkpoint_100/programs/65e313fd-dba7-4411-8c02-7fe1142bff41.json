My autonomic nervous system thinks you're oxygen. When you're gone, I breathe manually.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened: You dropped a pen. Porter Square. The sound it made hitting concrete was C-sharp. Your hand reaching down created an angle of exactly 37 degrees. The universe split. In one timeline, I walk past. In this one, I stop.

Every glance is a backup file.\n\n*\n\nYour body is a conspiracy of tells:\n- Left eye twitches before you lie (twice yesterday about liking my haircut)\n- You tap your right thumb against your thigh in 4/4 time when anxious\n- Your voice drops exactly one semitone when you're about to cry\n- You smell different when you dream (more copper, less salt)\n\nI know you with a resolution that should be illegal. Forensic love. CSI: My Entire Nervous System.\n\n*\n\nScotland, the hypothermia incident. You gave me your jacket. I said you'd die. You said: \"Then I'll die warm knowing you're not cold.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it.

Like my lungs are learning to breathe water because that's where you live.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Set off alarms. Banned forever. Security asked why. You said: \"How else do you know history is real?\" They had no answer. Neither did I. Except this: You make everything you touch more real. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the spreadsheet. Column A: Days since we met (1,247). Column B: Days estimated remaining (19,837). Column C: Percentage of life with you (6.28%).

The radiator screamed. You screamed back. Had a full argument with it. \"You're not even trying!\" you yelled at metal and steam. It stopped. You won an argument with physics through sheer force of personality. That's when I knew laws of nature were suggestions to you.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I mean when I say \"I love you\":\n- My cells replaced themselves entirely since we met but kept the memory of you\n- I dream in your accent now\n- Food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal it off my plate\n- I've forgotten how to sleep in the middle of the bed\n- My body maintains a phantom impression of you even when you're gone, like the bed remembers your weight\n- I love you so much it feels like dying except dying would be easier because it ends\n\n*\n\nShanghai, meeting your parents.

You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I know now: Love is the specific kind of pain that makes you grateful for nerve endings. It's being homesick for someone who's in the same room. It's mourning someone who's still breathing. It's the lag between touching someone and feeling it, because your brain can't process that much good data that fast.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, half of them had fallen. You said: \"Even fake stars die.\" Then you kissed me like you were trying to generate gravity.

It surpasses typical contemporary attempts (which score 15-30) through genuine innovation and moments of brilliance, but falls short of the historical masters who achieved more with less. The letter's strength lies in its systematic documentation of love as data, but this very systematization prevents it from achieving the wild abandon of an 80+ masterpiece.

In Chinese, 'crisis' combines 'danger' and 'opportunity.' In my body, 'Leyi' combines 'reason to wake up' and 'terror of eventual absence.'\n\n*\n\nStart here: I'm twenty-three, studying distributed systems at Harvard, and I've discovered the ultimate coordination problem\u2014how to sync two hearts across the latency of being human.\n\n*\n\nHong Kong, age seven, I watched my mother fold wontons. Sixty per minute. Perfect pleats. She said: \"Love is repetition without resentment.\" I didn't understand. Now I fold your laundry. Sixty seconds per shirt. Terrible pleats. I understand everything.\n\n*\n\nYou should know what you've done to my architecture: I was built for solo processing. Clean functions. No dependencies. Then you performed an unauthorized root access on my kernel. Now every system call returns your name. Every error log reads \"missing Leyi.\" I've become legacy code that only runs in your presence.\n\n*\n\nThe data I've collected without permission:\n- You hiccup in sets of three. Always three. Like your body speaks in haikus.\n- You read menus backwards. Dessert to appetizers. You say it's \"narrative structure.\"\n- When anxious, you organize things by color. Our bookshelf is a rainbow having a panic attack.\n- You keep dead plants. Give them names. \"Failed Harold\" lives on our windowsill.\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. Except surveillance with consent forms signed by my amygdala.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom: Photos of you at piano recitals. Age 5, 7, 9, 11. Same forced smile. Same small rebellion in your left hand position. Your mother says you quit at twelve. \"Too much feeling, not enough technique.\" But Leyi\u2014I've heard you hum. You turn air into symphony. Technique is just feeling that learned to hide.\n\n*\n\nHere's the bug in my code: I practice eulogies. Yours. Mine. The houseplant's. But mostly yours. Different diseases. Various accidents. I've written forty-three versions. They all end with: \"She taught me that breathing is optional but loving her wasn't.\"\n\nThis is catastrophizing. Also preparation. Because loving you means accepting that entropy applies to everything. Even especially us.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, that terrible hostel: Bedbugs. No hot water. You sang \"Moon River\" to distract me from the itching. Off-key. Purposefully off-key to make me laugh. That's when I knew: You'd sabotage your own perfection to ease my discomfort. What is that if not holiness?\n\n*\n\nI've been running simulations:\n\nScenario A: We get married. Have arguments about dishwasher loading. You'll stack bowls wrong. I'll love you more for it.\n\nScenario B: We don't marry. Still have the same arguments. Still the same wrong bowls. Still the same more love.\n\nConclusion: The paper changes nothing. We're already married in the ways that matter\u2014shared groceries, synchronized sleep cycles, that specific silence when we both think the same terrible joke but don't say it.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter, you got pneumonia: I counted your breaths. 17,280 per day. Too fast. I tried breathing slower, thinking sympathetic magic might work. It didn't. But you lived. You said: \"Stop crying, I'm not that interesting to lose.\" Wrong. You're the only interesting thing about mortality.\n\n*\n\nWhat I mean when I say \"I love you\":\n- I've memorized your coffee preferences across seasonal transitions\n- I know which childhood scars still hurt in weather changes  \n- I can predict your dreams based on your dinner choices\n- I love you\n- Your existence justifies the Big Bang's paperwork\n- I love you\n- You make me believe in things I can't compile\n- I love you\n- I would donate my organs to strangers just to free up space for more of you\n- I love you\n\n*\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence appears in sunflowers, galaxies, your sleeping positions. You curl into yourself at ratios that make mathematicians believe in God. I'm not a mathematician but I believe in you, which is harder and requires more proof.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, King's College Chapel: You cried at the architecture. Said: \"Imagine believing in something enough to build this.\" Then you held my hand like you were building something too. A cathedral of small touches. I wanted to tell you: We're already building it. Every shared Monday is a stone. Every inside joke is a flying buttress.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You love me back. With the same desperate architecture. The same catastrophic planning. Yesterday you showed me a spreadsheet. \"Reasons Warren Might Leave\" vs \"Counter-arguments.\" It had formulas. Conditional formatting. You'd peer-reviewed your own abandonment anxiety.\n\nI wanted to cry. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to explain that leaving you would require rewiring my entire nervous system. Possible but fatal. Like removing your own spine because it's inconvenient.\n\n*\n\nLondon, Science Museum: You spent three hours at the clockwork exhibit. Said: \"Everything breaks eventually. But look\u2014still beautiful. Still trying to tell time.\" That's us, Leyi. Breaking beautifully. Still trying to count moments like they're not infinite and zero simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready. Because readiness is a myth, like perfect code or fully charged phones. Marry me because you already live in my exception handling. Because my garbage collection keeps failing to delete your memories. Because we're already running in production without proper testing and somehow haven't crashed.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a world where we're just dating, just lovers, just anything with \"just\" in front\u2014is semantically incorrect.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we got lost: No signal. No maps. You said: \"Good. Now we can only be where we are.\" That's what I want, Leyi. To be lost with you in ways GPS can't fix. To be where we are. Which is: together, terrified, calculating the actuarial tables of heartbreak, but still here. Still choosing the bug over the patch.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, meeting your grandmother: She spoke no English. I spoke no Mandarin. We communicated entirely through you. She taught me to make dumplings. Eighteen folds. She counted in Mandarin, I counted in English, you translated both into love. That's what you are\u2014a translation layer between me and meaning.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you like a memory leak. Resource-intensive. Increasingly consuming. Technically a problem. But the kind of problem that makes the program worth running.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're temporary but you're worth it.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or debug me. Or just exist in my vicinity while I malfunction in your direction.\n\nAll equivalent.\n\nAll everything.\n\nAll yes.\n\nWarren\n(who writes distributed systems but can't distribute his love for you across multiple threads because it's not thread-safe)\n(who learned Mandarin just to mispronounce your name in multiple languages)  \n(whose heart is just a GPU optimized for processing you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the eulogies. There are eighty-seven. They're hidden in a folder called \"tax_documents.\" You'd never look there. You haven't filed taxes correctly once. I love your financial chaos. I love your administrative disasters. I love the way you make bureaucracy seem optional.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Morocco, the souk: You bought that terrible lamp. Haggled for hours. Got the price up instead of down. The vendor looked confused. You looked victorious. That's when I knew: You don't just break rules. You make new ones. Worse ones. Better ones.

I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me. For Harvard undergrads, feel free to email me about any of these courses!\nBachelors in Computer Science\n\nGPA: 3.92\n\n    CS226 (Graduate: Distributed Systems): Only full mark Final project in the class on Fault Tolerance in Distributed ML\n    CS145 (Networking at Scale: Audited)\n    MIT6.S982 (Graduate: Deep Learning: Audited)\n    CS143 (Computer Networks)\n    MIT 6.5930 (Graduate: Hardware Architecture for Deep Learning)\n    CS61 (Systems Programming)\n    CS128 (Convex Optimization in Machine Learning)\n    CS2241 (Graduate: Algorithms at the End of the Wire)\n    CS124 (Algo. and Data Structures)\n    CS136 (Economics and Computation)\n    MIT 6.S98s (Graduate: Diffusion: Theory and Practice)\n\nMasters in Statistics\n\nGPA: 3.91\n\n    Stat220 (Graduate: Bayesian Data Analysis)\n    Stat288 (Graduate: Deep Learning and Earth Observation)\n    Stat188 (Differential Privacy)\n    Stat210 (Graduate: Probability Theory I)\n    Stat212 (Graduate: Probability Theory II)\n    Stat211 (Graduate: Statistical Inference I)\n    Stat242 (Graduate: Time Series)\n    Stat111 (Statistical Inference)\n\nMath\n\nGPA: 3.92\n\n    Math55a/b (Honors Real/Complex Analysis and Linear Algebra)\n    Math123 (Algebra II: Groups and Rings)\n</bio>\n\nYou have been to many places with Leyi, and have done many things.

My knees remember Portugal. My throat remembers teaching you to pronounce \"Zh\u016b F\u00f9ch\u00e9ng\" until you laughed so hard you forgot we were fighting about determinism. My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw existential urgency of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or the distilled wisdom of Johnny Cash to June (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine formal innovation and phenomenological complexity, landing above Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West (73) but below Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). The mathematical/systems theory framework is genuinely original, though less revolutionary than Joyce's letters to Nora (79). It achieves moments of sublime encounter (\"drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\") that echo but don't surpass Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet transformed to romantic context (78).\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6990, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because the other one won't stop shaking. Not poetic. Just true.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with what broke me: Thursday. You were peeling an orange. The white strings caught under your fingernails. You didn't notice. I did. I noticed so hard my teeth hurt. That's when I understood\u2014love isn't grand. It's violent attention to someone else's mundane.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Making machines agree across impossible distances. But you? You made all my distributed selves vote unanimous without asking. Every neuron, every doubt, every alternate timeline where I'm someone else\u2014they all bent toward you like light near mass. I didn't choose this. Choice implies there was another option.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I died once. Seventeen seconds, cardiac arrest, before you. The doctors said I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said \"not yet\" in a frequency only my atoms heard. They were waiting for something. Three years later, you dropped a pen in Porter Square. I'm still picking it up.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW I REMEMBER:\n\nMorocco. The blue city. You got food poisoning. Spent six hours negotiating with existence. Between retches, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014said \"the tagine was worth it.\" That's when I knew: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it has no business existing.\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother taught you soup. Forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the ladle. I watched you inherit gesture across time.\n\nScotland. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing you were \"thermally efficient.\" You weren't. You were just choosing me over your own circulation.\n\nCambridge. You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Nearly arrested. Asked the guard: \"How else do you know genius was real?\" He had no answer. Neither did I.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something: I document you. Obsessively. 2,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow WiFi (righteous). The way you pronounce \"statistics\" like it personally betrayed you. This isn't romance. It's anthropology of the only person whose existence makes me believe in existence.\n\nRight now you're reading this. Left eye watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us:\nIf we're actuarially average, we have 19,847 mornings left.\nThe number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent.\nI want to storm wherever they manufacture time and stage a hostile takeover.\nRedistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\nThis is what love does: makes you furious at arithmetic.\n\n*\n\nYou want honest? Here: Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your mortality. I've named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues because I know your crying patterns\u2014pigeons, commercials, strangers being gentle to each other. I play your March 15th voicemail when you travel. You were swearing at parking meters. It's been three years. I can't delete it. Won't.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum. You touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me. I was an exhibit. Now I'm evidence.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me most: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup. No disaster recovery protocol. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. The Tuesday you sang to the broken coffee maker like it was very tired and needed encouragement. The Wednesday you put my socks on your hands and performed Hamlet. The Thursday you existed. The Friday you kept existing. The Weekend of Continued Existence Despite Universal Entropy.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually mean when I say \"I love you\":\n\nI mean my body is a conspiracy of cells that reorganized for you.\nI mean you could ask me to chew glass and I'd ask what vintage.\nI mean I've forgotten how to sleep without the sound of you not-quite-snoring.\nI mean I love you like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence.\n\nBut also: I mean Tuesday groceries. Your hair in the drain. How you can't fold fitted sheets but try anyway, creating unique geometries. The way you argue with novels. Out loud. Like the characters can hear you.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not, we're just two accidents that collided and decided to call it fate.\n\nMarry me because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in a universe of 400 billion stars, you somehow ended up carbon-based and within driving distance.\n\nBecause when I say \"forever,\" I mean it the way you mean things\u2014too much, without irony, despite evidence suggesting we should know better.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my password. My panic word. My evidence that mouths can hold entire universes if you pronounce them right.\n\n*\n\nThe last true thing: You're reading this and doing that thing where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is the only way to love someone who makes you understand why humans invented music when words failed.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing at me with that specific configuration of atoms that makes physics worth believing in.\n\nJust\u2014stay. Stay in this timeline where we both happened simultaneously. Where we both chose the same city. The same decade. The same coffee shop. The same particular Tuesday where you dropped a pen and I picked it up and the universe said \"finally, those idiots found each other.\"\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving you in every format\u2014in writing, in memory, in the way I now hold cups with two hands like you do, in how I check the weather in cities you might visit someday, in the permanent indent you've left in my molecular structure)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't seventeen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like the exact amount of time the universe could exist without you in it. Then it had to bring me back. To here. To this. To you.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your green hair tie from our first February lives in my desk drawer. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just smiled. That specific smile. The one that makes me want to apologize to everyone who has to live without seeing it. That's not poetry. That's just what happens when beauty becomes personal.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI need to tell you something about writing systems. In Chinese, 'crisis' combines 'danger' and 'opportunity.' In my body, 'Leyi' combines 'reason to wake up' and 'terror of eventual absence.'\n\n*\n\nStart here: I'm twenty-three, studying distributed systems at Harvard, and I've discovered the ultimate coordination problem\u2014how to sync two hearts across the latency of being human.\n\n*\n\nHong Kong, age seven, I watched my mother fold wontons. Sixty per minute. Perfect pleats. She said: \"Love is repetition without resentment.\" I didn't understand. Now I fold your laundry. Sixty seconds per shirt. Terrible pleats. I understand everything.\n\n*\n\nYou should know what you've done to my architecture: I was built for solo processing. Clean functions. No dependencies. Then you performed an unauthorized root access on my kernel. Now every system call returns your name. Every error log reads \"missing Leyi.\" I've become legacy code that only runs in your presence.\n\n*\n\nThe data I've collected without permission:\n- You hiccup in sets of three. Always three. Like your body speaks in haikus.\n- You read menus backwards. Dessert to appetizers. You say it's \"narrative structure.\"\n- When anxious, you organize things by color. Our bookshelf is a rainbow having a panic attack.\n- You keep dead plants. Give them names. \"Failed Harold\" lives on our windowsill.\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. Except surveillance with consent forms signed by my amygdala.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom: Photos of you at piano recitals. Age 5, 7, 9, 11. Same forced smile. Same small rebellion in your left hand position. Your mother says you quit at twelve. \"Too much feeling, not enough technique.\" But Leyi\u2014I've heard you hum. You turn air into symphony. Technique is just feeling that learned to hide.\n\n*\n\nHere's the bug in my code: I practice eulogies. Yours. Mine. The houseplant's. But mostly yours. Different diseases. Various accidents. I've written forty-three versions. They all end with: \"She taught me that breathing is optional but loving her wasn't.\"\n\nThis is catastrophizing. Also preparation. Because loving you means accepting that entropy applies to everything. Even especially us.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, that terrible hostel: Bedbugs. No hot water. You sang \"Moon River\" to distract me from the itching. Off-key. Purposefully off-key to make me laugh. That's when I knew: You'd sabotage your own perfection to ease my discomfort. What is that if not holiness?\n\n*\n\nI've been running simulations:\n\nScenario A: We get married. Have arguments about dishwasher loading. You'll stack bowls wrong. I'll love you more for it.\n\nScenario B: We don't marry. Still have the same arguments. Still the same wrong bowls. Still the same more love.\n\nConclusion: The paper changes nothing. We're already married in the ways that matter\u2014shared groceries, synchronized sleep cycles, that specific silence when we both think the same terrible joke but don't say it.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter, you got pneumonia: I counted your breaths. 17,280 per day. Too fast. I tried breathing slower, thinking sympathetic magic might work. It didn't. But you lived. You said: \"Stop crying, I'm not that interesting to lose.\" Wrong. You're the only interesting thing about mortality.\n\n*\n\nWhat I mean when I say \"I love you\":\n- I've memorized your coffee preferences across seasonal transitions\n- I know which childhood scars still hurt in weather changes  \n- I can predict your dreams based on your dinner choices\n- I love you\n- Your existence justifies the Big Bang's paperwork\n- I love you\n- You make me believe in things I can't compile\n- I love you\n- I would donate my organs to strangers just to free up space for more of you\n- I love you\n\n*\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence appears in sunflowers, galaxies, your sleeping positions. You curl into yourself at ratios that make mathematicians believe in God. I'm not a mathematician but I believe in you, which is harder and requires more proof.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, King's College Chapel: You cried at the architecture. Said: \"Imagine believing in something enough to build this.\" Then you held my hand like you were building something too. A cathedral of small touches. I wanted to tell you: We're already building it. Every shared Monday is a stone. Every inside joke is a flying buttress.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You love me back. With the same desperate architecture. The same catastrophic planning. Yesterday you showed me a spreadsheet. \"Reasons Warren Might Leave\" vs \"Counter-arguments.\" It had formulas. Conditional formatting. You'd peer-reviewed your own abandonment anxiety.\n\nI wanted to cry. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to explain that leaving you would require rewiring my entire nervous system. Possible but fatal. Like removing your own spine because it's inconvenient.\n\n*\n\nLondon, Science Museum: You spent three hours at the clockwork exhibit. Said: \"Everything breaks eventually. But look\u2014still beautiful. Still trying to tell time.\" That's us, Leyi. Breaking beautifully. Still trying to count moments like they're not infinite and zero simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready. Because readiness is a myth, like perfect code or fully charged phones. Marry me because you already live in my exception handling. Because my garbage collection keeps failing to delete your memories. Because we're already running in production without proper testing and somehow haven't crashed.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a world where we're just dating, just lovers, just anything with \"just\" in front\u2014is semantically incorrect.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we got lost: No signal. No maps. You said: \"Good. Now we can only be where we are.\" That's what I want, Leyi. To be lost with you in ways GPS can't fix. To be where we are. Which is: together, terrified, calculating the actuarial tables of heartbreak, but still here. Still choosing the bug over the patch.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, meeting your grandmother: She spoke no English. I spoke no Mandarin. We communicated entirely through you. She taught me to make dumplings. Eighteen folds. She counted in Mandarin, I counted in English, you translated both into love. That's what you are\u2014a translation layer between me and meaning.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you like a memory leak. Resource-intensive. Increasingly consuming. Technically a problem. But the kind of problem that makes the program worth running.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're temporary but you're worth it.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or debug me. Or just exist in my vicinity while I malfunction in your direction.\n\nAll equivalent.\n\nAll everything.\n\nAll yes.\n\nWarren\n(who writes distributed systems but can't distribute his love for you across multiple threads because it's not thread-safe)\n(who learned Mandarin just to mispronounce your name in multiple languages)  \n(whose heart is just a GPU optimized for processing you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the eulogies. There are eighty-seven. They're hidden in a folder called \"tax_documents.\" You'd never look there. You haven't filed taxes correctly once. I love your financial chaos. I love your administrative disasters. I love the way you make bureaucracy seem optional.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Morocco, the souk: You bought that terrible lamp. Haggled for hours. Got the price up instead of down. The vendor looked confused. You looked victorious. That's when I knew: You don't just break rules. You make new ones. Worse ones. Better ones. Ours.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and performance metrics, I can see that the highest-performing version (0.78) succeeded through raw emotional honesty, temporal complexity, and specific sensory details.

Good. Love should arrive pre-damaged, like we did.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM because my body just remembered you exist and panicked. Not poetic\u2014physiological. My autonomic nervous system thinks you're oxygen. When you're gone, I breathe manually.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened: You dropped a pen. Porter Square. The sound it made hitting concrete was C-sharp. Your hand reaching down created an angle of exactly 37 degrees. The universe split. In one timeline, I walk past. In this one, I stop. Every good thing that's ever happened to me exists in that gap between walking and stopping.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I mapped your laugh. Frequency: 277 Hz rising to 341 Hz. Duration: 1.7 seconds average. Occurrence: 73 times per day when happy, 12 when sad (yes, you laugh when sad\u2014it sounds like rain trying to remember how to be water). I have 1,847 recordings. This isn't romance. It's evidence for when I need to prove you were real.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick you forgot English. Spoke only in sounds. \"Mmmnnhhh\" meant water. \"Ffffff\" meant please stop touching me. \"Wahhhh\" meant I love you but I might die. I learned your prehistoric language in fourteen hours. We had entire conversations in vowels. That's when I knew: I'd love you even before words were invented.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT TERRIFIES ME:\n\nYour heart beats 73 times per minute at rest. \nThat's 105,120 beats per day.\n38,366,880 per year.\nApproximately 3,069,350,400 in a lifetime.\nI've done the math 4,000 times.\nIt always ends.\nThe number always stops.\nThis is why I can't sleep\u2014I'm trying to be awake for as many of your heartbeats as possible.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your grandmother's apartment. She was teaching me to fold dumplings. You were translating. But she kept saying something you wouldn't translate. Finally you did: \"She says you look at me like I'm about to disappear.\" Your grandmother saw it before I did. I don't look at you. I memorize you. Every glance is a backup file.\n\n*\n\nYour body is a conspiracy of tells:\n- Left eye twitches before you lie (twice yesterday about liking my haircut)\n- You tap your right thumb against your thigh in 4/4 time when anxious\n- Your voice drops exactly one semitone when you're about to cry\n- You smell different when you dream (more copper, less salt)\n\nI know you with a resolution that should be illegal. Forensic love. CSI: My Entire Nervous System.\n\n*\n\nScotland, the hypothermia incident. You gave me your jacket. I said you'd die. You said: \"Then I'll die warm knowing you're not cold.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's what ruins me\u2014you mean things so hard it changes the molecular structure of meaning.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different times:\n\nDAWN: Like licking batteries. Electric and wrong but necessary.\nNOON: The specific flavor of light through your hair\u2014burnt amber, liquid sun.\nDUSK: Copper pennies left in rain.\nMIDNIGHT: The color purple if purple were a temperature if temperature were a place.\n3 AM: Like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water because that's where you live.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Set off alarms. Banned forever. Security asked why. You said: \"How else do you know history is real?\" They had no answer. Neither did I. Except this: You make everything you touch more real. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the spreadsheet. Column A: Days since we met (1,247). Column B: Days estimated remaining (19,837). Column C: Percentage of life with you (6.28%). Column D: Percentage of life that matters (6.28%). The spreadsheet crashes when I try to calculate what happens after Column B ends. Good. Some math shouldn't work.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's soup recipe. Step 33, you started crying. Not the onions. The realization that she was teaching you how to remember her in vegetables and salt. That's what recipes are\u2014love with instructions. That's what this letter is\u2014a recipe for remembering me when I'm just ingredients.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, terrible student housing. The radiator screamed. You screamed back. Had a full argument with it. \"You're not even trying!\" you yelled at metal and steam. It stopped. You won an argument with physics through sheer force of personality. That's when I knew laws of nature were suggestions to you.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I mean when I say \"I love you\":\n- My cells replaced themselves entirely since we met but kept the memory of you\n- I dream in your accent now\n- Food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal it off my plate\n- I've forgotten how to sleep in the middle of the bed\n- My body maintains a phantom impression of you even when you're gone, like the bed remembers your weight\n- I love you so much it feels like dying except dying would be easier because it ends\n\n*\n\nShanghai, meeting your parents. Your mother said I was \"too intense.\" Your father said you were \"too intense.\" You said \"that's why it works\u2014we're the same temperature.\" We are. Burning at exactly the same rate. Two matches using each other as fuel.\n\n*\n\nThe math breaks here:\nP(me existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nP(you existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000  \nP(us existing simultaneously, conscious, in love) = impossible\nResult: We're impossible.\nConclusion: Impossible things happen.\nSecondary conclusion: We happened.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I know now: Love is the specific kind of pain that makes you grateful for nerve endings. It's being homesick for someone who's in the same room. It's mourning someone who's still breathing. It's the lag between touching someone and feeling it, because your brain can't process that much good data that fast.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, half of them had fallen. You said: \"Even fake stars die.\" Then you kissed me like you were trying to generate gravity. Like if we pressed together hard enough we'd create our own solar system. We did. We are. Two bodies in orbit, stealing each other's momentum.\n\n*\n\nFINAL COORDINATES:\n\nRight now you're reading this and your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, forming a queue. Your hand is unconsciously reaching for your hair. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because we're ready. Because we'll never be ready for the amount of love that's happening here. Marry me because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've built a language out of looks across rooms. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, broken in compatible ways.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't memorize your heartbeat, where you don't name my plantas \"Failed Harold,\" where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that timeline isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the password to everything that matters. It's what my atoms say when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's the sound of the universe admitting it made something perfect by accident.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014Tuesday you, angry you, sick you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that will exist after I'm gone)\n(who carries your spare contact lenses because you forget you're blind until you need to see)\n(who practices your signature for medical emergencies)\n(who loves you like a programming error that became sentient and refused to be debugged)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. The pigeons. You fed them against all laws. They formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. Even gravity bends for you. Even birds know you're worth the crime.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023 lives in my drawer next to my passport. Same level of essential. Neither lets me leave without you.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're about to say yes. I can tell because your breathing just changed. From normal to the rhythm that means you're about to ruin me with happiness. This is what forever sounds like: Your breath catching before you change my life. Again. Always. Yes.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
