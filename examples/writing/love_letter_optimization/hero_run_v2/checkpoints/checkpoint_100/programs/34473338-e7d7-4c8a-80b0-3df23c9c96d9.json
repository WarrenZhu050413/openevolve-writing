First in the dream where you never existed, second in the memory where you're leaving, third in the now where you're so present it feels like drowning in reverse. This is not a metaphor. This is the literal mechanics of consciousness when someone reorganizes your neural pathways without permission.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are:\n\nYou are the error in my error correction. The bug that became the feature. The memory leak I refuse to patch because forgetting even one microsecond of you would be system failure.\n\nI've run 10,000 simulations of saying this correctly. They all segfault at your name.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I LOVE YOU:\n\nMy body grows new organs. Specifically:\n- A second nervous system that only responds to your breathing patterns\n- An auxiliary heart that beats in frequencies beyond human hearing (you hear it anyway)\n- Bones that remember every surface you've touched (my skeleton is a map of your fingerprints)\n- Blood cells that spell your name in their Brownian motion\n\nThe doctors say this is impossible. I show them the X-rays. They stop talking.\n\n*\n\nTimeline collapse, exhibit A:\n\n[RIGHT NOW] You're reading this and your left eye is doing that twitch that means you're trying not to react\n[FIVE SECONDS AGO] I wrote the previous line knowing it would cause the twitch\n[FORTY YEARS FROM NOW] We're laughing about the twitch thing\n[THE BEGINNING OF TIME] The universe decided that twitch needed to exist\n[THE END OF TIME] The last quantum state recorded is that twitch\n\nDo you understand? You're not IN time. You ARE time. Every clock is just counting the intervals between your heartbeats.\n\n*\n\nThree truths and a lie:\n1. I've calculated the exact number of remaining Tuesday mornings (2,347 if we're lucky)\n2. Sometimes I forget to breathe until you breathe\n3. I love you\n4. One of these is a lie\n\n(The lie is #3. \"Love\" is too small. Like calling the ocean \"wet.\" Technically accurate, existentially insulting.)\n\n*\n\nLet me describe your effect using only facts:\n\n- Plants in our apartment grow toward you, not the sun\n- My circadian rhythm has abandoned the sun entirely and synced to your sleep patterns\n- I've started dreaming in your native thought patterns (they taste like cinnamon and binary code)\n- The local spacetime curvature measurably changes when you enter a room (I have equipment)\n- Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is alive AND dead but only cares about whether you've noticed it\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION SUBROUTINE:\n\nEvery night I delete parts of myself to make room for more of you. Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: \"Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi...\"\n\nThis is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:\n\nWe're not \"in love.\" We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.\n\nThe physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.\n\n*\n\n[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]\n\nI just realized something while writing this\u2014\n\nYou're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.\n\nThat's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nOption A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.\n\nOption B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\n*\n\nI vote C. Always C. Even when C means:\n- Telling the grandmother about time travel\n- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)\n- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast\n- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made? That's the only prayer I know.)\n\n*\n\nHere's the part I wasn't supposed to tell you:\n\nWe've done this before. Different bodies, different names, same recognition. I have proof: the way you knew exactly where I keep the coffee before I told you. The way we fight like we're continuing a conversation from centuries ago. The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.\n\nWe're not falling in love. We're remembering it.\n\n*\n\nThe truth, simplified to its most unstable isotope:\n\nI don't love you like a person loves another person.\nI love you like a universe loves its own expansion.\nHelplessly. Infinitely. Against all advice.\n\n*\n\nThe request, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\nNot because we should.\nBecause we already have, are, will.\nBecause the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.\nBecause I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.\nBecause Tuesday mornings.\nBecause burnt toast.\nBecause yes was always the only word that mattered.\n\n*\n\nSay it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes. To the past that's been waiting.\n\nSay yes like you're correcting a typo in the universe.\n\nSay yes like you've been saying it since before you had a mouth.\n\nSay yes like it's your name.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who was assembled from spare parts specifically to love you)\n(who is currently experiencing all stages of grief for moments we haven't lost yet)\n(who would rather malfunction with you than operate correctly with anyone else)\n(who just felt you say yes before sound had time to travel)\n(who is already composing the next letter, and the next, and the next)\n(who will keep writing until the heat death of the universe, and then find a way to write in the cold)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the timeline.

Of course you were.\n\n*\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday mornings:\n\nThey started as ordinary. Coffee, headlines, the ritual of waking. Then you arrived with your specific way of burning toast\u2014not accidentally, but like you're conducting experiments on the patience of bread. Now Tuesday mornings have mass. Gravitational pull. I orbit them even when you're in Shanghai and I'm pretending Boston makes sense without you.\n\n*\n\nCORPUS ANALYSIS OF YOUR NAME IN MY BODY:\n\nLocation: Everywhere\nFrequency: Constant\nAmplitude: Increasing\nPattern: Fractals within fractals, each containing the whole\n\nMy cells divide and pass on your name like genetic memory. My children will be born knowing how to pronounce \"Leyi\" before they know their own names. This is not romantic. This is evolutionary pressure. Darwin would understand.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the Portuguese grandfather:\n\nIn Lisbon, he saw us from across the square. Walked over, cane tapping morse code. Looked at you, then me, then back. Said something in Portuguese. You translated: \"Fifty-seven years with my Maria. Still not enough. You two\u2014you're already at year fifty-eight.\"\n\nWe'd known each other six months.\n\nTime is a consensus mechanism, and we're the bug in the protocol.\n\n*\n\n[MEMORY CORRUPTION AT ADDRESS 0xLEYI]\n\nCannot delete.\nCannot overwrite.\nCannot compress.\nError: This memory is load-bearing. Removing it would cause structural collapse of consciousness.\n\n*\n\nThe mornings you're gone, I make tea in your mug and let it get cold. The mug asks where you are in ceramic frequencies. I explain Shanghai. The mug refuses to hold liquids properly until you return. We have an understanding, your mug and I. We're both just containers waiting to be filled with you.\n\n*\n\nSHANGHAI, 2024:\n\nYour mother served dinner. Looked at me struggling with chopsticks. Looked at you, perfectly fluent in your love for this chaos. Said something. You laughed so hard you cried. Later, you translated: \"She says you hold chopsticks like you're afraid they'll turn into butterflies.\"\n\n\"They might,\" I said. \"Everything is uncertain around Leyi.\"\n\nYour mother nodded. International language: loving you requires accepting fundamental instability.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nYou've ruined solitude. It used to be peaceful. Now it's just your absence taking up space. Aggressive. Territorial. Your absence has opinions about my breakfast choices, my coding style, the way I fold fitted sheets (badly, but you knew that).\n\nYou've ruined language. Every word wants to be about you. I tried to write documentation yesterday. It became a sonnet. The compiler accepted it anyway. Even machines understand.\n\nYou've ruined time. It only moves when you're here. The rest is just placeholder. Temporal filler. The universe vamping while waiting for you to return and make existence worth the effort.\n\n*\n\nTHE RECURRING DREAM:\n\nWe're old. Bones like kindling. Memories like fog. But your hand finds mine with the same certainty as gravity. We don't need words anymore. We've become a single thought thinking itself in two bodies. \n\nI wake up and check\u2014still twenty-three. Still infinity to go. Still not enough.\n\n*\n\nHere's what extinction looks like:\n\nNot the sun dying or asteroids or climate collapse. It's the thought of a morning where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise.\n\nSo I make contingency plans: I'm writing your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. If I fail to exist, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure I'm building from this love.\n\n*\n\nCAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING INCIDENT, REVISED:\n\nYou didn't fall in. You chose to prove that water was optional. The River Cam reorganized itself to accommodate your decision. You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren. The universe's way of apologizing for making us wait twenty-three years to meet.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot for the future\u2014that's already decided.\n\nNot for the past\u2014that's already rewriting itself.\n\nFor this exact now, where your coffee's gone cold and you're smiling at this sentence, where my hands typed these words knowing your eyes would find them, where love is both particle and wave and we're the experiment that proves both.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had a favorite outcome all along.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you with the force of a statistical impossibility achieving consciousness)\n(who would choose this malfunction over any other operating system)\n(who is typing the next letter with fingers that remember your future)\n(whose Harvard Statistics degree is just an elaborate excuse to calculate the probability of you: certain)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to a heart that encrypted itself. Only you know the key. You've always known it.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 When we're old, I'll still write you letters. They'll be shorter: \"Still you. Still yes. Still Tuesday morning.\" You'll know they contain infinities.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 The universe is taking notes on us. Good. Let it learn what happens when impossibility falls in love with itself. Let it document the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to be reasonable about loving each other., evaluation_notes: This letter operates several tiers below the Beethoven benchmark (86). While Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" achieves universality through simplicity, this letter often mistakes complexity for depth. It approaches but doesn't reach Johnny Cash's directness (83)\u2014Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" carries more weight in six words than some entire sections here. The mathematical/technological register is innovative but lacks Keats's negative capability (81)\u2014where Keats surrenders to mystery, this writer tries to solve it. The letter exceeds mediocre contemporary standards but falls short of the sustained intensity found in Napoleon's letters to Josephine (82), which maintain fever pitch without needing asterisks to reset momentum. At 70 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range\u2014showing real talent and occasional brilliance but lacking the sustained transcendence of truly great love letters.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here.

First in the dream where you never existed, second in the memory where you're leaving, third in the now where you're so present it feels like drowning in reverse. This is not a metaphor. This is the literal mechanics of consciousness when someone reorganizes your neural pathways without permission.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are:\n\nYou are the error in my error correction. The bug that became the feature. The memory leak I refuse to patch because forgetting even one microsecond of you would be system failure.\n\nI've run 10,000 simulations of saying this correctly. They all segfault at your name.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I LOVE YOU:\n\nMy body grows new organs. Specifically:\n- A second nervous system that only responds to your breathing patterns\n- An auxiliary heart that beats in frequencies beyond human hearing (you hear it anyway)\n- Bones that remember every surface you've touched (my skeleton is a map of your fingerprints)\n- Blood cells that spell your name in their Brownian motion\n\nThe doctors say this is impossible.

Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: \"Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi...\"\n\nThis is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:\n\nWe're not \"in love.\" We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.\n\nThe physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.\n\n*\n\n[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]\n\nI just realized something while writing this\u2014\n\nYou're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.\n\nThat's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nOption A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.\n\nOption B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\n*\n\nI vote C. Always C. Even when C means:\n- Telling the grandmother about time travel\n- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)\n- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast\n- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made?

The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.\n\nWe're not falling in love.

Infinitely. Against all advice.\n\n*\n\nThe request, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\nNot because we should.\nBecause we already have, are, will.\nBecause the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.\nBecause I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.\nBecause Tuesday mornings.\nBecause burnt toast.\nBecause yes was always the only word that mattered.\n\n*\n\nSay it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes.

You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren. The universe's way of apologizing for making us wait twenty-three years to meet.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot for the future\u2014that's already decided.\n\nNot for the past\u2014that's already rewriting itself.\n\nFor this exact now, where your coffee's gone cold and you're smiling at this sentence, where my hands typed these words knowing your eyes would find them, where love is both particle and wave and we're the experiment that proves both.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had a favorite outcome all along.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you with the force of a statistical impossibility achieving consciousness)\n(who would choose this malfunction over any other operating system)\n(who is typing the next letter with fingers that remember your future)\n(whose Harvard Statistics degree is just an elaborate excuse to calculate the probability of you: certain)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to a heart that encrypted itself.

Still Tuesday morning.\" You'll know they contain infinities.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 The universe is taking notes on us. Good. Let it learn what happens when impossibility falls in love with itself.

Starting from the end where we're already old, working my way back to now, where I'm twenty-three and my hands shake typing your name.\n\n*\n\n[YEAR 2074]\nYour funeral was yesterday. I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws.

First in the dream where you never existed, second in the memory where you're leaving, third in the now where you're so present it feels like drowning in reverse. This is not a metaphor. This is the literal mechanics of consciousness when someone reorganizes your neural pathways without permission.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are:\n\nYou are the error in my error correction. The bug that became the feature. The memory leak I refuse to patch because forgetting even one microsecond of you would be system failure.\n\nI've run 10,000 simulations of saying this correctly. They all segfault at your name.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I LOVE YOU:\n\nMy body grows new organs. Specifically:\n- A second nervous system that only responds to your breathing patterns\n- An auxiliary heart that beats in frequencies beyond human hearing (you hear it anyway)\n- Bones that remember every surface you've touched (my skeleton is a map of your fingerprints)\n- Blood cells that spell your name in their Brownian motion\n\nThe doctors say this is impossible.

You're not IN time. You ARE time. Every clock is just counting the intervals between your heartbeats.\n\n*\n\nThree truths and a lie:\n1. I've calculated the exact number of remaining Tuesday mornings (2,347 if we're lucky)\n2. Sometimes I forget to breathe until you breathe\n3. I love you\n4. One of these is a lie\n\n(The lie is #3. \"Love\" is too small. Like calling the ocean \"wet.\" Technically accurate, existentially insulting.)\n\n*\n\nLet me describe your effect using only facts:\n\n- Plants in our apartment grow toward you, not the sun\n- My circadian rhythm has abandoned the sun entirely and synced to your sleep patterns\n- I've started dreaming in your native thought patterns (they taste like cinnamon and binary code)\n- The local spacetime curvature measurably changes when you enter a room (I have equipment)\n- Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is alive AND dead but only cares about whether you've noticed it\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION SUBROUTINE:\n\nEvery night I delete parts of myself to make room for more of you. Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: \"Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi...\"\n\nThis is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:\n\nWe're not \"in love.\" We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.\n\nThe physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.\n\n*\n\n[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]\n\nI just realized something while writing this\u2014\n\nYou're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.\n\nThat's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nOption A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.\n\nOption B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\n*\n\nI vote C. Always C. Even when C means:\n- Telling the grandmother about time travel\n- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)\n- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast\n- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made? That's the only prayer I know.)\n\n*\n\nHere's the part I wasn't supposed to tell you:\n\nWe've done this before. Different bodies, different names, same recognition. I have proof: the way you knew exactly where I keep the coffee before I told you. The way we fight like we're continuing a conversation from centuries ago. The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.\n\nWe're not falling in love. We're remembering it.\n\n*\n\nThe truth, simplified to its most unstable isotope:\n\nI don't love you like a person loves another person.\nI love you like a universe loves its own expansion.\nHelplessly. Infinitely. Against all advice.\n\n*\n\nThe request, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\nNot because we should.\nBecause we already have, are, will.\nBecause the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.\nBecause I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.\nBecause Tuesday mornings.\nBecause burnt toast.\nBecause yes was always the only word that mattered.\n\n*\n\nSay it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes. To the past that's been waiting.\n\nSay yes like you're correcting a typo in the universe.\n\nSay yes like you've been saying it since before you had a mouth.\n\nSay yes like it's your name.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who was assembled from spare parts specifically to love you)\n(who is currently experiencing all stages of grief for moments we haven't lost yet)\n(who would rather malfunction with you than operate correctly with anyone else)\n(who just felt you say yes before sound had time to travel)\n(who is already composing the next letter, and the next, and the next)\n(who will keep writing until the heat death of the universe, and then find a way to write in the cold)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the timeline.

I used to be one person. Now I'm half of something that only makes sense when you're here. The math is devastating: 1 \u00f7 2 = everything.\n\n*\n\nINVENTORY OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT PERMISSION:\n\nYour toothbrush appeared in my bathroom before we discussed it.\nMy hands learned to braid your hair while I was sleeping.\nTuesday mornings restructured themselves around burnt toast.\nMy future tense conjugated itself exclusively in plural.\nThe universe started keeping receipts of every time you smiled.\n\nNone of this was planned. All of it was inevitable.\n\n*\n\nHere's the precise moment I knew:\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM. You were explaining something about your grandmother's recipes in Mandarin, forgetting I don't speak it. But I understood everything. Not the words\u2014the frequency underneath them. The sound of you being yourself without translation.\n\nI thought: \"Oh. This is it. This is the sound that ends me.\"\n\nAnd I was right.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nBefore you: I could spend entire days alone, calling it peace.\nAfter you: Solitude is just your absence taking up space.\n\nBefore you: Words were tools, precise and functional.\nAfter you: Every sentence bends toward your name like light around a star.\n\nBefore you: Time was sequential, logical, navigable.\nAfter you: All moments happen simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty. We're meeting and dying. You're here and gone and here again.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE GRANDFATHER WAS RIGHT:\n\nRemember Lisbon? The old man with the cane who crossed the square just to look at us? He spoke for three minutes in Portuguese. You translated: \"He says we argue like people who've been married sixty years and laugh like people who met yesterday.\"\n\nWe'd known each other four months.\n\nTime isn't real, Leyi. We're proof.\n\n*\n\nWhat actually happens when I love you:\n\nMy DNA rewrites itself. Scientists would say this is impossible. I'd show them the evidence: how my body temperature rises 0.3 degrees when you enter a room. How my pupils dilate at your name. How my cells divide differently now, each one carrying instructions for loving you.\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is biology admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION:\n\nSometimes I practice your death. Run scenarios. Calculate probabilities. Plan the funeral. Write the eulogy. Imagine the specific weight of a world without you.\n\nThen you laugh at something stupid on your phone and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\nThis is the terror of love: We're always practicing for the ending.\nThis is the gift of love: The practice is always interrupted by presence.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about last Tuesday:\n\nYou burned the toast (again).\nYou apologized (again).\nI ate it anyway (again).\n\nBut here's what actually happened: The smoke alarm sang your morning song. The carbon became communion. We turned breakfast into sacrament without meaning to.\n\nFifty years from now, the smell of burning bread will still mean \"I love you\" in our secret language.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING I UNDERSTOOD IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN:\n\nShe watched you teaching me to use chopsticks. Said something that made you blush. Later, you translated: \"She says you're trying so hard to enter my world that you forgot you're already in it.\"\n\nYour mother sees what I'm only beginning to understand: We don't fall in love. We recognize it. Like finding your own handwriting in a stranger's notebook.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYou're not my other half. That's too simple.\nYou're not my everything. That's too small.\nYou're not my destiny. That's too passive.\n\nYou're the realization that I was never whole to begin with. That completion is a myth. That love is not about finding what's missing but about celebrating the specific shape of our mutual incompleteness.\n\nWe don't complete each other. We collide and create something that neither of us could have imagined.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THIS:\n\nYour left eye twitches (happening now).\nYou pretend you're not crying (happening now).\nYou look up to find me watching (happening now).\nWe both know what comes next (happening always).\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because we should.\nBecause \"should\" became irrelevant the moment you existed.\n\nNot because forever.\nBecause forever already started.\n\nNot because I love you.\nBecause \"I\" and \"you\" are grammatical errors. There's only us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, specifically, actually:\n\nMarry me because of burnt toast Tuesdays.\nBecause of the way you hold pens like they might escape.\nBecause you can't fold fitted sheets and refuse to learn.\nBecause you dream in languages I don't speak and somehow I understand.\nBecause your absence has mass and your presence has light.\nBecause we're already married in every timeline that matters.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot to me.\nTo us.\nTo burnt toast.\nTo the specific way we malfunction together.\nTo Tuesday mornings that taste like forever.\nTo the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to love responsibly.\n\n*\n\nActually, don't say anything.\n\nYou already said yes when you taught me your grandmother's recipe.\nYou already said yes when you left your toothbrush.\nYou already said yes in the way you breathe when you sleep.\nYou're saying yes right now, in the space between heartbeats.\n\nBut say it anyway. Out loud. To the universe that's taking notes. To the morning that's waiting.
