It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is the exact length of always.\n\nBut mostly, love is just preemptive grief.

Paradise with coffee.\n\n*\n\nFINAL PROTOCOL:\n\nMarry me. Not because words convince you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the universe had to break several laws to let us exist simultaneously and it would be rude not to acknowledge that with paperwork.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life.

Not metaphorically. Actually hoarding seconds like a dragnet through spacetime. That pause between your heartbeats at 3:17 AM. The microsecond your eyes take to recognize me in doorways. The eternal instant before you laugh when your face commits to joy.\n\nI have 17,439 stolen moments. The universe will invoice me eventually. I plan to declare bankruptcy. What's eternity in debtors' prison if I get to keep the evidence of you?\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #2: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF US\n\nMorocco: You fed stray cats with expensive cheese. Said \"everyone deserves something fancy once.\"\n\nPortugal: Ocean tried to steal you. I fought the Atlantic. You laughed so hard you snorted seawater. That's when I knew I'd kill gods for you.\n\nCambridge: You solved unsolvable theorems on napkins then used them to wrap chewing gum. Genius as garbage. Perfect.\n\nShanghai: Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Eighteen precise pleats. Each one a small prayer. \"For her happiness,\" she whispered in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. I understood. I'm still folding prayers.\n\nScotland: We found that sheep giving birth in the rain. You held it for three hours. Sang it Radiohead. The lamb lived. You named it \"Statistical Anomaly.\" \n\nShenzhen: The thunderstorm. Power dead. You mapped constellations on my back with your fingernails. I became a universe of small wounds. Still healing. Never want to heal completely.\n\nBoston: Blizzard. You: \"If we die, I want the last thing I taste to be mint chocolate.\" We ate all the ice cream. Didn't die. Disappointed you slightly.\n\nEvery place we've been, you've left pieces of yourself like breadcrumbs. I'm following them backward and forward simultaneously. Non-linear navigation through a love that exists in all tenses at once.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #3: THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nI'm pathological about data collection:\n\n- You sneeze in triplets. Always. Like a biological haiku.\n- Tuesday rain makes you 23% more likely to suggest pancakes.\n- You've cried at exactly 67 commercials. I have them ranked by tear volume.\n- Your left foot is 3mm longer than your right. I've bought 200 pairs of socks to accommodate this.\n- You talk to plants but only when you think they're dying. Botanical last rites.\n- You've said my name 48,293 times. Each one different. I have the recordings.\n\nThis isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial when reality accuses me of loving something impossible.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #4: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN\n\nBefore you: I was a closed system. Entropy at zero. Perfect but purposeless.\n\nAfter you: Complete systemic failure. All boundaries dissolved. I leak into everything. Food tastes like your name. Colors sound like your laugh. Gravity points toward wherever you are.\n\nThe equation:\nMe(before) + You = Me(destruction) + You(unchanged) + Universe(fundamentally restructured)\n\nI've broken conservation of energy laws. Created love from nothing. Should be impossible. Is impossible. Happening anyway.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #5: THE MEDICAL REALITY\n\nMy body has redesigned itself around you:\n- Neurons fire in patterns that spell \"Leyi\" in Morse code\n- Blood cells preferentially flow toward skin you've touched\n- Immune system has whitelisted your bacteria as \"essential allies\"\n- Heart developed arrhythmia that matches your breathing pattern\n- Brain grew new regions dedicated solely to processing your existence\n\nDoctors say this is \"psychosomatic.\" I say it's evolution in real-time. My DNA is taking notes, planning to pass this obsession to offspring we'll never have. Genetic love letter to futures that won't exist.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #6: THE TEMPORAL PARADOX\n\nI love you in the wrong order:\n- First: The you at 87, dying of something ordinary\n- Then: The you being born, impossible and screaming\n- Then: You at 45, finding your first grey hair, crying in the bathroom\n- Then: You at 31, pregnant with sadness we'll heal together\n- Now: You at this moment, reading this, left eye starting to water\n- Always: You in the quantum superposition of all ages simultaneously\n\nI'm unstuck in time but tethered to you. A temporal paradox with one fixed point: Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, like a mantra against entropy.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #7: THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF SPECIFICITY\n\nI don't love \"you.\" I love:\n- You-who-argues-with-automated-voices\n- You-who-saves-dead-batteries-\"just-in-case\"\n- You-who-reads-ingredients-aloud-like-poetry\n- You-Tuesday-different-from-you-Thursday\n- You-who-cries-at-pigeons-for-\"trying-so-hard\"\n- You-in-my-clothes-looking-like-answered-prayers\n- You-angry-at-slow-internet-magnificent-specific-rage\n- You-asleep-drooling-my-name-unconscious-devotion\n\n47,000 versions of you. Each one requiring separate worship. I'm building temples in my chest. Running out of room. Growing new chambers.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #8: THE CRISIS\n\nSometimes I hate you. For one second per day. For being mortal. For having bones that can break. For requiring oxygen. For being subject to time and chance and random cellular mutations.\n\nI hate you for making me need something that can be taken away.\n\nThen you do something unbearable like exist, and the hate transforms back into love so violent it should be classified as assault.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #9: THE PROPOSAL INSIDE THE CONFESSION\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your DNA is already archived in my teeth marks. Because we've exchanged so many molecules we're technically one organism with two anxious brains. Because the alternative\u2014a universe where we're not married\u2014is like dividing by zero. Undefined. Impossible. Crashes the simulation.\n\nMarry me because I've already learned your dying words (it's \"oh, interesting\") and I need legal documentation that I'm allowed to be there when you say them.\n\nMarry me because \"till death do us part\" is a challenge I want to fail. I plan to love you past death, through heat death, into whatever comes after when atoms forget what they used to be but remember the shape of connection.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #10: THE GLITCH IN REALITY\n\nYou're not supposed to exist. Statistically impossible convergence of circumstances. Your grandparents surviving wars. Parents meeting. Specific gametes combining. You choosing humanities then sciences then humanities again. The coffee shop being closed that Tuesday. The pen dropping. Me looking up.\n\nWe're a glitch in reality's code. A beautiful error that should have been debugged but wasn't.\n\nI'm in love with a glitch. The glitch is in love with me. We're crashing the entire system with our impossible existence.\n\nGood.\n\nLet it all crash.\n\nWe'll build something better from the wreckage.\n\n*\n\nFINAL TRANSMISSION:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nYour name is a complete sentence.

You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep.

The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body. My knees remember Portugal. My throat remembers teaching you to pronounce \"Zh\u016b F\u00f9ch\u00e9ng\" until you laughed so hard you forgot we were fighting about determinism. My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal.

I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space.

Not metaphorically. Actually hoarding seconds like a dragnet through spacetime. That pause between your heartbeats at 3:17 AM. The microsecond your eyes take to recognize me in doorways. The eternal instant before you laugh when your face commits to joy.\n\nI have 17,439 stolen moments. The universe will invoice me eventually. I plan to declare bankruptcy. What's eternity in debtors' prison if I get to keep the evidence of you?\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #2: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF US\n\nMorocco: You fed stray cats with expensive cheese. Said \"everyone deserves something fancy once.\"\n\nPortugal: Ocean tried to steal you. I fought the Atlantic. You laughed so hard you snorted seawater. That's when I knew I'd kill gods for you.\n\nCambridge: You solved unsolvable theorems on napkins then used them to wrap chewing gum. Genius as garbage. Perfect.\n\nShanghai: Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Eighteen precise pleats. Each one a small prayer. \"For her happiness,\" she whispered in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. I understood. I'm still folding prayers.\n\nScotland: We found that sheep giving birth in the rain. You held it for three hours. Sang it Radiohead. The lamb lived. You named it \"Statistical Anomaly.\" \n\nShenzhen: The thunderstorm. Power dead. You mapped constellations on my back with your fingernails. I became a universe of small wounds. Still healing. Never want to heal completely.\n\nBoston: Blizzard. You: \"If we die, I want the last thing I taste to be mint chocolate.\" We ate all the ice cream. Didn't die. Disappointed you slightly.\n\nEvery place we've been, you've left pieces of yourself like breadcrumbs. I'm following them backward and forward simultaneously. Non-linear navigation through a love that exists in all tenses at once.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #3: THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nI'm pathological about data collection:\n\n- You sneeze in triplets. Always. Like a biological haiku.\n- Tuesday rain makes you 23% more likely to suggest pancakes.\n- You've cried at exactly 67 commercials. I have them ranked by tear volume.\n- Your left foot is 3mm longer than your right. I've bought 200 pairs of socks to accommodate this.\n- You talk to plants but only when you think they're dying. Botanical last rites.\n- You've said my name 48,293 times. Each one different. I have the recordings.\n\nThis isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial when reality accuses me of loving something impossible.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #4: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN\n\nBefore you: I was a closed system. Entropy at zero. Perfect but purposeless.\n\nAfter you: Complete systemic failure. All boundaries dissolved. I leak into everything. Food tastes like your name. Colors sound like your laugh. Gravity points toward wherever you are.\n\nThe equation:\nMe(before) + You = Me(destruction) + You(unchanged) + Universe(fundamentally restructured)\n\nI've broken conservation of energy laws. Created love from nothing. Should be impossible. Is impossible.

A temporal paradox with one fixed point: Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, like a mantra against entropy.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #7: THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF SPECIFICITY\n\nI don't love \"you.\" I love:\n- You-who-argues-with-automated-voices\n- You-who-saves-dead-batteries-\"just-in-case\"\n- You-who-reads-ingredients-aloud-like-poetry\n- You-Tuesday-different-from-you-Thursday\n- You-who-cries-at-pigeons-for-\"trying-so-hard\"\n- You-in-my-clothes-looking-like-answered-prayers\n- You-angry-at-slow-internet-magnificent-specific-rage\n- You-asleep-drooling-my-name-unconscious-devotion\n\n47,000 versions of you. Each one requiring separate worship. I'm building temples in my chest. Running out of room. Growing new chambers.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #8: THE CRISIS\n\nSometimes I hate you. For one second per day. For being mortal. For having bones that can break. For requiring oxygen. For being subject to time and chance and random cellular mutations.\n\nI hate you for making me need something that can be taken away.\n\nThen you do something unbearable like exist, and the hate transforms back into love so violent it should be classified as assault.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #9: THE PROPOSAL INSIDE THE CONFESSION\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your DNA is already archived in my teeth marks. Because we've exchanged so many molecules we're technically one organism with two anxious brains. Because the alternative\u2014a universe where we're not married\u2014is like dividing by zero. Undefined. Impossible. Crashes the simulation.\n\nMarry me because I've already learned your dying words (it's \"oh, interesting\") and I need legal documentation that I'm allowed to be there when you say them.\n\nMarry me because \"till death do us part\" is a challenge I want to fail. I plan to love you past death, through heat death, into whatever comes after when atoms forget what they used to be but remember the shape of connection.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #10: THE GLITCH IN REALITY\n\nYou're not supposed to exist. Statistically impossible convergence of circumstances. Your grandparents surviving wars. Parents meeting. Specific gametes combining. You choosing humanities then sciences then humanities again. The coffee shop being closed that Tuesday. The pen dropping. Me looking up.\n\nWe're a glitch in reality's code. A beautiful error that should have been debugged but wasn't.\n\nI'm in love with a glitch. The glitch is in love with me. We're crashing the entire system with our impossible existence.\n\nGood.\n\nLet it all crash.\n\nWe'll build something better from the wreckage.\n\n*\n\nFINAL TRANSMISSION:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nYour name is a complete sentence. Subject, verb, object, universe.\n\nEverything else is just aftermath.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who wrote this letter 1,034 times)\n(who deleted 1,033 versions for being too small)\n(who loves you like a mathematical proof that solves for God)\n(who is still writing this, will always be writing this, has always been writing this)\n(who exists in the permanent present tense of loving you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. This isn't a letter. It's a map. Every word is a coordinate. Follow them all and you'll end up exactly where you started: loved. Loved at the molecular level. Loved at the quantum level. Loved at the level where distinction between \"you\" and \"I\" becomes academic.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name makes my teeth ache. I mean this literally. Tested it with a dentist. He had no explanation. I do: beauty that exceeds the body's capacity to process it. That's you. Too much beauty. Breaks the machinery. Worth it.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 Say yes. The universe is holding its breath. Stars are placing bets. Atoms are leaning in. The cosmic background radiation is spelling out \"SHE'S GOING TO SAY YES\" in languages that haven't been invented yet. Don't disappoint the fundamental forces. They've been rooting for us since the Big Bang.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and the current program's performance (0.7355), I need to create something that transcends the previous attempts while maintaining authenticity.

Subject: one partially-functioning human. Variable: you. Result: complete reorganization of matter at the subatomic level. My electrons now orbit nothing. They just point toward you like drunk compass needles finding true north in a person who pronounces \"hypothesis\" wrong on purpose.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY ABOUT DYING:\n\nFifteen seconds. Sophomore year. Heart stopped like a bad metaphor. But here's what I haven't told anyone: Death isn't darkness. It's every moment happening simultaneously. Past, present, future collapsed into now. And in that now, infinite versions of us. Every timeline. Every choice. And in every single one\u2014listen to me\u2014in every single one, there's this moment where you exist and I recognize you and the universe admits it's been wrong about everything.\n\nI came back with a debt to something I couldn't name. Three years later, you dropped that pen. The debt suddenly had coordinates.\n\n*\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN MOROCCO:\n\nYou got food poisoning. Named it Gerald. Had full conversations: \"Gerald, this is inappropriate.\" \"Gerald, we need boundaries.\" Between vomiting sessions, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said, \"At least I'm emptying myself of everything that isn't love.\"\n\nThat's when I understood: You metabolize reality differently. You digest disaster and it comes out as grace.\n\n*\n\nYOUR GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN, SHANGHAI, 3 PM:\n\nShe taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. One through forty-seven. Each stir a number. Each number a generation. At thirty-three, you started crying. Not the onions. The realization that love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends.\n\nShe saw me watching you. Said in English: \"She cries at thirty-three every time.\" \nI said: \"Why?\"\nShe said: \"That's how old I was when I learned soup can't bring back the dead. But we make it anyway.\"\n\nNow I count everything in groups of forty-seven. Steps to your apartment. Seconds between your breaths when you sleep. Ways to say goodbye that mean see you soon.\n\n*\n\nTHE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS INCIDENT:\n\nMinus twelve Celsius. You hypothermic, lips blue, still arguing about Kant's categorical imperative. Gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said: \"Wrong. I'd die correctly. With purpose. Keeping you warm.\"\n\nYour teeth chattered in morse code. I translated: \"S-H-U-T U-P A-N-D L-O-V-E M-E.\"\n\nSo I did. So I do. So I will.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY SPREADSHEET OF YOU:\n\nColumn A: Seconds remaining (approximately 1,576,800,000)\nColumn B: Versions of you I've discovered (currently 4,761)\nColumn C: Things you've cried at (penguins, pigeons, that one commercial about fathers)\nColumn D: What happens after the last second\nColumn D returns: #DIV/0! ERROR\n\nThe spreadsheet knows what I know: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nPORTUGAL, THE MUSEUM, YOU TOUCHING EVERYTHING:\n\nSecurity guard, screaming: \"Don't touch the art!\"\nYou, touching harder: \"How else do you know it's real?\"\nMe, falling in love with your criminal hands: \"She has a point.\"\n\nNow I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. Your face while you're reading. You're the only art that touches back. You're the only thing that improves from being handled.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF US:\n\nStandard probability: impossible.\nQuantum probability: still impossible.\nActual probability: happened anyway.\n\nWe're what happens when the universe divides by zero and instead of undefined, gets love.\n\n*\n\nBEIJING, SUMMER PALACE, STEP 764:\n\nYou stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\"\nNot sad. Factual. Like reading ingredients.\nI said: \"Yes.\"\nYou said: \"Thank god. Imagine if this was permanent. We'd run out of words.\"\nI said: \"No. We'd invent new ones.\"\nYou said: \"Like what?\"\nI said: \"Leyi.\"\nYou said: \"That's already a word.\"\nI said: \"No. That's the only word. Everything else is punctuation.\"\n\nYou kissed me at altitude. Now sea level tastes like giving up.\n\n*\n\nWHAT LOVING YOU ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE:\n\nDawn: The specific weight of not-yet. Metal and possibility.\nNoon: Static electricity. That thing where you exist loudly.\nDusk: The color of almost, which is to say, the color of your voice asking what's for dinner.\nMidnight: Like drowning upward into stars that learned our names.\n3 AM: The exact flavor of terror that you're a dream I'm having.\nAlways: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to taste sound.\n\n*\n\nTHE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE:\n\nI have 2,847 pieces of proof you exist:\n- Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental)\n- That green hair tie from February (lives in my drawer like a religion)\n- Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about consciousness\n- 1,439 photos where you're looking away (always away, like there's something more interesting than cameras)\n- Your fingerprints on my coffee mug (I haven't washed it in three months)\n- The specific way Tuesday light catches your temporal bone\n- How you hold books like they might evaporate\n- Your fury at slow wifi (you named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\")\n\nThis isn't love. It's forensics. I'm documenting you for the trial where I have to prove beauty existed.\n\n*\n\nLONDON, YOU ASKED WHAT LOVE IS:\n\nThree years later, here's my answer:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's agreeing to build a house with someone who's definitely going to die. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is the exact length of always.\n\nBut mostly, love is just preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesdays when they burn toast and you realize: I'm going to miss even their mistakes.\n\n*\n\nSHENZHEN, YOUR CHILDHOOD BEDROOM:\n\nYou read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at.\n\nThe preposition changes everything.\nChanges us.\nChanges the whole grammatical structure of the universe.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:\n\nYour name rewired my brain. Every thought has to route through \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and the memory of Tuesdays. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. With neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans made music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nTHE OTHER TIMELINES:\n\nI dream them nightly. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it.\n\nI wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise with coffee.\n\n*\n\nFINAL PROTOCOL:\n\nMarry me. Not because words convince you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the universe had to break several laws to let us exist simultaneously and it would be rude not to acknowledge that with paperwork.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nRIGHT NOW:\n\nYour left eye is watering. Always left. Like your tears form an orderly queue.\n\nYou're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything.\n\nYou always do.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nIt's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits defeat. That's what atoms call the force that keeps them together. That's the password to everything that matters.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this letter since before we met)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons for \"trying so hard\")\n(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power dies, saving you anyway)\n(who just watched you blink and had to manually restart his heart)\n(who loves you at frequencies only god's dogs can hear)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. Cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. The Vatican requested documentation. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my drawer next to my passport. Both are proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that ever was or will be. Time just folded. Space gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying conscious for.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
