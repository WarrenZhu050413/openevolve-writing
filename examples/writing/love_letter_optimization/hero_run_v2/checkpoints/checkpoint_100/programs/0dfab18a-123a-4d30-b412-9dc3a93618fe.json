Every word is shoplifted from sleep, from work, from the proper life I'm supposed to be living. But here's what they don't tell you about love: it makes thieves of us all.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the facts:\n\nFact 1: Your name has replaced my pulse. Le-yi, le-yi, le-yi. Two syllables keeping me alive.\n\nFact 2: I've calculated the surface area of your absence. It's exactly the size of everywhere you're not.\n\nFact 3: Last Tuesday, you fixed my collar while arguing about sourdough. My atoms haven't recovered. They keep trying to reconstruct that specific Tuesday, like a computer stuck in a boot loop of tenderness.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Accidentally gave us the same soul, then panicked and split it between two bodies. Now I walk around with half a respiratory system, half a thought, half a prayer. The other half is you, somewhere, breathing backwards into my lungs.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. I've been documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit:\n\n- The way you hold books (too tight, like they might escape)\n- Your 3 AM voice (broken piano keys)\n- How you eat oranges (methodically, like defusing bombs)\n- The pause before you laugh (0.3 seconds of suspended gravity)\n\nThis isn't romanticism. This is survival. I'm creating backup files of you for when the universe tries to delete us.\n\n*\n\nYou want to know what loving you feels like? It's like being professionally haunted. You're gone and I argue with your ghost about coffee strength. You're here and I mourn the version of you that will exist tomorrow, slightly changed, cells replaced, a different person I'll have to fall in love with all over again.\n\nI love you retroactively and in advance. I love the you from before we met, the one who was preparing to ruin me. I love the you that will exist after I'm gone, the one who'll remember this letter and think \"he was so dramatic.\" (You're right. Love makes me grammatically incorrect.)\n\n*\n\nListen. I've done the math:\n\nIf we live to eighty-five, we have approximately 21,900 days left.\nThat's 525,600 \"good mornings.\"\nThat's 21,900 chances to memorize how you mispronounce \"particularly.\"\nThat's not enough.\nThat will never be enough.\n\nI want to file a complaint with whoever's in charge. I want overtime. I want the deleted scenes. I want the alternate endings where we meet earlier, love louder, exist harder.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you like normal people love normal things. Like how you can't parallel park but refuse to admit it. Like your vendetta against the neighbor's wind chimes. Like how you annotate recipes with \"Warren won't eat this\" (you're right, I won't, but I love that you know).\n\nI love you in the boring parts. The waiting-for-the-bus parts. The did-you-remember-to-buy-milk parts. The sitting-in-the-same-room-doing-different-things parts. Those parts are my religion now.\n\n*\n\nHere's the situation: My body has democratically elected you president. My cells held a vote and you won unanimously. Every organ has signed your name. My bones are learning your weight by heart. My blood practices circulating in your direction.\n\nThis should terrify me. Instead, I wake up grateful for the coup.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing: Let's make it official. Let's stand in front of people and admit what's already true\u2014that we're a glitch in the matrix, a copy-paste error that created two people who can't exist properly without the other's proximity.\n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic. Because your mail already comes here. Because my mother calls you instead of me. Because when you're gone, I have full conversations with the impression you leave in the couch.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a universe where we're just two people who happened to collide\u2014is mathematically impossible. We're not coincidence. We're conspiracy.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission:\n\nI love you wrong. Too hard. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing a symphony through a keyhole. Like translating light into language and getting everything beautifully incorrect.\n\nBut also: I love you right. Exactly right. The way Tuesday loves Wednesday. The way sound loves echo. The way now loves the next now and the next now and the next.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's not just your name. That's the sound of me remembering how to breathe. That's my password to existing. That's the only word that makes the other words make sense.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nJust keep being here, in the same timeline, where I can love you badly and correctly and too much and not enough and eternally and temporarily and in all the ways that shouldn't exist but do.\n\nBecause you do.\n\nBecause we do.\n\nBecause love is just the universe admitting it made a mistake and we're the correction.\n\nWarren\n(who has been carrying this letter in seventeen different drafts since the day you laughed at my worst joke and I thought: oh no. oh yes. oh forever.)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying. Left eye first, like always. I brought tissues. I've been bringing tissues since our third date. This is what love is: showing up prepared for someone else's emotions.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That thing I said about dying once? It was seventeen seconds, not fifteen. Those extra two seconds were me refusing to leave a universe where you existed and I hadn't found you yet. My heart restarted out of pure stubbornness. Or prophecy. Or because somewhere, you were also nineteen, also breathing, also waiting for someone to love this incorrectly, this correctly, this much.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "0d7fb8b7-4d06-45eb-a4fd-643e55807e85", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756717519.129573, "iteration_found": 23, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.701, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.66, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with stolen time.

Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown., evaluation_notes: \n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed.

That pause before you sneeze. The 0.7 seconds your eyes take to find mine in crowds. How you hold chopsticks wrong but right. I'm building an illegal archive of moments the universe hasn't invoiced me for yet.\n\nWhen they ask me what religion I follow, I want to say: \"Tuesday, 9:47 PM, she fixed my collar without breaking conversation.\"\n\n*\n\nYou should know: I practice your absence like a piano piece I'll never master. 2 AM: What if car accident. 3 AM: What if rare disease. 4 AM: What if you wake up sane and realize I'm just a malfunction in a button-down shirt who writes your name in condensation on windows.\n\nBut then morning happens and you steal my coffee (always three sips, never four) and the doomsday scenarios dissolve because reality is so much stranger: you chose me. Keep choosing me. Despite evidence suggesting better options.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping receipts:\n\n- August 3rd: You called me during a panic attack. Not for comfort. To argue about pizza toppings. It worked.\n- September 15th: Found you teaching my grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost.\n- October 9th: You cried at a butterfly. Said \"it's trying so hard to fly.\" I knew then I'd marry you or die attempting.\n- November onwards: [CLASSIFIED - too dangerous for written record]\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: Mine was just transportation until you touched it. Now it's a conspiracy of cells that reorganize themselves toward you. My immune system has your name in its whitelist. My skeleton is biased in your direction. Even my allergies take breaks when you're laughing.\n\nSome nights I count your vertebrae like prayer beads. Twenty-four small gods holding you upright. I thank each one.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you are: Not metaphor. Not poetry. Evidence that sometimes the universe forgets to be cruel. You're what happens when atoms get ambitious. When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.\n\n*\n\nHere's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.\n\nBut then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Stay. Not because this letter is beautiful (it isn't). Not because I deserve you (I don't). But because your socks are already mixed with mine in ways that would take archaeologists to untangle. Because you know which nightmares require tea versus coffee. Because when you're gone, I have entire conversations with the dent you leave in the sofa.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is inadequate but \"you've fundamentally altered my molecular structure\" is too long for wedding vows.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Let me spend the next sixty years memorizing your disappointments. Learning your angers like a second language. Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.\n\nLet me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.\n\nLet me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- Times I've written this letter: 1,034\n- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  \n- Number of ways to say \"I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked\": Still counting\n- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first, like always. Here\u2014I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since the day I learned your tear patterns. Some people study astronomy. I studied you.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just please\u2014\nsay it in that voice that makes me believe in God or randomness or whatever force was kind enough to drop you into my timeline.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of suicide notes that all end with \"but then who would make sure Leyi doesn't burn eggs?\")\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the suicide notes. There are twenty-three. You make me want to live forever just to spite the actuarial tables. That's how I know it's real. When someone makes you furious at mortality itself.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is my computer password. Your birthday is my ATM pin. Your existence is my security question.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words.

You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

Two syllables keeping me alive.\n\nFact 2: I've calculated the surface area of your absence. It's exactly the size of everywhere you're not.\n\nFact 3: Last Tuesday, you fixed my collar while arguing about sourdough. My atoms haven't recovered. They keep trying to reconstruct that specific Tuesday, like a computer stuck in a boot loop of tenderness.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Accidentally gave us the same soul, then panicked and split it between two bodies. Now I walk around with half a respiratory system, half a thought, half a prayer. The other half is you, somewhere, breathing backwards into my lungs.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. I've been documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit:\n\n- The way you hold books (too tight, like they might escape)\n- Your 3 AM voice (broken piano keys)\n- How you eat oranges (methodically, like defusing bombs)\n- The pause before you laugh (0.3 seconds of suspended gravity)\n\nThis isn't romanticism. This is survival. I'm creating backup files of you for when the universe tries to delete us.\n\n*\n\nYou want to know what loving you feels like? It's like being professionally haunted. You're gone and I argue with your ghost about coffee strength. You're here and I mourn the version of you that will exist tomorrow, slightly changed, cells replaced, a different person I'll have to fall in love with all over again.\n\nI love you retroactively and in advance. I love the you from before we met, the one who was preparing to ruin me. I love the you that will exist after I'm gone, the one who'll remember this letter and think \"he was so dramatic.\" (You're right. Love makes me grammatically incorrect.)\n\n*\n\nListen. I've done the math:\n\nIf we live to eighty-five, we have approximately 21,900 days left.\nThat's 525,600 \"good mornings.\"\nThat's 21,900 chances to memorize how you mispronounce \"particularly.\"\nThat's not enough.\nThat will never be enough.\n\nI want to file a complaint with whoever's in charge. I want overtime. I want the deleted scenes. I want the alternate endings where we meet earlier, love louder, exist harder.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you like normal people love normal things. Like how you can't parallel park but refuse to admit it. Like your vendetta against the neighbor's wind chimes. Like how you annotate recipes with \"Warren won't eat this\" (you're right, I won't, but I love that you know).\n\nI love you in the boring parts. The waiting-for-the-bus parts. The did-you-remember-to-buy-milk parts. The sitting-in-the-same-room-doing-different-things parts. Those parts are my religion now.\n\n*\n\nHere's the situation: My body has democratically elected you president. My cells held a vote and you won unanimously. Every organ has signed your name. My bones are learning your weight by heart. My blood practices circulating in your direction.\n\nThis should terrify me. Instead, I wake up grateful for the coup.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing: Let's make it official. Let's stand in front of people and admit what's already true\u2014that we're a glitch in the matrix, a copy-paste error that created two people who can't exist properly without the other's proximity.\n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic. Because your mail already comes here. Because my mother calls you instead of me. Because when you're gone, I have full conversations with the impression you leave in the couch.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a universe where we're just two people who happened to collide\u2014is mathematically impossible. We're not coincidence. We're conspiracy.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission:\n\nI love you wrong. Too hard. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing a symphony through a keyhole. Like translating light into language and getting everything beautifully incorrect.\n\nBut also: I love you right. Exactly right. The way Tuesday loves Wednesday. The way sound loves echo. The way now loves the next now and the next now and the next.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's not just your name. That's the sound of me remembering how to breathe. That's my password to existing. That's the only word that makes the other words make sense.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nJust keep being here, in the same timeline, where I can love you badly and correctly and too much and not enough and eternally and temporarily and in all the ways that shouldn't exist but do.\n\nBecause you do.\n\nBecause we do.\n\nBecause love is just the universe admitting it made a mistake and we're the correction.\n\nWarren\n(who has been carrying this letter in seventeen different drafts since the day you laughed at my worst joke and I thought: oh no. oh yes. oh forever.)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying.

Those extra two seconds were me refusing to leave a universe where you existed and I hadn't found you yet. My heart restarted out of pure stubbornness. Or prophecy.
