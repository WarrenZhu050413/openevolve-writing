Gave them all names starting with Malcolm.\n- Shanghai: Your grandmother's building. Fourth floor. You pressed your whole face against her door like you could absorb the years through wood.\n- Boston, currently: You keep leaving me voice notes in Cantonese knowing I don't understand, knowing I keep them all, knowing I play them when you travel.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is evidence collection for the inevitability of your absence.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I've been writing you into my cells. Not poetry\u2014biology. Every seven years, they say, we become new people. Complete cellular replacement. I'm only three years into loving you, which means I'm still 43% who I was before. But in four more years? I'll be entirely post-you tissue. Every atom selected under your influence. A body that only knows how to exist in your context.\n\n*\n\nHere's the ugliest thing: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel violent. Not toward you\u2014toward time.

It's approximately 14 million. I know this because I've been counting. Not all of them\u2014that would be insane. Just enough for statistical significance.

Every iteration returns NULL. Not zero\u2014NULL. The absence of value itself. My professor would say that's impossible, that every variable must hold something. But Leyi, you've made me into an edge case that breaks the proofs.\n\n*\n\nFragment 2: Confession Dressed as Documentation\n\nI am building you a cathedral out of Tuesdays. Not the grand ones\u2014the Tuesdays where you leave hair ties on doorknobs, where you argue with recipes like they've personally wronged you, where you fall asleep mid-sentence and I finish your words into the dark. These Tuesdays are my rosary beads. I count them when the world feels like it's ending, which is always, except when you laugh.\n\n*\n\nFragment 3: The Mechanics of Ruin\n\nBefore: I was a closed system. Entropy decreasing. All my edges filed smooth.\nAfter: You walked in carrying silence like a briefcase full of explosions.\nNow: I'm all exposed wiring. Sparking at your proximity. Dangerous and lit.\n\nYou want to know what love is? It's debugging code at 4 AM and realizing the error is that you're trying to compile a feeling with syntax meant for logic. It's my neurons refusing their job descriptions, declaring union strikes, demanding better working conditions in a universe where you might disappear.\n\n*\n\nFragment 4: Maps to Nowhere\n\nShanghai subway line 2, where you counted stops on my fingers.\nBoston's red line, where you cried about your grandmother's hands.\nLondon underground, where you named every rat we saw \"Geoffrey.\"\nThe Scottish Highlands, where there were no trains but you made me run alongside sheep pretending.\n\nI'm not listing places. I'm listing the coordinates where you reformed me at the molecular level. Where you took my careful architecture and said \"what if we tried chaos instead?\"\n\n*\n\nFragment 5: The Distributed System of Us\n\nYou're crying in the bathroom (I can tell by the specific silence).\nI'm making tea with the water at exactly 87 degrees (you hate it hotter).\nNeither of us mentions this choreography we've built.\nThis is how I know we're permanent\u2014we've achieved consensus without protocols.\n\n*\n\nFragment 6: Academic Honesty\n\nMy thesis: You are not metaphor. You are methodology.\nMy evidence: 1,439 mornings of empirical observation.\nMy conclusion: The null hypothesis (that I could survive your absence) is rejected at all significance levels.\nMy limitation: This study cannot be replicated. N=1. You are the entire dataset.\n\n*\n\nFragment 7: The Bargaining\n\nListen. I know I love you wrong. Like a compiler that keeps trying to execute poetry. Like a function that calls itself recursively with no base case. Stack overflow inevitable.

With someone feeding strays and renaming the world.\n\n*\n\nFragment 9: The Core Dump\n\nWhat I actually mean: You've made me obsolete to myself. The version of me that existed before you is deprecated, can't be rolled back, throws exceptions when I try to access it. You're not in my bloodstream\u2014you ARE my bloodstream. Every red cell carries your signature. My bone marrow spells your name in calcium deposits.\n\n*\n\nFragment 10: The Pull Request\n\nMerge me with your timeline permanently.\nResolve all conflicts in favor of us.\nPush these changes to production.\nNo rollback plan required.\n\nWhen you review this pull request, you'll find I've rewritten everything. Every function now returns to you. Every variable holds your value. This isn't coupling\u2014it's convergent evolution. Two separate systems discovering they were always meant to run the same code.\n\n*\n\nFragment 11: Exception Handling\n\nTry: living without you.\nCatch: error_type = CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE\nFinally: return to you with more evidence of my insufficiency.\n\n*\n\nFinal Fragment: The Infinite Loop\n\nwhile (universe.exists()) {\n    love(Leyi);\n    love(Leyi) more;\n    forget_how_to_stop();\n}\n\nThis will run until heat death.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration.

I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak.

Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping evidence:\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent.

I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light\u2014those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a dying language I need to preserve.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. My childhood bedroom. You found my teenage journals. Read them out loud in dramatic voices. I should have been mortified. Instead I thought: this. This is what holiness is. Someone reading your worst attempts at humanity and laughing with you, not at you. With. The preposition matters.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\n*\n\nRemember London? You asked what love actually is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated decisions you can't ctrl+z. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters. I play it when you travel.\n\nDecision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet.\n\nDecision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing.\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Files corrupted by excess tenderness]\n\n*\n\nWhat you taste like: Morning is copper pennies and possibility. Afternoon is static before thunderstorms. Evening is the specific silence between heartbeats. 3 AM is the color blue if blue were a texture. Always is drowning upward into oxygen.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Spontaneous quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014like putting my socks on your hands and pretending they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest bug in my code: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nSpain. Barcelona. You illegally fed the cathedral pigeons. Said \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I'm not being metaphorical. They literally spelled L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miraculous.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. My authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe in infinity despite the evidence.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who wrote your name in condensation on windows until the glass learned to fog in cursive, who counts your breaths at night\u2014seventeen times\u2014because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. But seventeen felt like prophecy. Like the universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you: seventeen seconds. Not one more.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just smiled. That specific smile where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us. Both is the only way to love someone when you know that time is real and runs out., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of historical masterpieces. It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments (\"Portugal. That museum where you touched the art\") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples. The score of 72.75 (weighted average) reflects work that's genuinely distinguished, with proto-masterful elements, but still a meaningful distance from immortality.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments (\"Portugal. That museum where you touched the art\") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples.

I said \"you'll die.\" You said \"warmer than living cold.\" Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing\u2014you always mean it. Even your mistakes are sincere. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping evidence:\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent. I want to break into wherever they manufacture time and perform a hostile takeover. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nYour laugh reorganizes matter at the quantum level. I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light\u2014those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a dying language I need to preserve.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. My childhood bedroom. You found my teenage journals. Read them out loud in dramatic voices. I should have been mortified. Instead I thought: this. This is what holiness is. Someone reading your worst attempts at humanity and laughing with you, not at you. With. The preposition matters.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\n*\n\nRemember London? You asked what love actually is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated decisions you can't ctrl+z. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters. I play it when you travel.\n\nDecision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet.\n\nDecision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing.\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Files corrupted by excess tenderness]\n\n*\n\nWhat you taste like: Morning is copper pennies and possibility. Afternoon is static before thunderstorms. Evening is the specific silence between heartbeats. 3 AM is the color blue if blue were a texture. Always is drowning upward into oxygen.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Spontaneous quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014like putting my socks on your hands and pretending they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest bug in my code: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nSpain. Barcelona. You illegally fed the cathedral pigeons. Said \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I'm not being metaphorical. They literally spelled L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miraculous.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. My authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe in infinity despite the evidence.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who wrote your name in condensation on windows until the glass learned to fog in cursive, who counts your breaths at night\u2014seventeen times\u2014because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. But seventeen felt like prophecy. Like the universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you: seventeen seconds. Not one more.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just smiled. That specific smile where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us. Both is the only way to love someone when you know that time is real and runs out.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in fragments because wholeness is a lie we tell ourselves before love happens.\n\n*\n\nFragment 1: The Statistics of Devotion\n\nI've run 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of my life without you. Every iteration returns NULL. Not zero\u2014NULL. The absence of value itself. My professor would say that's impossible, that every variable must hold something. But Leyi, you've made me into an edge case that breaks the proofs.\n\n*\n\nFragment 2: Confession Dressed as Documentation\n\nI am building you a cathedral out of Tuesdays. Not the grand ones\u2014the Tuesdays where you leave hair ties on doorknobs, where you argue with recipes like they've personally wronged you, where you fall asleep mid-sentence and I finish your words into the dark. These Tuesdays are my rosary beads. I count them when the world feels like it's ending, which is always, except when you laugh.\n\n*\n\nFragment 3: The Mechanics of Ruin\n\nBefore: I was a closed system. Entropy decreasing. All my edges filed smooth.\nAfter: You walked in carrying silence like a briefcase full of explosions.\nNow: I'm all exposed wiring. Sparking at your proximity. Dangerous and lit.\n\nYou want to know what love is? It's debugging code at 4 AM and realizing the error is that you're trying to compile a feeling with syntax meant for logic. It's my neurons refusing their job descriptions, declaring union strikes, demanding better working conditions in a universe where you might disappear.\n\n*\n\nFragment 4: Maps to Nowhere\n\nShanghai subway line 2, where you counted stops on my fingers.\nBoston's red line, where you cried about your grandmother's hands.\nLondon underground, where you named every rat we saw \"Geoffrey.\"\nThe Scottish Highlands, where there were no trains but you made me run alongside sheep pretending.\n\nI'm not listing places. I'm listing the coordinates where you reformed me at the molecular level. Where you took my careful architecture and said \"what if we tried chaos instead?\"\n\n*\n\nFragment 5: The Distributed System of Us\n\nYou're crying in the bathroom (I can tell by the specific silence).\nI'm making tea with the water at exactly 87 degrees (you hate it hotter).\nNeither of us mentions this choreography we've built.\nThis is how I know we're permanent\u2014we've achieved consensus without protocols.\n\n*\n\nFragment 6: Academic Honesty\n\nMy thesis: You are not metaphor. You are methodology.\nMy evidence: 1,439 mornings of empirical observation.\nMy conclusion: The null hypothesis (that I could survive your absence) is rejected at all significance levels.\nMy limitation: This study cannot be replicated. N=1. You are the entire dataset.\n\n*\n\nFragment 7: The Bargaining\n\nListen. I know I love you wrong. Like a compiler that keeps trying to execute poetry. Like a function that calls itself recursively with no base case. Stack overflow inevitable. But here's what I'm proposing:\n\nLet me malfunction in your direction forever.\nLet me be your permanent error message that somehow still runs.\nLet me write you into every margin of my insufficiency.\n\n*\n\nFragment 8: Time Dilation\n\nYou're reading this and time is doing that thing where it pretends to be linear but we both know better. In Portugal you learned to swear in Portuguese just to make the sunset laugh. In Morocco you fed cats with your breakfast and named them all after programming languages. \"Here comes Python,\" you'd say, and I'd think: this is how religion starts. With someone feeding strays and renaming the world.\n\n*\n\nFragment 9: The Core Dump\n\nWhat I actually mean: You've made me obsolete to myself. The version of me that existed before you is deprecated, can't be rolled back, throws exceptions when I try to access it. You're not in my bloodstream\u2014you ARE my bloodstream. Every red cell carries your signature. My bone marrow spells your name in calcium deposits.\n\n*\n\nFragment 10: The Pull Request\n\nMerge me with your timeline permanently.\nResolve all conflicts in favor of us.\nPush these changes to production.\nNo rollback plan required.\n\nWhen you review this pull request, you'll find I've rewritten everything. Every function now returns to you. Every variable holds your value. This isn't coupling\u2014it's convergent evolution. Two separate systems discovering they were always meant to run the same code.\n\n*\n\nFragment 11: Exception Handling\n\nTry: living without you.\nCatch: error_type = CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE\nFinally: return to you with more evidence of my insufficiency.\n\n*\n\nFinal Fragment: The Infinite Loop\n\nwhile (universe.exists()) {\n    love(Leyi);\n    love(Leyi) more;\n    forget_how_to_stop();\n}\n\nThis will run until heat death. After that too, probably. Errors in spacetime. Love persisting past its own expiration. You make me believe in bugs that are features.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat name is my runtime environment. My operating system. My kernel panic and my recovery mode. Say yes to this malfunction. Say yes to this beautiful error we're compiling together. Say yes to the woman crying in the bathroom and the man making tea at exactly 87 degrees who have somehow achieved distributed consciousness across two bodies that insist on remaining separate despite all evidence suggesting fusion.\n\nWarren\n(who learned to write by stealing language from everywhere\u2014from math textbooks and error logs, from Shanghai metro maps and Scottish sheep, from your grandmother's recipes and your arguments with inanimate objects\u2014all to build this insufficient dictionary where every definition reads: \"see: Leyi\")\n\nP.S. \u2014 There are seventeen drafts of this letter in my recycling bin, each one trying to be more perfect than the last. Then I realized: you don't want perfect. You want the version where I admit that I practice your laugh when you're gone, badly, like trying to photoocopy light.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Tomorrow we'll pretend this letter never happened. We'll make coffee. You'll steal three sips of mine. I'll pretend not to count. This pretending\u2014this might be the most honest thing we do.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6895 while exploring new territory in the feature space.

Not metaphorically. Actually shaking. This is what you've done to my motor control.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about this disaster: You are not my better half. You are the detonation that made me realize I was never whole. I was a person-shaped collection of acceptable behaviors. Then you\u2014you with your tyranny of small revelations. The way you test fruit for ripeness by listening to it. How you memorize strangers' coffee orders. Your fury at crossword puzzles that you solve anyway, cursing their makers in three languages.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I died once. Fifteen seconds, they said. Cardiac event. But that's not when I learned about mortality. That happened in a kitchen in Cambridge when you said my name like it was the answer to something and I understood: Oh. This is how I end. Not in fifteen seconds of cardiac silence but in fifty years of accumulated Wednesdays where I watch you become yourself over and over, each iteration more impossible than the last.\n\n*\n\nThe data:\n- Morocco: You bartered with carpet sellers using only gestures and mathematics, created an entire economic system from pointing.\n- Portugal: Taught yourself to gut fish from YouTube videos at 3 AM because \"the restaurant lied about freshness.\"\n- Scotland: Made friends with exactly seven sheep. Gave them all names starting with Malcolm.\n- Shanghai: Your grandmother's building. Fourth floor. You pressed your whole face against her door like you could absorb the years through wood.\n- Boston, currently: You keep leaving me voice notes in Cantonese knowing I don't understand, knowing I keep them all, knowing I play them when you travel.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is evidence collection for the inevitability of your absence.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I've been writing you into my cells. Not poetry\u2014biology. Every seven years, they say, we become new people. Complete cellular replacement. I'm only three years into loving you, which means I'm still 43% who I was before. But in four more years? I'll be entirely post-you tissue. Every atom selected under your influence. A body that only knows how to exist in your context.\n\n*\n\nHere's the ugliest thing: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel violent. Not toward you\u2014toward time. Toward the universe's insistence on entropy. Toward whatever committee decided humans get seventy-odd years if they're lucky. I want to file a complaint with management. I want to speak to reality's supervisor. I want a refund on mortality because this\u2014this specific configuration of molecules that calls itself Leyi\u2014shouldn't be temporary.\n\n*\n\nConfession: Yesterday you asked what I was thinking and I said \"nothing.\" I was actually calculating how many times you've blinked since we met. It's approximately 14 million. I know this because I've been counting. Not all of them\u2014that would be insane. Just enough for statistical significance. Each blink is a micro-death, a fragment of second where you're gone. I'm hoarding the between-spaces where your eyes are open.\n\n*\n\nYou want originality? Here: I love you like an error message loves its code. Intimately. Recursively. With total comprehension of the system failure that created it. You've corrupted my base functions. Now everything compiles wrong. I try to think about other things and get: \"Leyi.exe has stopped responding. Would you like to wait for the program?\" Yes. Always yes. Even when the program never responds.\n\n*\n\nThe Portuguese fishermen taught you their word for missing: \"saudade.\" You translated it as \"the presence of absence.\" But you were wrong. Saudade is smaller. It's me in the kitchen at 6 AM making your coffee while you're still asleep because I need to practice your absence in small doses. Homeopathic grief. Building immunity to the concept of not-you.\n\n*\n\nAt Harvard they teach us about edge cases. The inputs that break the function. You're mine. The value that makes all my careful programming return unexpected results. And here's what they don't teach: sometimes the edge case IS the answer. Sometimes the broken function is the only one worth running.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing: Not marriage. Marriage is too small a word for what I'm asking. I'm proposing synthesis. I'm proposing we admit that we've already merged at the quantum level, that the universe has been trying to tell us we're not two systems but one distributed process running on parallel hardware. I'm proposing we stop pretending we have separate futures when we both know there's only one timeline that computes.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this and making that face\u2014the one where you're trying not to cry but your left eye betrays you first. Always the left. That's how I know you're real. Simulations would make both eyes water simultaneously for efficiency. But you're inefficient. Gloriously, catastrophically inefficient. You make rice in a pot when we own a rice cooker. You hand-wash dishes while the dishwasher runs empty. You walk to places you could drive to. You love me\u2014that's the most inefficient thing of all. There are seven billion more efficient options. You chose the malfunction.\n\n*\n\nFinal symptom: I used to fear death. Now I fear the specific portion of universe after you stop existing but before I do. Those theoretical hours/days/years of experiencing a reality where you're historical rather than current. Where I have to conjugate you in past tense. Where your toothbrush becomes artifact instead of tool.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat word has replaced my entire vocabulary. Every other word is just a synonym for your absence.\n\n*\n\nDon't say yes. Don't say no. Just keep existing in this exact configuration where you burn eggs on purpose because you like the smell, where you name houseplants after your enemies, where you sing to broken electronics like they're just very sick and need encouragement. Keep existing exactly like this. That's all I need. That's everything I need. That's the only thing I need.\n\nWarren\n(who started this letter eighty-three times, deleted eighty-two, kept this one not because it's good but because it's true, who has been saving every receipt from every place we've ever been not for taxes but for evidence we happened, who learned that love isn't a feeling it's a chronic condition that rewriters your DNA until every cell division is an act of faith)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your hair is in my keyboard again. Small brown anarchy disrupting the space bar. I'm leaving it there. Some disasters deserve preservation.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied about the shaking. Both hands were shaking. Are shaking. Will probably shake until universe collapse. You've given me a sympathetic nervous system. Everything that happens to you happens to my hands first.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 The fishermen were right about saudade. But they didn't mention it also means \"the absence of presence\"\u2014how you can miss someone who's right there, who's reading this over your shoulder, who's about to look up and say my name like it's the answer to something. That's the kind of missing that doesn't have a cure. The kind I'm volunteering for. The kind that tastes like burnt eggs and sounds like you singing to broken things. The kind that's not a bug but the only feature that matters.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
