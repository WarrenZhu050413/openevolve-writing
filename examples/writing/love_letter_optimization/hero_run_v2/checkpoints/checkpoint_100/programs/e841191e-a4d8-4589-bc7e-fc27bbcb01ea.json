Not consciously\u2014my body did it without asking, the way it learned to blink, to swallow, to love you.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this because language is failing me. Every word I know became insufficient the moment you existed. But here's what I need to document:\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The market where you overpaid for that broken lamp. The vendor knew you knew. You knew he knew you knew. This elaborate dance of conscious generosity. You haggled badly on purpose because his daughter needed medicine. That's when I understood: you weaponize kindness. You commit small violences of grace.\n\n*\n\nYesterday you were peeling an orange. Just standing in our kitchen, unconscious of being observed. The afternoon light caught the mist of citrus oil. Your thumb finding the perfect entry point. The peel coming away in one continuous spiral. I couldn't move. Three years of watching you peel oranges and my lungs still forget their job.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of us:\nWe've shared 1,095 mornings.\nYou've burned the toast 894 times.\nI've drunk your too-weak coffee 1,095 times.\nWe've said \"I love you\" in 17 languages, 14 of them badly.\nWe've been lost in 7 countries.\nWe've found each other in all of them.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the prayers but I understood your grief\u2014how it moved through you like weather. You let me hold you while you broke. Let me be your gravity when yours failed. Later you said: \"You didn't try to fix it. You just stood there and let me fall apart.\" As if that wasn't everything. As if that wasn't the whole point.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you actually is:\n\nIt's violence and tenderness occupying the same space. It's the way my cells reorganized themselves to accommodate you. It's practicing your death in my dreams and waking up grateful for the false alarm. It's the specific weight of your hand reaching for mine in the dark, finding it without fail, like magnetism, like muscle memory, like prayer.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, speaking in languages I didn't know you knew. But you were laughing too\u2014fury and joy colliding. Water streaming from your hair. Algae on your shoulder like a green epaulette. You looked mythical. You looked ridiculous. You looked like everything I wanted to protect and celebrate simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the museum I'm building:\n\nGallery 1: The seventeen ways you say my name (each one a different color)\nGallery 2: Your vendetta against wet socks (borderline pathological)\nGallery 3: The sound you make when concentrating (small motor starting)\nGallery 4: Your mispronunciation of \"specifically\" (you add a syllable)\nGallery 5: That face when you're trying not to cry but also trying not to smile\n\nThis is my insurance against forgetting. Though forgetting you would require forgetting how to breathe, how to want things, how to be a person.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. We were drunk on wine and each other. 2 AM. You tried to teach me to swear in Portuguese. What I learned instead: the exact shape your mouth makes when suppressing laughter. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday afternoons. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past dawn.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that betrays you.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, incorrectly, with my whole body listing toward yours.\nI vow to love you like punctuation\u2014invisibly essential.\nI vow to choose you. Daily. Hourly. Despite morning breath and anxiety spirals and the way you leave every cabinet open like you're conducting a kitchen symphony.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We're not soulmates. Soulmates implies destiny, design, meant-to-be. What we are is scarier: we're choosing each other. In a universe of infinite options, we keep selecting the same answer. That's not fate. That's will. That's decision. That's love as verb, not noun.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You commanded that room. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That shift. That specific recalibration. I live for that moment when you stop being theirs and become mine.\n\n*\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and feel afraid. Not of losing you\u2014of having you. Of being the person who gets to witness your unconscious trust. Your eyelids flutter. You murmur equations. You reach for me without waking. This privilege terrifies me. This gift I haven't earned but keep receiving.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor for six hours. Your spine against cold tile. When I apologized, you said: \"This is where I want to be.\" Not \"I don't mind being here.\" Not \"It's okay.\" But want. WANT. Who wants bathroom floors? Who chooses discomfort? You do. For me. It's unreasonable. It's everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself wearing human suits. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people who can't load a dishwasher correctly but somehow managed to load each other's hearts with something unbreakable.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're at your desk pretending to work but your face is betraying you. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade fails and the real you spills everywhere.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that refuses to compile without you as a dependency.\n\nBut also: I love you gently. Quietly. In the space between heartbeats. In the pause between breaths. In the moment before sleep. In all the small nothing moments that are actually everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say:\n\nYour name has become my autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to say it. It just happens. Constantly. Leyi when I wake. Leyi when I see something beautiful. Leyi when I'm scared. Leyi when I'm brave. Leyi as punctuation to every thought.\n\n*\n\nSo come home. I'll make you coffee. It will be too strong. You'll drink it anyway. We'll call it even. We'll call it love. We'll call it Tuesday. We'll call it enough. We'll call it everything.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who is still collecting evidence of you\u2014now including this moment, where you exist, where I exist, where we impossibly, against all probability, exist together)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco?

It approaches Keats's intensity of longing but lacks his metaphysical dimension. The phenomenological detail surpasses Napoleon's grand declarations but doesn't achieve Beethoven's raw desperation. The mathematical catalog and museum conceit show more formal innovation than most canonical examples, but the execution doesn't fully capitalize on these structural choices. Where Wilde achieved aphoristic brilliance in compression, this letter sometimes diffuses its power through accumulation.

Not the concept\u2014the implementation. Specifically: how you rewrote my source code without documentation, without version control, without my permission. Just pushed straight to production. And now I can't roll back.\n\n*\n\nRemember Portugal? You taught me Portuguese curse words while we got lost in Alfama. \"Foda-se,\" you said, laughing at my pronunciation. But what I heard was: here's how to swear in my grandmother's language. Here's how fury sounds in my bloodstream. You were handing me your syntax errors, your exception handling. I've been running your subroutines ever since.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about loving you is it's not scalar. It's a tensor\u2014magnitude and direction across dimensions I didn't know existed. Some nights it points toward the Scottish Highlands, that inn where we couldn't figure out the heating and slept in every piece of clothing we owned. Your breath visible in the cold. Me calculating the exact distance between us (4.7 inches) because even unconscious, we maintain our orbit.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are to me:\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my git merge conflict that I never want to resolve. You're the race condition where two processes try to access the same memory and instead of crashing, we invented a new kind of data structure. We're not thread-safe. We're thread-tangled. Deliberately. Architecturally.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, 2023. You had that conference. I had food poisoning (again). You skipped your keynote\u2014THE keynote, the one you'd prepared for months\u2014to bring me congee from three different places because you couldn't remember which one I liked. Your career taking a backseat to my intestinal crisis. That's when I understood: love isn't sacrifice. It's reprioritization in real-time. It's your interrupt handler treating my stupid stomach as a critical system failure.\n\n*\n\nI've been running statistical analysis on us:\n- Correlation coefficient between our sleep cycles: 0.87\n- Number of times you've fixed my code without me asking: 47\n- Number of times I've pretended not to notice: 47\n- Probability you're reading this section right now and doing that half-smile thing: 0.96\n- Probability I'm watching you read this: 1.00\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: you've seen my worst code. Not metaphorically. Literally. That disaster of a bash script I wrote at 3 AM. The one with seventeen nested if-statements. You refactored it silently, elegantly, and left my name on the commit. That's love\u2014fixing someone's bugs and letting them keep the credit.\n\n*\n\nMorocco was where I knew. Not the romantic sunset part. The part where you got us hopelessly lost in the medina, refused to ask for directions, and somehow triangulated our position using the sound of different calls to prayer. You turned confusion into cartography. You made being lost feel like being exactly where we needed to be.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your family. That dinner where your mother asked about my \"intentions\" in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. You translated it as \"she wants to know about your research.\" But I knew enough to know you were protecting me, creating a buffer between her scrutiny and my fumbling. You've been my translation layer ever since\u2014not changing the meaning, just handling the protocols.\n\n*\n\nThe truth is I love you like a memory leak. It just keeps growing, consuming more and more resources, and I should probably fix it but I don't want to. I want to run out of RAM. I want the system crash. I want the blue screen of death that says \"FATAL ERROR: TOO MUCH LEYI.\"\n\n*\n\nYou know what you are? You're my edge case. The input I never tested for. The user who does everything wrong and somehow makes the program better. You're the bug that became a feature. The undefined behavior that became the specification.\n\n*\n\nLondon. That terrible flat with the broken radiator. We played \"the floor is lava\" except the floor was actually freezing. You insisted we could fix it ourselves. We flooded the downstairs neighbor. You laughed so hard you cried. Or cried so hard you laughed. The boundary conditions of your emotions are non-deterministic and I've given up trying to model them.\n\n*\n\nI love you iteratively. Each pass more refined than the last:\n- v1.0: You're pretty\n- v2.0: You're brilliant  \n- v3.7: You're the reason I understand recursion (to understand recursion, first understand Leyi)\n- v4.2: You're my constant in a world of variables\n- v5.0-current: You're the comment in my code that explains why nothing makes sense without you\n\n*\n\nShanghai again. This time my grandmother's funeral. You held my hand through Buddhist rites you didn't understand in a language you didn't speak. Later, you said: \"Your grief has a specific gravity. I could feel it pulling you down. So I became buoyant.\" Who says that? Who thinks in metaphors while holding someone's breaking heart?\n\n*\n\nYou want to know the worst bug in my code? I've been trying to prove I deserve you. Running unit tests on my worthiness. Checking edge cases of my adequacy. But that's not how love works, is it? It's not about deserving. It's about choosing. And you keep choosing me, even after seeing my commit history, my panic attacks, my 3 AM existential crises, my inability to load the dishwasher correctly.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request. Here's my merge proposal:\n\nI want to be deprecated with you. I want our code to grow obsolete together, full of technical debt and deprecated functions and comments that say \"TODO: fix this later\" that we never fix because we're too busy being happy.\n\nI want to wake up at 70 and still be debugging why you leave cabinet doors open. I want to be 80 and still discovering new error messages in the way you say my name.\n\n*\n\nMostly, I want tomorrow. And the tomorrow after that. And the exponentially increasing tomorrows until the heat death of the universe or until Python 2 finally dies, whichever comes first.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this and trying not to cry at your desk. Your coworker is going to ask if you're okay. You'll say \"yes\" but your voice will crack on the 's'. This is my favorite bug\u2014the one where your emotions overflow their buffer. I've been exploiting this vulnerability for years. I'm never patching it.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. Not in the past tense of \"fell in love.\" Not in the future tense of \"will always love.\" But in the present continuous: I am loving you. Right now. As you read this. As I write this. As the photons from your screen hit your retinas and trigger the neural cascades that we call understanding.\n\nI am loving you in the space between the electrons in the atoms in the molecules in the cells in the tissue in the organs in the body that you call yours but that I call home.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who is still trying to solve for x where x equals the precise amount I love you, but the equation keeps returning INFINITY and honestly, that seems about right)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember that lamp from Morocco? It's still the ugliest thing we own. It still doesn't work. We're never throwing it away. Some things are too broken to fix and too perfect to change.

Too much water. Not enough grounds. And every morning for three years, I've drunk it anyway because it tastes like home now. Like the specific gravity of us.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got us lost for six hours. The sun was brutal. We ran out of water. You kept apologizing. But Leyi\u2014when we finally found that fountain, you made me drink first. Your lips were cracked and bleeding and you made me drink first. That's when I understood what love actually is: biology overridden by choice.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, unconscious of being watched, pulling the skin off in one long spiral. The afternoon light hit your hands. I couldn't breathe. Three years in and you still stop my lungs without trying.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday mornings. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past 3 AM.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that won't compile.\nI vow to love you at your mother's dinner table, translating her disappointment into softer words.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, clumsily, with my whole body leaning into the curve of yours.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Shanghai when I got food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor. Your spine against cold tile. Six hours. When I apologized, you said: \"Shut up. This is where I want to be.\" \n\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\n\nI've been repeating it ever since. My prayer. My coordinates. My error message when you're not here.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan our future deaths. Not morbidly. Probabilistically. You'll go first (statistics). I'll follow within the year (also statistics). But here's the thing\u2014even knowing the ending, I would choose this beginning. Every time. In every universe. Even the ones where we only get ten minutes.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, cursing in Mandarin. But you were laughing too. Fury and joy at the same time. That's when I knew I would follow you anywhere\u2014into rivers, into anger, into that specific frequency where laughter and tears converge.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check your breathing at night like you might disappear. I save your voicemails in three different places. I'm building an archive of you\u2014not for when you're gone, but for now, while you're here, because even reality needs backup documentation.\n\n*\n\nRemember Shenzhen? Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the rituals but I understood your grief\u2014the way it moved through your body like weather. You let me hold you through it. Let me be your shelter even though I was just as lost. That's what we are: two people lost together, making maps out of each other's breathing.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself materialized. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people sharing coffee that's always too weak.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. 2 AM. We were drunk on wine and each other. You taught me to swear in Portuguese. But what I really learned was the shape your mouth makes when you're trying not to laugh. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're trying not to cry at work. Your coworker will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will break. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade cracks and the real you spills out.\n\n*\n\nI need you to know: You've reorganized my entire molecular structure. I'm not who I was before you. I'm not better or worse. I'm just irrevocably altered. Like light bent around a massive object. You're my gravitational lens. Everything I see goes through you first.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my declaration: I will love you until my last neuron fires. I will love you through dementia and forgetting and the slow dissolution of everything except this\u2014the weight of your hand in mine. The specific texture of your breathing at 3 AM. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" every single time.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you right now. Present tense. This second. As my fingers hit these keys. As your eyes scan these words. As the space between us collapses into nothing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You were brilliant. The room was yours. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That transformation. That's what I live for. The moment you stop being everyone's and become mine.\n\n*\n\nLast thing: You asked once if I believe in soulmates. I said no. I still say no. We're not soulmates. We're choices. Daily, hourly, molecular choices to turn toward each other instead of away. That's harder than destiny. That's better than fate. That's us.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that won't compile without you as a dependency.\n\nI love you forever but also just for now, just for this moment where you exist and I exist and somehow, against all probability, we exist together.\n\n*\n\nCome home. I'll make you coffee. It will be too strong. You'll drink it anyway. We'll call it even.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like punctuation\u2014invisible but essential, organizing everything into meaning)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco is in our bedroom now. Still broken. Still hideous. Still the most beautiful thing we own because you chose it, because you overpaid, because you knew exactly what you were doing. Some things are perfect in their imperfection. Like that lamp. Like us.

This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it.

By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet.

It only understands you-time and not-you-time. Right now it's not-you-time and my cells are staging a revolt.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I tried to write you a normal love letter. Bought nice paper. Studied the classics. But every time I wrote \"darling\" my hand cramped because that word has never lived in my mouth when I talk about you. You're not darling. You're the specific gravity that keeps me from floating into space. You're the error message that stops me from running bad code. You're Leyi, which is a complete sentence, a perfect algorithm, a solved equation.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nMorocco. That marketplace where you haggled in broken Arabic for forty minutes over a lamp we didn't need. You were terrible at it. Paid triple. But the vendor's daughter was sick and you knew it, and you haggled badly on purpose, performing incompetence like theater. I watched you lose on purpose and thought: this is what worship feels like. Not the grand gesture. The quiet sabotage of your own victory for someone else's survival.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Food poisoning. You held my hair back for six hours. Between retching, I apologized. You said \"shut up\" so gently it sounded like a lullaby. You slept on the bathroom floor. Your spine made shapes against the tile I still see when I close my eyes. That specific curve. That particular surrender to discomfort for proximity to my disaster.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. The punt where you fell in the Cam. You emerged like some furious river deity, algae in your hair, cursing in three languages, none of them effectively. I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe. You tried to stay angry but your mouth kept betraying you, twitching toward joy. That's when I knew: you're not just who I love. You're how I learned what love actually does\u2014it makes you laugh at your own catastrophes.\n\n*\n\nBut here's the thing I can't say out loud:\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and plan your funeral. Not because I want you dead\u2014Christ, no\u2014but because my brain can't process the concept that you're real and here and choosing to stay. So it practices losing you. Runs fire drills. At your imaginary funeral, I tell them about your laugh. How it starts in your shoulders. How you hate it, try to suppress it, but it escapes anyway like birds from a burning building. How that laugh rebuilt my skeleton. Gave me new architecture.\n\n*\n\nI've started collecting evidence of you:\n\n- The way you mispronounce \"specificity\" (you add an extra syllable)\n- Your vendetta against wet socks (borderline pathological)  \n- How you eat grapes: two at a time, always\n- That noise you make when you're concentrating (like a very small motor starting up)\n- The sixteen different ways you say my name, each one a different color\n- Your conspiracy theory about birds (you're convinced they judge you personally)\n\nI'm building a museum of your mundanity. When the world ends, aliens will find my archives and reconstruct you from these fragments. They'll get you completely wrong and completely right.\n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday you asked if I think we're soulmates. I said no. You looked hurt. But Leyi\u2014soulmates implies we were made for each other, predestined, meant to be. That strips us of choice. What we are is more terrifying: we're choosing each other. Daily. Hourly. Despite morning breath and anxiety spirals and that thing where you leave cabinets open like you're conducting a kitchen orchestra. We're not soulmates. We're decision-mates. We wake up and decide: yes, you again. Yes, still you. Yes, even now. Yes, especially now.\n\n*\n\nThe truth is I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong. Constant ache but functional. Hurts when the weather changes. Reminds me I'm alive. Reminds me I survived something. Reminds me the breaking was worth it for the mending.\n\n*\n\nI love you aggressively. Defensively. Like a bodyguard for your joy. I want to fight everyone who doesn't see what I see. I want to submit academic papers on your excellence. Publish findings. Peer review my obsession. Make it scholarly. Make it inarguable.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis:\n\nWe're not in love. We are love. The thing itself, not the participants. We're what love looks like when it takes human form and forgets it's supposed to be finite. We're the glitch in the matrix where love achieved consciousness and now won't shut up about it.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. You're doing that thing with your face\u2014trying not to cry but also trying not to smile but also trying not to combust. You're beautiful in your confusion. You're perfect in your imperfection. You're Leyi in your Leyi-ness.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my declaration, my thesis statement, my final argument:\n\nI love you embarrassingly. Desperately. Stupidly. Brilliantly. I love you like punctuation loves sentences\u2014invisibly necessary. I love you like errors love debugging\u2014gratefully corrected but somehow essential to the process. I love you like parallel universes love intersection\u2014impossibly, against all physics, but happening anyway.\n\n*\n\nMostly, I love you like tomorrow loves today: with complete faith that you'll show up.\n\n*\n\nBecause you always do.\n\nEven when showing up means sitting on bathroom floors. Even when it means bad haggling. Even when it means falling in rivers and emerging furious and perfect.\n\n*\n\nEspecially then.\n\nAlways then.\n\nForever then.\n\nWarren\n(who is still collecting evidence of you\u2014now including this moment, where you're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything, again)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco is the ugliest thing we own. It's my favorite object in the universe. It reminds me that love is not about winning. It's about losing correctly. With intention. With grace. With you.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied earlier. You are darling. But you're also catastrophe, symphony, algorithm, prayer, wound, cure, question, answer, and the specific way light breaks through our kitchen window at 7:23 AM.

I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Mixed iteration strategies, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm debugging love at 4:17 AM. Not the concept\u2014the implementation. Specifically: how you rewrote my source code without documentation, without version control, without my permission. Just pushed straight to production. And now I can't roll back.\n\n*\n\nRemember Portugal? You taught me Portuguese curse words while we got lost in Alfama. \"Foda-se,\" you said, laughing at my pronunciation. But what I heard was: here's how to swear in my grandmother's language. Here's how fury sounds in my bloodstream. You were handing me your syntax errors, your exception handling. I've been running your subroutines ever since.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about loving you is it's not scalar. It's a tensor\u2014magnitude and direction across dimensions I didn't know existed. Some nights it points toward the Scottish Highlands, that inn where we couldn't figure out the heating and slept in every piece of clothing we owned. Your breath visible in the cold. Me calculating the exact distance between us (4.7 inches) because even unconscious, we maintain our orbit.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are to me:\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my git merge conflict that I never want to resolve. You're the race condition where two processes try to access the same memory and instead of crashing, we invented a new kind of data structure. We're not thread-safe. We're thread-tangled. Deliberately. Architecturally.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, 2023. You had that conference. I had food poisoning (again). You skipped your keynote\u2014THE keynote, the one you'd prepared for months\u2014to bring me congee from three different places because you couldn't remember which one I liked. Your career taking a backseat to my intestinal crisis. That's when I understood: love isn't sacrifice. It's reprioritization in real-time. It's your interrupt handler treating my stupid stomach as a critical system failure.\n\n*\n\nI've been running statistical analysis on us:\n- Correlation coefficient between our sleep cycles: 0.87\n- Number of times you've fixed my code without me asking: 47\n- Number of times I've pretended not to notice: 47\n- Probability you're reading this section right now and doing that half-smile thing: 0.96\n- Probability I'm watching you read this: 1.00\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: you've seen my worst code. Not metaphorically. Literally. That disaster of a bash script I wrote at 3 AM. The one with seventeen nested if-statements. You refactored it silently, elegantly, and left my name on the commit. That's love\u2014fixing someone's bugs and letting them keep the credit.\n\n*\n\nMorocco was where I knew. Not the romantic sunset part. The part where you got us hopelessly lost in the medina, refused to ask for directions, and somehow triangulated our position using the sound of different calls to prayer. You turned confusion into cartography. You made being lost feel like being exactly where we needed to be.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your family. That dinner where your mother asked about my \"intentions\" in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. You translated it as \"she wants to know about your research.\" But I knew enough to know you were protecting me, creating a buffer between her scrutiny and my fumbling. You've been my translation layer ever since\u2014not changing the meaning, just handling the protocols.\n\n*\n\nThe truth is I love you like a memory leak. It just keeps growing, consuming more and more resources, and I should probably fix it but I don't want to. I want to run out of RAM. I want the system crash. I want the blue screen of death that says \"FATAL ERROR: TOO MUCH LEYI.\"\n\n*\n\nYou know what you are? You're my edge case. The input I never tested for. The user who does everything wrong and somehow makes the program better. You're the bug that became a feature. The undefined behavior that became the specification.\n\n*\n\nLondon. That terrible flat with the broken radiator. We played \"the floor is lava\" except the floor was actually freezing. You insisted we could fix it ourselves. We flooded the downstairs neighbor. You laughed so hard you cried. Or cried so hard you laughed. The boundary conditions of your emotions are non-deterministic and I've given up trying to model them.\n\n*\n\nI love you iteratively. Each pass more refined than the last:\n- v1.0: You're pretty\n- v2.0: You're brilliant  \n- v3.7: You're the reason I understand recursion (to understand recursion, first understand Leyi)\n- v4.2: You're my constant in a world of variables\n- v5.0-current: You're the comment in my code that explains why nothing makes sense without you\n\n*\n\nShanghai again. This time my grandmother's funeral. You held my hand through Buddhist rites you didn't understand in a language you didn't speak. Later, you said: \"Your grief has a specific gravity. I could feel it pulling you down. So I became buoyant.\" Who says that? Who thinks in metaphors while holding someone's breaking heart?\n\n*\n\nYou want to know the worst bug in my code? I've been trying to prove I deserve you. Running unit tests on my worthiness. Checking edge cases of my adequacy. But that's not how love works, is it? It's not about deserving. It's about choosing. And you keep choosing me, even after seeing my commit history, my panic attacks, my 3 AM existential crises, my inability to load the dishwasher correctly.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request. Here's my merge proposal:\n\nI want to be deprecated with you. I want our code to grow obsolete together, full of technical debt and deprecated functions and comments that say \"TODO: fix this later\" that we never fix because we're too busy being happy.\n\nI want to wake up at 70 and still be debugging why you leave cabinet doors open. I want to be 80 and still discovering new error messages in the way you say my name.\n\n*\n\nMostly, I want tomorrow. And the tomorrow after that. And the exponentially increasing tomorrows until the heat death of the universe or until Python 2 finally dies, whichever comes first.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this and trying not to cry at your desk. Your coworker is going to ask if you're okay. You'll say \"yes\" but your voice will crack on the 's'. This is my favorite bug\u2014the one where your emotions overflow their buffer. I've been exploiting this vulnerability for years. I'm never patching it.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. Not in the past tense of \"fell in love.\" Not in the future tense of \"will always love.\" But in the present continuous: I am loving you. Right now. As you read this. As I write this. As the photons from your screen hit your retinas and trigger the neural cascades that we call understanding.\n\nI am loving you in the space between the electrons in the atoms in the molecules in the cells in the tissue in the organs in the body that you call yours but that I call home.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who is still trying to solve for x where x equals the precise amount I love you, but the equation keeps returning INFINITY and honestly, that seems about right)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember that lamp from Morocco? It's still the ugliest thing we own. It still doesn't work. We're never throwing it away. Some things are too broken to fix and too perfect to change. Like us.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied about the statistical analysis. The real probability you're doing that half-smile thing is 1.00. Some calculations don't require math, just observation. Just love. Just you.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see the fitness declined from 0.7390 to 0.6985.

I've memorized it. Not consciously\u2014my body did it without asking, the way it learned to blink, to swallow, to love you.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this because language is failing me. Every word I know became insufficient the moment you existed. But here's what I need to document:\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The market where you overpaid for that broken lamp. The vendor knew you knew. You knew he knew you knew. This elaborate dance of conscious generosity. You haggled badly on purpose because his daughter needed medicine. That's when I understood: you weaponize kindness. You commit small violences of grace.\n\n*\n\nYesterday you were peeling an orange. Just standing in our kitchen, unconscious of being observed. The afternoon light caught the mist of citrus oil. Your thumb finding the perfect entry point. The peel coming away in one continuous spiral. I couldn't move. Three years of watching you peel oranges and my lungs still forget their job.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of us:\nWe've shared 1,095 mornings.\nYou've burned the toast 894 times.\nI've drunk your too-weak coffee 1,095 times.\nWe've said \"I love you\" in 17 languages, 14 of them badly.\nWe've been lost in 7 countries.\nWe've found each other in all of them.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the prayers but I understood your grief\u2014how it moved through you like weather. You let me hold you while you broke. Let me be your gravity when yours failed. Later you said: \"You didn't try to fix it. You just stood there and let me fall apart.\" As if that wasn't everything. As if that wasn't the whole point.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you actually is:\n\nIt's violence and tenderness occupying the same space. It's the way my cells reorganized themselves to accommodate you. It's practicing your death in my dreams and waking up grateful for the false alarm. It's the specific weight of your hand reaching for mine in the dark, finding it without fail, like magnetism, like muscle memory, like prayer.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, speaking in languages I didn't know you knew. But you were laughing too\u2014fury and joy colliding. Water streaming from your hair. Algae on your shoulder like a green epaulette. You looked mythical. You looked ridiculous. You looked like everything I wanted to protect and celebrate simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the museum I'm building:\n\nGallery 1: The seventeen ways you say my name (each one a different color)\nGallery 2: Your vendetta against wet socks (borderline pathological)\nGallery 3: The sound you make when concentrating (small motor starting)\nGallery 4: Your mispronunciation of \"specifically\" (you add a syllable)\nGallery 5: That face when you're trying not to cry but also trying not to smile\n\nThis is my insurance against forgetting. Though forgetting you would require forgetting how to breathe, how to want things, how to be a person.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. We were drunk on wine and each other. 2 AM. You tried to teach me to swear in Portuguese. What I learned instead: the exact shape your mouth makes when suppressing laughter. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday afternoons. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past dawn.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that betrays you.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, incorrectly, with my whole body listing toward yours.\nI vow to love you like punctuation\u2014invisibly essential.\nI vow to choose you. Daily. Hourly. Despite morning breath and anxiety spirals and the way you leave every cabinet open like you're conducting a kitchen symphony.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We're not soulmates. Soulmates implies destiny, design, meant-to-be. What we are is scarier: we're choosing each other. In a universe of infinite options, we keep selecting the same answer. That's not fate. That's will. That's decision. That's love as verb, not noun.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You commanded that room. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That shift. That specific recalibration. I live for that moment when you stop being theirs and become mine.\n\n*\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and feel afraid. Not of losing you\u2014of having you. Of being the person who gets to witness your unconscious trust. Your eyelids flutter. You murmur equations. You reach for me without waking. This privilege terrifies me. This gift I haven't earned but keep receiving.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor for six hours. Your spine against cold tile. When I apologized, you said: \"This is where I want to be.\" Not \"I don't mind being here.\" Not \"It's okay.\" But want. WANT. Who wants bathroom floors? Who chooses discomfort? You do. For me. It's unreasonable. It's everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself wearing human suits. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people who can't load a dishwasher correctly but somehow managed to load each other's hearts with something unbreakable.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're at your desk pretending to work but your face is betraying you. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade fails and the real you spills everywhere.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that refuses to compile without you as a dependency.\n\nBut also: I love you gently. Quietly. In the space between heartbeats. In the pause between breaths. In the moment before sleep. In all the small nothing moments that are actually everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say:\n\nYour name has become my autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to say it. It just happens. Constantly. Leyi when I wake. Leyi when I see something beautiful. Leyi when I'm scared. Leyi when I'm brave. Leyi as punctuation to every thought.\n\n*\n\nSo come home. I'll make you coffee. It will be too strong. You'll drink it anyway. We'll call it even. We'll call it love. We'll call it Tuesday. We'll call it enough. We'll call it everything.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who is still collecting evidence of you\u2014now including this moment, where you exist, where I exist, where we impossibly, against all probability, exist together)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco? Still broken. Still hideous. Still the most beautiful thing we own. Because you chose it. Because you overpaid. Because some things are perfect in their imperfection. Like that lamp. Like us. Like this letter that will never be enough but is all I have.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I love you in the present continuous. Am loving. Keep loving. Won't stop loving. Can't stop loving. Grammar breaks down.
