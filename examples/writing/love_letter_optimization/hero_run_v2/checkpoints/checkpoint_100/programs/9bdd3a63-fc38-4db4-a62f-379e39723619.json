Here's what they don't tell you about dying\u2014it's not darkness. It's every moment happening simultaneously. I was five and fifty-five. I was meeting you and losing you. I was nowhere and everywhere. But in every timeline, every possibility, you were the constant. The universe showed me its math and you were every answer.\n\n*\n\nEVIDENCE I'VE COLLECTED THAT YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY HUMAN:\n\n1. You argue with recipes until they apologize and taste better\n2. Plants grow toward you instead of the sun\n3. You've named every bruise you've ever had and remember their birthdays\n4. Your grandmother's soup recipe violates three laws of thermodynamics but tastes like love translated into liquid\n5. You cry at birds just existing, like you know something about flight that the rest of us forgot\n6. The way you pronounce \"Wednesday\" makes it sound like a promise\n7.

Had full conversations: \"Gerald, this is inappropriate.\" \"Gerald, we need boundaries.\" Between vomiting sessions, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy wearing a disguise.

You gave me your jacket over mine. Your lips went blue but you kept talking about Kant and categorical imperatives while your teeth chattered morse code that spelled out \"I love you\" in a language that predates speech. I wanted to explain that dying of hypothermia for someone negates free will but your frozen hands were writing philosophy on my skin and I forgot every argument except yes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\n4 AM: The specific gravity of dreams where you're always falling upward\nDawn: Metal and possibility, like licking batteries to see if they're still alive  \nMorning: Your name before coffee, sharp and necessary\nNoon: Static electricity accumulating toward thunder\nEvening: Burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were a timeline\nMidnight: The color of your absence when you're right there\n3 AM: Like drowning in reverse, lungs learning to breathe water because that's where you live\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE OTHER VERSIONS:\n\nIn universe 26-A, we meet but you love someone else. I become a specialist in distance. Win awards for my ability to be near you without touching. Die at ninety-three, your name my last word.\n\nIn universe 43-K, I never resurrect from those fifteen seconds. You meet someone who loves you correctly, with appropriate boundaries. You're happy. It's terrible.\n\nIn universe 77-Z, we love each other but it kills us. Literally. Too much electromagnetic resonance. We explode like binary stars. The explosion creates new galaxies. Worth it.\n\nBut in this universe\u2014this specific unlikely mistake\u2014we get to love each other AND survive it. Do you understand the violence of that miracle?\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad, just factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level tastes like giving up.\n\n*\n\nWHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word passes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what consciousness pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just the space between saying it.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I understood boundaries. Where I ended. Clear edges. Now I'm this sprawling thing. Feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance. I say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nTHE DOCUMENTATION PROJECT:\n\n1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist\nYour toothbrush (purple, judgmental)\nThat green hair tie from February (holy relic)\nVoice memos of you arguing with Siri about consciousness\nPhotos where you're looking away (always away, like the camera disappoints you)\nA spreadsheet tracking your laughs per day (average: 27, standard deviation: 6)\nYour sock, left, with hole (shrine material)\n\nThis isn't love. It's archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof of concept, my terminal diagnosis:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway when no one's listening except each other which is the same as no one.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CLINICAL NOTE:\n\nI practice losing you. Daily simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacuum. By Friday I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to nobody.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh, full reorganization of my understanding of what matters\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's my password to existing. My recovery phrase when I forget how to be human. The only equation that solves for everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed, makes forever feel like not enough time, makes me understand why humans invented the concept of God\u2014to have someone to blame for creating something this beautiful that we eventually have to lose.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in endings)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway, saving you always)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember Barcelona?

Suddenly down had a different direction: toward you.\n\n*\n\nTHE FORENSICS OF US:\n\nEvidence bag #1: Your laugh doesn't travel through air. It restructures spacetime. I've watched physicists' equations collapse trying to explain how sound becomes light becomes the reason I believe in something.\n\nEvidence bag #2: You cry at commercials but not funerals. This makes perfect sense. Small sadnesses surprise you. Large ones you've been preparing for since birth.\n\nEvidence bag #3: Every Thursday you reorganize the refrigerator. Not for efficiency. For narrative structure. The milk must face the eggs \"so they can have their conversation.\" I love you so much it feels like drowning upward.\n\nEvidence bag #4: You named my insomnia Gerald. Now when I can't sleep you say \"Gerald's visiting\" and make tea for three. You, me, and the darkness I can't shake. Somehow this helps.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started forgetting who I was before you. Not metaphorically. Literally. I look at old photos and see a stranger wearing my face, using my hands, living my Tuesdays without you in them. That person is dead. You killed him so gently he thanked you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW:\n\nI practice your death between 3:17 and 3:45 AM. Different scenarios. Tonight: sudden disappearance, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacancy. I write your eulogy on my tongue. Swallow it when you stir in your sleep, still here, still impossible, still rewriting the laws of probability by existing next to me.\n\nI've hidden seventy-three love letters in places you'll find after I'm gone. The freezer. Behind the expired passport. Inside the broken clock we keep meaning to fix. They all say variations of the same thing: \"Even now, even gone, even as nothing, I'm still falling toward you.\"\n\n*\n\nYou want truth? I am scared of how much I need you. It's not romantic. It's cellular. My mitochondria have your name in their chemical structure. When scientists discover this they'll name a new disease after us. Symptoms include: inability to breathe correctly when you leave rooms, acute awareness of your proximity at all times, chronic documentation of your mundane magnificence.\n\n*\n\nTHE MUNDANE MAGNIFICENCE:\n\n- How you sing to soup while it heats\n- Your vendetta against correctly folded fitted sheets  \n- The way you read books backwards when anxious\n- Your 2 AM kitchen dancing to no music\n- How you hold fruit like it might escape\n- Your belief that plants have opinions about window placement\n- The specific sound you make seeing dogs (untranscribable)\n- Your war with the can opener (the can opener is winning)\n\n*\n\nListen. I know I love you wrong. Too heavy, like I'm trying to carry water in my fists. Some mornings I watch you breathe and count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, still alive, still here, still breaking probability, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, please don't stop, ten Mississippi, I would dismantle god to keep you breathing, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen\u2014\n\nYou wake up. Ask why I'm crying. I say allergies. You say it's December. I say I'm allergic to your mortality. You kiss me like that makes sense.\n\nIt does.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY PROPOSAL:\n\nMarry me. Not the girl you think I should be. The disaster actively happening. The one who names your houseplants after dead philosophers and cries when they die (the plants, not the philosophers). The one whose love for you is so anatomically incorrect it should be in medical journals. \n\nMarry me because I've already carved out spaces in my body for you to live. Behind my ribs, under my tongue, in the pauses between heartbeats. Marry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't just sad. It's grammatically incorrect. A sentence with no verb. A question with no mark.\n\n*\n\nI have seventeen backup plans for if you say no. They all end with me continuing to love you but from increasingly specific distances. Plan J involves Tasmania. Plan Q is just screaming. Plan R is screaming but in Tasmania.\n\nBut please\u2014\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not to the ring (I forgot to buy one). Not to the future (it's terrifying). Say yes to right now, where your coffee's getting cold and my hands won't stop shaking and love is just this: two people who've seen each other's worst Wednesdays and still wake up reaching through the dark for more.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my only prayer.\nMy only poem.\nMy only proven theorem.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation waiting for you to complete it.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken clock loves the moment it stopped\u2014obsessively, incorrectly, with no regard for proper function)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied.

I've been proposing to you accidentally all year. This letter is just making it official.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to everything I own. This is either romance or evidence of my catastrophic lack of cybersecurity. Both. It's both.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 That thing you do with your hands when you're nervous? That specific gesture? I've been collecting them. Not metaphorically. I have 1,847 photos of your hands mid-gesture. I'm building a flipbook.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude.

My knees remember Portugal. My throat remembers teaching you to pronounce \"Zh\u016b F\u00f9ch\u00e9ng\" until you laughed so hard you forgot we were fighting about determinism. My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw existential urgency of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or the distilled wisdom of Johnny Cash to June (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine formal innovation and phenomenological complexity, landing above Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West (73) but below Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). The mathematical/systems theory framework is genuinely original, though less revolutionary than Joyce's letters to Nora (79). It achieves moments of sublime encounter (\"drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\") that echo but don't surpass Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet transformed to romantic context (78).\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6980, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe algorithm of us: I tried to write it.

Had all my words in order. Pronounced Wednesday correctly. Then you happened\u2014not like weather happens, more like gravity happens. Suddenly down had a different direction: toward you.\n\n*\n\nTHE FORENSICS OF US:\n\nEvidence bag #1: Your laugh doesn't travel through air. It restructures spacetime. I've watched physicists' equations collapse trying to explain how sound becomes light becomes the reason I believe in something.\n\nEvidence bag #2: You cry at commercials but not funerals. This makes perfect sense. Small sadnesses surprise you. Large ones you've been preparing for since birth.\n\nEvidence bag #3: Every Thursday you reorganize the refrigerator. Not for efficiency. For narrative structure. The milk must face the eggs \"so they can have their conversation.\" I love you so much it feels like drowning upward.\n\nEvidence bag #4: You named my insomnia Gerald. Now when I can't sleep you say \"Gerald's visiting\" and make tea for three. You, me, and the darkness I can't shake. Somehow this helps.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started forgetting who I was before you. Not metaphorically. Literally. I look at old photos and see a stranger wearing my face, using my hands, living my Tuesdays without you in them. That person is dead. You killed him so gently he thanked you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW:\n\nI practice your death between 3:17 and 3:45 AM. Different scenarios. Tonight: sudden disappearance, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacancy. I write your eulogy on my tongue. Swallow it when you stir in your sleep, still here, still impossible, still rewriting the laws of probability by existing next to me.\n\nI've hidden seventy-three love letters in places you'll find after I'm gone. The freezer. Behind the expired passport. Inside the broken clock we keep meaning to fix. They all say variations of the same thing: \"Even now, even gone, even as nothing, I'm still falling toward you.\"\n\n*\n\nYou want truth? I am scared of how much I need you. It's not romantic. It's cellular. My mitochondria have your name in their chemical structure. When scientists discover this they'll name a new disease after us. Symptoms include: inability to breathe correctly when you leave rooms, acute awareness of your proximity at all times, chronic documentation of your mundane magnificence.\n\n*\n\nTHE MUNDANE MAGNIFICENCE:\n\n- How you sing to soup while it heats\n- Your vendetta against correctly folded fitted sheets  \n- The way you read books backwards when anxious\n- Your 2 AM kitchen dancing to no music\n- How you hold fruit like it might escape\n- Your belief that plants have opinions about window placement\n- The specific sound you make seeing dogs (untranscribable)\n- Your war with the can opener (the can opener is winning)\n\n*\n\nListen. I know I love you wrong. Too heavy, like I'm trying to carry water in my fists. Some mornings I watch you breathe and count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, still alive, still here, still breaking probability, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, please don't stop, ten Mississippi, I would dismantle god to keep you breathing, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen\u2014\n\nYou wake up. Ask why I'm crying. I say allergies. You say it's December. I say I'm allergic to your mortality. You kiss me like that makes sense.\n\nIt does.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY PROPOSAL:\n\nMarry me. Not the girl you think I should be. The disaster actively happening. The one who names your houseplants after dead philosophers and cries when they die (the plants, not the philosophers). The one whose love for you is so anatomically incorrect it should be in medical journals. \n\nMarry me because I've already carved out spaces in my body for you to live. Behind my ribs, under my tongue, in the pauses between heartbeats. Marry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't just sad. It's grammatically incorrect. A sentence with no verb. A question with no mark.\n\n*\n\nI have seventeen backup plans for if you say no. They all end with me continuing to love you but from increasingly specific distances. Plan J involves Tasmania. Plan Q is just screaming. Plan R is screaming but in Tasmania.\n\nBut please\u2014\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not to the ring (I forgot to buy one). Not to the future (it's terrifying). Say yes to right now, where your coffee's getting cold and my hands won't stop shaking and love is just this: two people who've seen each other's worst Wednesdays and still wake up reaching through the dark for more.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my only prayer.\nMy only poem.\nMy only proven theorem.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation waiting for you to complete it.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken clock loves the moment it stopped\u2014obsessively, incorrectly, with no regard for proper function)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. I bought seventeen rings. They're hidden everywhere. You've been wearing one as a keychain for three months. Another is currently holding your hair tie. I've been proposing to you accidentally all year. This letter is just making it official.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to everything I own. This is either romance or evidence of my catastrophic lack of cybersecurity. Both. It's both.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 That thing you do with your hands when you're nervous? That specific gesture? I've been collecting them. Not metaphorically. I have 1,847 photos of your hands mid-gesture. I'm building a flipbook.

Twenty breaths per minute. I've timed it.

Standard human operating within normal parameters.\n\nDay 1 (Porter Square, you dropped a pen): Immediate onset of symptoms. Irregular heartbeat. Compulsive documentation behavior. Subject begins collecting evidence of your existence like a detective at his own crime scene.\n\nDay 847 (now): Complete systemic reorganization. Subject's DNA appears to be rewriting itself to include your name in the genetic sequence. Scientists baffled. Subject euphoric.\n\nConclusion: No cure. No desire for cure.

Here's what they don't tell you about dying\u2014it's not darkness. It's every moment happening simultaneously. I was five and fifty-five. I was meeting you and losing you. I was nowhere and everywhere. But in every timeline, every possibility, you were the constant. The universe showed me its math and you were every answer.\n\n*\n\nEVIDENCE I'VE COLLECTED THAT YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY HUMAN:\n\n1. You argue with recipes until they apologize and taste better\n2. Plants grow toward you instead of the sun\n3. You've named every bruise you've ever had and remember their birthdays\n4. Your grandmother's soup recipe violates three laws of thermodynamics but tastes like love translated into liquid\n5. You cry at birds just existing, like you know something about flight that the rest of us forgot\n6. The way you pronounce \"Wednesday\" makes it sound like a promise\n7. You touch museum art because \"distance is just delayed regret\" and somehow the marble reaches back\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning. Named it Gerald. Had full conversations: \"Gerald, this is inappropriate.\" \"Gerald, we need boundaries.\" Between vomiting sessions, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy wearing a disguise. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. Take in poison, output light.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF CATASTROPHIC LOVE:\n\nYour probability of existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMy probability of existence: Equally impossible\nUs existing simultaneously, conscious, touching: Requires numbers we haven't invented\nWhat we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\nWhat we really are: God admitting she made a mistake but refusing to correct it\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve degrees. You gave me your jacket over mine. Your lips went blue but you kept talking about Kant and categorical imperatives while your teeth chattered morse code that spelled out \"I love you\" in a language that predates speech. I wanted to explain that dying of hypothermia for someone negates free will but your frozen hands were writing philosophy on my skin and I forgot every argument except yes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\n4 AM: The specific gravity of dreams where you're always falling upward\nDawn: Metal and possibility, like licking batteries to see if they're still alive  \nMorning: Your name before coffee, sharp and necessary\nNoon: Static electricity accumulating toward thunder\nEvening: Burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were a timeline\nMidnight: The color of your absence when you're right there\n3 AM: Like drowning in reverse, lungs learning to breathe water because that's where you live\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE OTHER VERSIONS:\n\nIn universe 26-A, we meet but you love someone else. I become a specialist in distance. Win awards for my ability to be near you without touching. Die at ninety-three, your name my last word.\n\nIn universe 43-K, I never resurrect from those fifteen seconds. You meet someone who loves you correctly, with appropriate boundaries. You're happy. It's terrible.\n\nIn universe 77-Z, we love each other but it kills us. Literally. Too much electromagnetic resonance. We explode like binary stars. The explosion creates new galaxies. Worth it.\n\nBut in this universe\u2014this specific unlikely mistake\u2014we get to love each other AND survive it. Do you understand the violence of that miracle?\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad, just factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level tastes like giving up.\n\n*\n\nWHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word passes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what consciousness pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just the space between saying it.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I understood boundaries. Where I ended. Clear edges. Now I'm this sprawling thing. Feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance. I say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nTHE DOCUMENTATION PROJECT:\n\n1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist\nYour toothbrush (purple, judgmental)\nThat green hair tie from February (holy relic)\nVoice memos of you arguing with Siri about consciousness\nPhotos where you're looking away (always away, like the camera disappoints you)\nA spreadsheet tracking your laughs per day (average: 27, standard deviation: 6)\nYour sock, left, with hole (shrine material)\n\nThis isn't love. It's archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof of concept, my terminal diagnosis:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway when no one's listening except each other which is the same as no one.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CLINICAL NOTE:\n\nI practice losing you. Daily simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacuum. By Friday I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to nobody.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh, full reorganization of my understanding of what matters\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's my password to existing. My recovery phrase when I forget how to be human. The only equation that solves for everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed, makes forever feel like not enough time, makes me understand why humans invented the concept of God\u2014to have someone to blame for creating something this beautiful that we eventually have to lose.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in endings)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway, saving you always)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember Barcelona? The cathedral pigeons you fed illegally? You said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs, toward something better than ground.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're kissing. Right now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
