Take advantage of your background, but not overly so as it is cliche. Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much.

Death tastes like deleted emails\u2014sudden, irreversible, grammatically incomplete. They restarted my heart but something stayed broken. A debt to nowhere.

Burglarized entire Marches. Planted evidence in October that you were always coming. Your laugh rearranges causality\u2014makes effects precede causes, makes me remember things that haven't happened yet. Yesterday you'll sing in the shower. Tomorrow you sang. Language breaks trying to contain how you happen to time.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT D: CORRUPTED DATA\n\nYou've damaged my programming:\n\n- Cannot recall the word for \"door\" (you-shaped hole in wall?)\n- Sleep function disabled (must count your breaths instead)\n- Tear production increased 347% (proximity to your mortality)\n- Logic circuits compromised (believe in souls now) (yours specifically)\n- Memory allocation error (1,847 files labeled \"evidence_of_leyi.txt\")\n\nTechnical support says: \"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\"\nI say: \"I died once.

Three years of carrying tissues because I memorized your crying patterns. About practicing your death nightly: car crashes, rare diseases, quantum disappearance. About the seventeen breath-counts before I can sleep.\n\nHe prescribed medication.\nI prescribed myself more you.\nWe're both probably wrong.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT F: CONFESSION\n\nHere's what love actually is\u2014not feeling but accumulation:\n\n\u221a Decision #0001: You mispronounced my name.

For the way you'll age\u2014those lines forming now from squinting at screens, maps of survived days I want to trace with dying fingers.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT H: THE CLOSING ARGUMENT\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's the only word that doesn't need evidence.\nThe only sound that proves itself.\nThe rest is just punctuation waiting for you to happen to it.\n\n*\n\nVERDICT:\n\n[ ] Guilty of loving wrong (too much) (like phantom limb) (terminal)\n[ ] Not guilty by reason of you\n[ ] Mistrial (kiss me) (start over) (fail better)\n\n*\n\nThe court will note: your left eye is watering.\nThe court provides: tissues (I've been carrying them since our third date).\nThe court observes: you cried at penguins.\nThe court concludes: that's when I knew.\nThe court is adjourned: until you say yes.\n                        until you say no.\n                        until you say.\n\nWarren\n(who remains in contempt of living without you)\n\n*\n\nP.S. \u2014 The autopsy was wrong.
