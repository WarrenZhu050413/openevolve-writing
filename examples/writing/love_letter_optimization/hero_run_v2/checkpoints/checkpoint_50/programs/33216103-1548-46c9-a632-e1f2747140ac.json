I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Now I understand infinity because it's the minimum unit for measuring what happens to my chest when you exist near me.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I've become a hoarder of microseconds. That pause before you sneeze. The 0.7 seconds your eyes take to find mine in crowds. How you hold chopsticks wrong but right. I'm building an illegal archive of moments the universe hasn't invoiced me for yet.\n\nWhen they ask me what religion I follow, I want to say: \"Tuesday, 9:47 PM, she fixed my collar without breaking conversation.\"\n\n*\n\nYou should know: I practice your absence like a piano piece I'll never master. 2 AM: What if car accident. 3 AM: What if rare disease. 4 AM: What if you wake up sane and realize I'm just a malfunction in a button-down shirt who writes your name in condensation on windows.\n\nBut then morning happens and you steal my coffee (always three sips, never four) and the doomsday scenarios dissolve because reality is so much stranger: you chose me. Keep choosing me. Despite evidence suggesting better options.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping receipts:\n\n- August 3rd: You called me during a panic attack. Not for comfort. To argue about pizza toppings. It worked.\n- September 15th: Found you teaching my grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost.\n- October 9th: You cried at a butterfly. Said \"it's trying so hard to fly.\" I knew then I'd marry you or die attempting.\n- November onwards: [CLASSIFIED - too dangerous for written record]\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: Mine was just transportation until you touched it. Now it's a conspiracy of cells that reorganize themselves toward you. My immune system has your name in its whitelist. My skeleton is biased in your direction. Even my allergies take breaks when you're laughing.\n\nSome nights I count your vertebrae like prayer beads. Twenty-four small gods holding you upright. I thank each one.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you are: Not metaphor. Not poetry. Evidence that sometimes the universe forgets to be cruel. You're what happens when atoms get ambitious. When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.\n\n*\n\nHere's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.\n\nBut then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Stay. Not because this letter is beautiful (it isn't). Not because I deserve you (I don't). But because your socks are already mixed with mine in ways that would take archaeologists to untangle. Because you know which nightmares require tea versus coffee. Because when you're gone, I have entire conversations with the dent you leave in the sofa.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is inadequate but \"you've fundamentally altered my molecular structure\" is too long for wedding vows.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Let me spend the next sixty years memorizing your disappointments. Learning your angers like a second language. Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.\n\nLet me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.\n\nLet me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- Times I've written this letter: 1,034\n- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  \n- Number of ways to say \"I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked\": Still counting\n- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first, like always. Here\u2014I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since the day I learned your tear patterns. Some people study astronomy. I studied you.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.
