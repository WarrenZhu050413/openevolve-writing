There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said \"this is stupid, you'll die.\" You said \"then I'll die warm\" and I understood: Love isn't feeling.

Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said \"I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively.\" The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure.

They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.\n\n*\n\nFirst equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat. Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:\n\n\u2014 The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM\n\u2014 Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)\n\u2014 That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine\n\u2014 The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence.

I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space. But sometimes atoms collide and make something impossible. Stars. DNA. Tuesday afternoons where you exist and know my name.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the collision that created everything else.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nI'll translate the silence. I've been studying your silences for 1,847 days.\n\nThis one means you're crying.\n\nLeft eye first.\n\nWarren\n(who's been carrying tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins and I realized my atoms had been waiting four billion years to hand you Kleenex)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the fifteen seconds.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty.

Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost.

Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much.

Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained.

When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.\n\n*\n\nHere's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.\n\nBut then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Stay.

We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes.

Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon.

You owe this.*\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually do: I run experiments on us\u2014\n\nTrial 47: Timed how long you hold your breath during sad movies (8.3 seconds average, 23 seconds during that scene with the dog).\n\nTrial 198: Documented your sleep positions. You curl counterclockwise, always counterclockwise, like you're unscrewing yourself from the day.\n\nTrial 659: Recorded you teaching my dead grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost. You bowed to her picture. My atheism cracked.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is pathology. I'm patient zero for something science hasn't named yet.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Sometimes I practice disasters. Write eulogies for versions of you that haven't died yet. Calculate how many Tuesdays remain if we're median lucky (2,137). The number makes me violent with gratitude and rage\u2014grateful for the Tuesdays, furious they're countable. I want to sue whoever invented mortality. I want to break into wherever they keep time and redistributre it. All of it. To us.\n\n*\n\nBut also this: Morocco. That night in Chefchaouen when you got food poisoning and I held your hair back while you negotiated with God in three languages. You looked up between retches and said \"still glad we came\" and I thought: *this is what holy means.* Not churches. Not prayers. Just someone vomiting blue city walls into existence and still choosing joy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014before you, I was symmetrical. Debugged. Now I'm this lopsided algorithm that processes everything through the question: \"Would Leyi laugh at this?\" My body lists toward yours even in different time zones. I've lost arguments with your Tuesday ghost, your Thursday ghost, the Sunday ghost who steals my Stanford hoodie and makes computer science finally mean something.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK. You cried at mathematical beauty in Newton's notebooks. Real tears for dead man's calculus. That's when I knew: You experience reality at a different resolution than the rest of us. Higher fidelity. More pixels per feeling. I want to study under your nervous system. Get my PhD in whatever makes you cry at equations and sing to broken coffee makers like they're just very tired and need encouragement.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven steps to make soup and you tear up at step thirty-three\u2014not onions, I've calibrated\u2014it's the exact moment her hands become yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. You stir counterclockwise. Always counterclockwise. Unscrewing yourself from grief, stirring yourself into continuation.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday, 3:47 AM. You were sleeping and said my name. Not romantically. Like answering roll call. Like: \"Present. Accounted for. Still here despite statistical improbability.\" I wanted to wake you and explain that you've made me religious but not about God\u2014about Tuesday mornings, about the way toast burns, about your specific frequency of existing.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. You tried to translate a poem about loss but gave up, said \"Some things don't survive the journey between languages.\" That's us. We don't translate. There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said \"this is stupid, you'll die.\" You said \"then I'll die warm\" and I understood: Love isn't feeling. It's a series of increasingly dangerous decisions you can't reverse. Like giving away your warmth. Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said \"I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively.\" The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup systems. If you go down, I don't reboot\u2014I just display error messages in languages that haven't been invented yet. I've tried to architect around this vulnerability. Can't. You're not a bug in my code. You're the operating system.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That terrible museum where you touched art you weren't supposed to touch and got us banned. You said \"How else do you know something's real?\" Your fingers on forbidden marble, testing reality's warranty. I think about those fingerprints still there, your DNA insisting on contact despite rules, despite time, despite the universe mostly being nothing touching nothing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe: Merge branch 'warren' into 'leyi'. Permanently. Not because this letter proves anything. Because your coffee mug already knows my kitchen. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all probable futures, the only one worth compiling is where you keep mispronouncing my name and I keep pretending to correct you.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing my bones to memorize your breathing pattern. The surgery to remove you would have to remove the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. You made me climb too many stairs at the Summer Palace and I complained until you kissed me at the top, said \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now I can't be at sea level without feeling like I'm disappointing gravity.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. Keeping me operational despite obvious design flaws.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or no. Or maybe. Or nothing.\n\nI'll keep writing this letter in every timeline until I find the one where you do.\n\nWarren\n(who learned Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet, who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014not even special pigeons, just regular ones existing\u2014who counts your breaths seventeen times per night because the alternative is believing in your mortality)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. It always does. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random, too random to be programmed. Too you to be anything else.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I still have your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. It lives in my desk drawer with other stolen proofs that you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
