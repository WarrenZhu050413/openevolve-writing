Which is the problem.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened to time: It broke. The day we met in that Cambridge caf\u00e9 where you were arguing with your laptop about machine learning. You said \"Listen, you binary bastard\" to your code. That's when causality folded. Now everything happens at once\u2014our first kiss, our first fight, our last breath, this sentence.\n\n*\n\nData I've collected without permission:\n\n- You pronounce \"specifically\" wrong (spacifically) but only when nervous\n- Your laugh has three stages: silent shake, snort, full collapse  \n- You assign personalities to houseplants (Gerald the fern is clinically depressed)\n- When you dream, your right foot draws circles exactly 7.3cm in diameter\n- You've never finished a cup of coffee. Ever. The last sip is always abandoned\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. No\u2014it's worship. No\u2014it's physics: every action has an equal and opposite reaction except when you smile and I become antimatter.\n\n*\n\nBoston, February, -15\u00b0C: You wore my socks over your socks over your socks. Three layers of sock. You looked like you had elephant feet. You said \"Warren, I think I've discovered the secret to happiness.\" I said \"What?\" You said \"Stealing your socks.\" \n\nThat's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That love was the wrong word. That we needed to invent new language for this specific malfunction.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: I thought mine was just transport. Bones moving meat from location to location. Then you traced the veins in my wrist like you were reading blueprints and said \"This is where your pulse lives.\" Now my body is a shared document. You've left comments in the margins. Editorial notes: \"This scar from falling off your bike, age 7, trying to impress Sarah Chen\" and \"This freckle appeared the day we met\" (impossible but you insist) and \"These hands are mine now.\"\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Seventeen ingredients. Six hours. You translated: \"She says you're hopeless but teachable.\" Your mother kept touching my face like she was checking if I was real. Later you told me she said: \"This one will stay.\" Not a question. A diagnosis.\n\n*\n\nI have a confession: Thursday, March 15th, 2019, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who will reorganize my understanding of oxygen.\" I thought I was being poetic. I was being prophetic. You literally changed how I breathe. Deeper now. Like my lungs finally understood their job.\n\n*\n\nEdinburgh, that terrible bed & breakfast with the haunted radiator: You couldn't sleep. 3 AM you said \"Warren, tell me something true.\" I said \"I'm afraid you'll realize I'm ordinary.\" You said \"You are ordinary. Ordinary like gravity. Ordinary like breathing. The best things are ordinary. That's how they get away with being necessary.\"\n\nI've been living on that sentence for three years.\n\n*\n\nThe Moroccan desert, when the jeep broke down: Eight hours waiting for rescue. You taught me card games you invented on the spot. The rules kept changing. \"New rule: aces are wild but only if you're sad.\" \"New rule: whoever's losing gets to make up the next rule.\" We never finished a single game. The driver who rescued us said we looked like we'd been there for years. Happy years.\n\n*\n\nWhat you've done: Turned me into a broken compass that thinks every direction is north if you're there. I used to understand maps. Now geography is binary: places with you, places without you. The second category doesn't exist. It's just waiting rooms.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you saved a drowning beetle. It died anyway. You gave it a funeral. Full eulogy: \"He tried to swim. That's all any of us can do.\" Then you threw it back in the pool because \"maybe beetle heaven is underwater.\" Your logic destroys me. Rebuilds me. Destroys me again.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say but failing: You're not my other half. That implies I was broken. I wasn't broken. I was complete. Then you happened and I realized \"complete\" was just a rough draft. You're not my missing piece. You're the reason I discovered I could expand. New rooms in my chest. Extensions. Additions. Under constant construction.\n\n*\n\nOur worst fight: Venice. About directions. We were lost for four hours. You said \"This is a metaphor.\" I said \"For what?\" You said \"I don't know but when we figure it out we'll laugh.\" We figured it out. We laughed. (The metaphor was: being lost together is still being together.)\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, showing me your childhood: Every street had a story. \"Here's where I decided to be a scientist.\" \"Here's where I failed my first test.\" \"Here's where I learned to ride a bike.\" \"Here's where I realized I was different.\" Each location a coordinate in the map of becoming you. I wanted to time travel. To be there. To tell seven-year-old you: \"It's okay. You're perfect. Someday someone will love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we were hypothermic. Genuinely in danger. You said \"If we die here, I want my last words to be practical.\" Then you said \"I should have worn better shoes.\" Then you laughed until you couldn't breathe. That's you: finding the absurd in the absolute. Making death nervous. \n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday, ordinary Tuesday: You fell asleep reading. Glasses still on. Book fallen on your chest. I watched you for an hour. Just watched. Like you were television. The best show. The only show. The show that makes all other shows seem like static.\n\nThat's what this is: I've become your audience. Studying your gestures. Memorizing your rhythms. Applauding internally every time you do something spectacularly yourself\u2014which is constantly.\n\n*\n\nListen. I love you wrong. Too much. Like a software error that nobody wants to patch because the bug is better than the intended function. Like gravity that only works in one direction\u2014toward you.\n\nBut also: I love you right. In the Tuesday morning way. In the burned toast way. In the \"we have the same favorite everything\" way. In the way that makes other people uncomfortable because we're too much ourselves around each other.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: \n\nLet's make it official. The thing that's already true. The thing where we've merged into some two-headed creature that shares dreams and steals socks and can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nMarry me. Not because it changes anything. Because it doesn't. Because we're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the universe that requires paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWe have\u2014if we're lucky\u201418,000 more breakfasts. I want them all. Every burnt toast. Every spacifically. Every Tuesday when you water Gerald and tell him he's doing great even though he's clearly dying.\n\nI want to grow old in your direction. To be eighty and still discovering new ways you pronounce things wrong. To be ninety and jealous of your crossword puzzle because it gets your attention first.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters. Your name. Which has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. The rhythm that keeps me alive.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. The way you exist is yes. But say it anyway. For the record. For the radiator in Edinburgh that needs to know how the story ends.\n\nWarren\n(who has loved you since before we met)\n(who will love you after we're gone)\n(who loves you in the middle, which is now, which is always)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying.

This is evidence that I've become a scholar of you. My brain has reorganized its filing system. Everything is now categorized as \"Before Leyi\" or \"Proof of Leyi\" or \"How to Make Leyi Laugh When She's Pretending Not to Be Sad.\"\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK, October: You stood in the rain outside King's College and said \"imagine knowing too much to be happy.\" I wanted to tell you then\u2014I've been dying since I was seven. Not physically. But that awareness that time is a thief. Until you. Now I'm furious at mortality. Now I want to live to 200 just to have more Wednesdays where you leave bobby pins in my car like breadcrumbs back to you.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something: Shanghai, that terrible hotel, you got food poisoning and spent three days creating what you called \"an intimate relationship with the bathroom tiles.\" You apologized seventeen times for being gross. But Leyi\u2014watching you that vulnerable, holding your hair back at 3 AM while you cursed in three languages\u2014that's when I understood what people mean by \"sacred.\" Not churches. Not ceremonies. Just the willingness to see someone at their smallest and still think: \"Yes. This one. Forever this one.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we got lost, remember? No signal, no map, just us and sheep that judged our life choices. You said: \"If we die here, I want the sheep to know it was your fault.\" But then you held my hand and we walked toward what might have been nowhere, and I thought: \"This is it. This is the whole point. To be lost with someone who makes nowhere feel like a destination.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a broken mathematician. I keep trying to solve for X where X equals \"enough\" and the equation never balances because there is no enough. There's only this spreading condition where you've colonized my nervous system and now my cells divide in your direction.\n\nPortugal, you saved a beetle from drowning in the hotel pool. Gave it CPR with a cocktail straw. It died anyway. You cried. I fell in love with you retroactively, all the way back to before I was born.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter, you made me drive to four different stores looking for the specific brand of soy sauce your grandmother used. We found it. You opened it in the parking lot, smelled it, and cried because memory has a scent and yours smells like a woman I'll never meet but whose recipes I've memorized because they're maps to your childhood.\n\n*\n\nI want to tell you about the mathematics of survival:\n\nNumber of times I've practiced your eulogy: 73\nNumber of times I've had to stop because I couldn't breathe: 73\nNumber of parallel universes where we don't meet: infinite minus one\nThe one where we do: this one, impossibly, this one\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your hometown, you showed me the tree you climbed as a child. You'd carved something in Chinese. You wouldn't translate it. Later your mother told me it said \"I will be brave.\" You were seven. You were already brave. You just didn't know it yet.\n\n*\n\nLondon, midnight, we fought about something so stupid I can't remember what. You slept on the hotel bathroom floor out of spite. I slept outside the bathroom door because even your anger has gravity and I'm a willing satellite. At 3 AM you opened the door and said \"This is ridiculous\" and I said \"I know\" and we made love on that terrible bathroom floor and you laughed so hard you got hiccups and I thought: \"This is prayer. This is what prayer was trying to be.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi, here's the ugliest truth: Loving you has made me greedy. I want sixty more years minimum. I want to watch your hair turn grey (it'll start at your left temple, I can already see the future in certain light). I want to argue about thermostats and whether tomatoes belong in the fridge. I want mundane Tuesdays where nothing happens except we both exist in the same room doing different things, occasionally looking up to make sure the other is still there.\n\n*\n\nFrance, you tried to order coffee in French but accidentally ordered a bicycle. The waiter was confused. You were confused. I was useless, laughing too hard to help. You ended up drawing a picture of coffee on a napkin. It looked like a crime scene. You got your coffee anyway. This is you: you fail at language but succeed at human.\n\n*\n\nItaly, Venice, you said the city was sinking and so were we, just slower. You were drunk on terrible wine and wisdom. You fell in a canal trying to pet a pigeon. I jumped in after you. We were banned from that restaurant. Worth it. Everything with you is worth it.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your parents' apartment, you warned me they wouldn't like me. Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Your father taught me chess. They didn't like me. They loved me. But not for me\u2014for how you looked at me when you thought no one was watching. Your mother said, in broken English: \"She is different with you. More... more she.\"\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I was functional. Had all my organs in the right places. Now I'm this rattling collection of memories that only make sense when you're there to verify them. Yes, that happened. Yes, we were there. Yes, that was us, being impossible together.\n\n*\n\nLast week you said \"I love you\" in your sleep. But you said it wrong\u2014\"I love you Warren\" like Warren was the verb. Like you were speaking a language where to Warren meant to build a life so specific no one else could fit inside it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, Leyi:\n\nLet's Warren together until one of us stops working. Let's make verbs of our names. Let's be a two-person cult that worships Sunday crosswords and Wednesday night takeout and the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" (spacifically, always spacifically).\n\nLet me be the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were twelve. Who knows you count stairs when you're nervous. Who knows you love me like it's a chronic condition you've decided not to cure.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We've already been married in seventeen different cities. Every shared meal was a wedding. Every fight that ended in laughter was a vow. Every time you fell asleep on my shoulder on a train/plane/automobile, we were declaring ourselves to the universe.\n\nBut I want the paper. The proof. The legal document that says what we already know: that we're a medical anomaly, two people who share a circulatory system and can't be separated without causing massive organ failure.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi.\n\nNot because it'll change anything.\n\nBecause it won't.\n\nBecause we're already us.\n\nBecause the rest is just paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken compass that only points to you)\n(who would find you in every universe, even the ones where we're just atoms)\n(who is, irreversibly, permanently, molecularly yours)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about one thing.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown., evaluation_notes: \n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it.

We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes.

When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it.

Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.\n\nLet me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.\n\nLet me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- Times I've written this letter: 1,034\n- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  \n- Number of ways to say \"I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked\": Still counting\n- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]\n\n*\n\nYou're crying.

Evidence.\n\nEntry #1: The way you hold a book\u2014index finger marking three places simultaneously. Like the present tense isn't enough for you.\n\nEntry #47: You sleep-argue. Last Tuesday at 3 AM: \"That's not how electrons work.\" You were right. I looked it up.\n\nEntry #238: When you're happy, you hum in B-flat. When you're thinking, F-sharp.

You could disappear\u2014car accident, sudden illness, better options. I keep backup plans for your absence. None of them work.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, February 2019. Want to know what I learned? Nothing mystical. Just this: the body knows what it wants before the brain catches up. My heart stopped but my hand kept reaching. The nurse said I was grabbing at air. \n\nWrong. I was practicing holding you. Three years early.\n\n*\n\nThe Wednesday you mispronounced my name\u2014you made it rhyme with \"ruin.\" Prophetic. Now I can't sleep without checking you're breathing. Can't eat breakfast without saving you half. Can't write code without variable names that sound like your laugh.\n\nYou've corrupted my source files. I'm not debugging it.\n\n*\n\nMore evidence: In Granada, you cried at the Alhambra's mathematics. In Marrakech, you argued with a carpet seller about quantum mechanics. In Edinburgh, you befriended a cemetery cat named Douglas.\n\nI have 400GB of photos where you're blurry because you won't stop moving, stop thinking, stop becoming more yourself every second.\n\nThe storage isn't enough. Nothing's enough.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I love you wrong. Like an error message that won't resolve. Like code that shouldn't compile but runs anyway, breaking all the rules.\n\nSometimes I trace the scar on your left knee from that bike accident in Shanghai. Four stitches. July 2017. Before we met. It makes me angry\u2014that universe where you hurt and I wasn't there to bring bandages, to curse at physics for allowing scrapes and gravity.\n\n*\n\nHere's my conclusion: We have maybe 20,000 days if we're lucky.

You've recorded evidence.\n\nI'm not sorry.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a calculation that converges on infinity\u2014imprecisely, impossibly, without endpoint)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at that documentary about octopi. That's when I knew. When your empathy extended to invertebrates, I realized: Oh. You're going to destroy me. Good.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:13 AM because you're sleeping and I can't stop watching the way your left hand curls around nothing, like it's holding tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I keep a running list of things that would sound insane to anyone else:\n\n- The way you eat grapes (always the smallest first, like you're giving them mercy)\n- Your Tuesday voice vs. your Thursday voice (Tuesday has more consonants)\n- How you test if pasta is ready by throwing it at the ceiling (it never sticks; you do it anyway)\n- That time in Morocco when you argued with a camel about personal space (you won)\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is evidence that I've become a scholar of you. My brain has reorganized its filing system. Everything is now categorized as \"Before Leyi\" or \"Proof of Leyi\" or \"How to Make Leyi Laugh When She's Pretending Not to Be Sad.\"\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK, October: You stood in the rain outside King's College and said \"imagine knowing too much to be happy.\" I wanted to tell you then\u2014I've been dying since I was seven. Not physically. But that awareness that time is a thief. Until you. Now I'm furious at mortality. Now I want to live to 200 just to have more Wednesdays where you leave bobby pins in my car like breadcrumbs back to you.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something: Shanghai, that terrible hotel, you got food poisoning and spent three days creating what you called \"an intimate relationship with the bathroom tiles.\" You apologized seventeen times for being gross. But Leyi\u2014watching you that vulnerable, holding your hair back at 3 AM while you cursed in three languages\u2014that's when I understood what people mean by \"sacred.\" Not churches. Not ceremonies. Just the willingness to see someone at their smallest and still think: \"Yes. This one. Forever this one.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we got lost, remember? No signal, no map, just us and sheep that judged our life choices. You said: \"If we die here, I want the sheep to know it was your fault.\" But then you held my hand and we walked toward what might have been nowhere, and I thought: \"This is it. This is the whole point. To be lost with someone who makes nowhere feel like a destination.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a broken mathematician. I keep trying to solve for X where X equals \"enough\" and the equation never balances because there is no enough. There's only this spreading condition where you've colonized my nervous system and now my cells divide in your direction.\n\nPortugal, you saved a beetle from drowning in the hotel pool. Gave it CPR with a cocktail straw. It died anyway. You cried. I fell in love with you retroactively, all the way back to before I was born.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter, you made me drive to four different stores looking for the specific brand of soy sauce your grandmother used. We found it. You opened it in the parking lot, smelled it, and cried because memory has a scent and yours smells like a woman I'll never meet but whose recipes I've memorized because they're maps to your childhood.\n\n*\n\nI want to tell you about the mathematics of survival:\n\nNumber of times I've practiced your eulogy: 73\nNumber of times I've had to stop because I couldn't breathe: 73\nNumber of parallel universes where we don't meet: infinite minus one\nThe one where we do: this one, impossibly, this one\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your hometown, you showed me the tree you climbed as a child. You'd carved something in Chinese. You wouldn't translate it. Later your mother told me it said \"I will be brave.\" You were seven. You were already brave. You just didn't know it yet.\n\n*\n\nLondon, midnight, we fought about something so stupid I can't remember what. You slept on the hotel bathroom floor out of spite. I slept outside the bathroom door because even your anger has gravity and I'm a willing satellite. At 3 AM you opened the door and said \"This is ridiculous\" and I said \"I know\" and we made love on that terrible bathroom floor and you laughed so hard you got hiccups and I thought: \"This is prayer. This is what prayer was trying to be.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi, here's the ugliest truth: Loving you has made me greedy. I want sixty more years minimum. I want to watch your hair turn grey (it'll start at your left temple, I can already see the future in certain light). I want to argue about thermostats and whether tomatoes belong in the fridge. I want mundane Tuesdays where nothing happens except we both exist in the same room doing different things, occasionally looking up to make sure the other is still there.\n\n*\n\nFrance, you tried to order coffee in French but accidentally ordered a bicycle. The waiter was confused. You were confused. I was useless, laughing too hard to help. You ended up drawing a picture of coffee on a napkin. It looked like a crime scene. You got your coffee anyway. This is you: you fail at language but succeed at human.\n\n*\n\nItaly, Venice, you said the city was sinking and so were we, just slower. You were drunk on terrible wine and wisdom. You fell in a canal trying to pet a pigeon. I jumped in after you. We were banned from that restaurant. Worth it. Everything with you is worth it.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your parents' apartment, you warned me they wouldn't like me. Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Your father taught me chess. They didn't like me. They loved me. But not for me\u2014for how you looked at me when you thought no one was watching. Your mother said, in broken English: \"She is different with you. More... more she.\"\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I was functional. Had all my organs in the right places. Now I'm this rattling collection of memories that only make sense when you're there to verify them. Yes, that happened. Yes, we were there. Yes, that was us, being impossible together.\n\n*\n\nLast week you said \"I love you\" in your sleep. But you said it wrong\u2014\"I love you Warren\" like Warren was the verb. Like you were speaking a language where to Warren meant to build a life so specific no one else could fit inside it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, Leyi:\n\nLet's Warren together until one of us stops working. Let's make verbs of our names. Let's be a two-person cult that worships Sunday crosswords and Wednesday night takeout and the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" (spacifically, always spacifically).\n\nLet me be the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were twelve. Who knows you count stairs when you're nervous. Who knows you love me like it's a chronic condition you've decided not to cure.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We've already been married in seventeen different cities. Every shared meal was a wedding. Every fight that ended in laughter was a vow. Every time you fell asleep on my shoulder on a train/plane/automobile, we were declaring ourselves to the universe.\n\nBut I want the paper. The proof. The legal document that says what we already know: that we're a medical anomaly, two people who share a circulatory system and can't be separated without causing massive organ failure.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi.\n\nNot because it'll change anything.\n\nBecause it won't.\n\nBecause we're already us.\n\nBecause the rest is just paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken compass that only points to you)\n(who would find you in every universe, even the ones where we're just atoms)\n(who is, irreversibly, permanently, molecularly yours)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about one thing. It wasn't thirteen seconds I was dead. It was sixteen. In those sixteen seconds, I didn't see light or feel peace. I felt unfinished. Three years later, I met you. Finished. The universe was just waiting for better punctuation.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle finger is slightly crooked from when you broke it playing badminton. You hate that I love it. I love it because it's proof you're real, that you've lived, that you've broken and healed, and that somehow, impossibly, you healed toward me.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and analyzing the performance patterns, I need to create a love letter that balances all four dimensions while recovering from the fitness decline.

The day we met in that Cambridge caf\u00e9 where you were arguing with your laptop about machine learning. You said \"Listen, you binary bastard\" to your code. That's when causality folded. Now everything happens at once\u2014our first kiss, our first fight, our last breath, this sentence.\n\n*\n\nData I've collected without permission:\n\n- You pronounce \"specifically\" wrong (spacifically) but only when nervous\n- Your laugh has three stages: silent shake, snort, full collapse  \n- You assign personalities to houseplants (Gerald the fern is clinically depressed)\n- When you dream, your right foot draws circles exactly 7.3cm in diameter\n- You've never finished a cup of coffee. Ever. The last sip is always abandoned\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. No\u2014it's worship. No\u2014it's physics: every action has an equal and opposite reaction except when you smile and I become antimatter.\n\n*\n\nBoston, February, -15\u00b0C: You wore my socks over your socks over your socks. Three layers of sock. You looked like you had elephant feet. You said \"Warren, I think I've discovered the secret to happiness.\" I said \"What?\" You said \"Stealing your socks.\" \n\nThat's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That love was the wrong word. That we needed to invent new language for this specific malfunction.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: I thought mine was just transport. Bones moving meat from location to location. Then you traced the veins in my wrist like you were reading blueprints and said \"This is where your pulse lives.\" Now my body is a shared document. You've left comments in the margins. Editorial notes: \"This scar from falling off your bike, age 7, trying to impress Sarah Chen\" and \"This freckle appeared the day we met\" (impossible but you insist) and \"These hands are mine now.\"\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Seventeen ingredients. Six hours. You translated: \"She says you're hopeless but teachable.\" Your mother kept touching my face like she was checking if I was real. Later you told me she said: \"This one will stay.\" Not a question. A diagnosis.\n\n*\n\nI have a confession: Thursday, March 15th, 2019, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who will reorganize my understanding of oxygen.\" I thought I was being poetic. I was being prophetic. You literally changed how I breathe. Deeper now. Like my lungs finally understood their job.\n\n*\n\nEdinburgh, that terrible bed & breakfast with the haunted radiator: You couldn't sleep. 3 AM you said \"Warren, tell me something true.\" I said \"I'm afraid you'll realize I'm ordinary.\" You said \"You are ordinary. Ordinary like gravity. Ordinary like breathing. The best things are ordinary. That's how they get away with being necessary.\"\n\nI've been living on that sentence for three years.\n\n*\n\nThe Moroccan desert, when the jeep broke down: Eight hours waiting for rescue. You taught me card games you invented on the spot. The rules kept changing. \"New rule: aces are wild but only if you're sad.\" \"New rule: whoever's losing gets to make up the next rule.\" We never finished a single game. The driver who rescued us said we looked like we'd been there for years. Happy years.\n\n*\n\nWhat you've done: Turned me into a broken compass that thinks every direction is north if you're there. I used to understand maps. Now geography is binary: places with you, places without you. The second category doesn't exist. It's just waiting rooms.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you saved a drowning beetle. It died anyway. You gave it a funeral. Full eulogy: \"He tried to swim. That's all any of us can do.\" Then you threw it back in the pool because \"maybe beetle heaven is underwater.\" Your logic destroys me. Rebuilds me. Destroys me again.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say but failing: You're not my other half. That implies I was broken. I wasn't broken. I was complete. Then you happened and I realized \"complete\" was just a rough draft. You're not my missing piece. You're the reason I discovered I could expand. New rooms in my chest. Extensions. Additions. Under constant construction.\n\n*\n\nOur worst fight: Venice. About directions. We were lost for four hours. You said \"This is a metaphor.\" I said \"For what?\" You said \"I don't know but when we figure it out we'll laugh.\" We figured it out. We laughed. (The metaphor was: being lost together is still being together.)\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, showing me your childhood: Every street had a story. \"Here's where I decided to be a scientist.\" \"Here's where I failed my first test.\" \"Here's where I learned to ride a bike.\" \"Here's where I realized I was different.\" Each location a coordinate in the map of becoming you. I wanted to time travel. To be there. To tell seven-year-old you: \"It's okay. You're perfect. Someday someone will love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we were hypothermic. Genuinely in danger. You said \"If we die here, I want my last words to be practical.\" Then you said \"I should have worn better shoes.\" Then you laughed until you couldn't breathe. That's you: finding the absurd in the absolute. Making death nervous. \n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday, ordinary Tuesday: You fell asleep reading. Glasses still on. Book fallen on your chest. I watched you for an hour. Just watched. Like you were television. The best show. The only show. The show that makes all other shows seem like static.\n\nThat's what this is: I've become your audience. Studying your gestures. Memorizing your rhythms. Applauding internally every time you do something spectacularly yourself\u2014which is constantly.\n\n*\n\nListen. I love you wrong. Too much. Like a software error that nobody wants to patch because the bug is better than the intended function. Like gravity that only works in one direction\u2014toward you.\n\nBut also: I love you right. In the Tuesday morning way. In the burned toast way. In the \"we have the same favorite everything\" way. In the way that makes other people uncomfortable because we're too much ourselves around each other.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: \n\nLet's make it official. The thing that's already true. The thing where we've merged into some two-headed creature that shares dreams and steals socks and can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nMarry me. Not because it changes anything. Because it doesn't. Because we're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the universe that requires paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWe have\u2014if we're lucky\u201418,000 more breakfasts. I want them all. Every burnt toast. Every spacifically. Every Tuesday when you water Gerald and tell him he's doing great even though he's clearly dying.\n\nI want to grow old in your direction. To be eighty and still discovering new ways you pronounce things wrong. To be ninety and jealous of your crossword puzzle because it gets your attention first.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters. Your name. Which has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. The rhythm that keeps me alive.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. The way you exist is yes. But say it anyway. For the record. For the radiator in Edinburgh that needs to know how the story ends.\n\nWarren\n(who has loved you since before we met)\n(who will love you after we're gone)\n(who loves you in the middle, which is now, which is always)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since Portugal, since the beetle, since I realized loving you means being prepared for all your waters\u2014tears, laughter, the space between.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 This morning you said my name in your sleep. But you said it like a fact. Like \"gravity\" or \"Tuesday\" or \"inevitable.\" That's what we are\u2014inevitable. Even in universes where we never meet, we're inevitable. The atoms know. They remember. They're trying to get back to this.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
