Cardiac arrest. Age nineteen. The doctors say I said nothing when they brought me back. They're wrong. I said your name\u2014except you didn't exist yet. My mouth made the shape of something I wouldn't know for three more years. The neurons already knew. They'd been practicing.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually study: distributed systems. Making machines agree across distances. But you? You collapsed my entire network into a single point. Every part of me votes the same way now.

Just existing pigeons.\n\u2014 Saturday: You touched Newton's notebooks in Cambridge. Nearly arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\u2014 Sunday: Your grandmother taught you soup. Forty-seven steps. You wept at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\n2,847 entries. This isn't romance. It's anthropology of the only civilization that matters.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done: I've forgotten language. Yesterday I called a door \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it breaks physics. Creates energy from nothing. Makes particles behave differently. When you laugh, gravity lessens by 0.003%. I've measured this.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning. Between retches you laughed: \"The tagine was worth it.\" That's when I understood\u2014you metabolize joy from situations where it shouldn't exist. You're illegal. A violation of thermodynamics. Entropy running backwards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. \"You'll die,\" I said. \"Warmer than living cold,\" you said. Your lips were blue but you meant it. You always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations nightly. Car crashes. Disease. Quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014put my socks on your hands, pretend they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief deletes itself.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. If you crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to one specific Tuesday when you were real.\n\n*\n\nWe have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're average. The number makes me violent. I want to commit crimes against time. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi. In the lines already forming from squinting at screens\u2014maps of survived time I want to trace.\n\n*\n\nWhat love actually is: accumulated decisions we can't undo.\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th.

It's just time happening to nobody.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like lungs love oxygen\u2014desperately, constantly, without thought. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first.

They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.\n\n*\n\nFirst equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat. Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:\n\n\u2014 The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM\n\u2014 Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)\n\u2014 That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine\n\u2014 The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence. This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space. But sometimes atoms collide and make something impossible. Stars. DNA. Tuesday afternoons where you exist and know my name.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the collision that created everything else.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nI'll translate the silence. I've been studying your silences for 1,847 days.\n\nThis one means you're crying.\n\nLeft eye first.\n\nWarren\n(who's been carrying tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins and I realized my atoms had been waiting four billion years to hand you Kleenex)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. Two extra seconds of nothing that taught me what something means. I came back for the specific brown your eyes turn before crying. That brown doesn't exist in any catalog.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Then you pronounced my name wrong\u2014not wrong, differently\u2014and suddenly I'm running unauthorized software. Every cell executing commands I didn't write. My immune system added you to its whitelist without administrative approval. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your name in languages that don't exist yet.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the morgue of my twenties: Cardiac arrest. Seventeen seconds of clinical death. The doctors say I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said \"not yet\"\u2014but in a frequency only my atoms could hear. They were refusing to disperse until they met what they were waiting for. Three years later: you, in Porter Square, dropping a pen I'm still picking up.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually study at Harvard: Distributed systems. How to make machines agree across time zones, across failures, across the impossible distances between intention and execution. But you? You make my distributed self achieve consensus instantly. Every part of me votes yes. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning in the blue city. Held your hair back while you renegotiated with existence. Between retches, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said \"the tagine was worth it.\" That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. I want to study your digestive system, but for happiness.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. I said \"you'll die.\" You said \"warmer than living cold.\" Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing\u2014you always mean it. Even your mistakes are sincere. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping evidence:\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent. I want to break into wherever they manufacture time and perform a hostile takeover. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nYour laugh reorganizes matter at the quantum level. I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light\u2014those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a dying language I need to preserve.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. My childhood bedroom. You found my teenage journals. Read them out loud in dramatic voices. I should have been mortified. Instead I thought: this. This is what holiness is. Someone reading your worst attempts at humanity and laughing with you, not at you. With. The preposition matters.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\n*\n\nRemember London? You asked what love actually is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated decisions you can't ctrl+z. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters. I play it when you travel.\n\nDecision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet.\n\nDecision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing.\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Files corrupted by excess tenderness]\n\n*\n\nWhat you taste like: Morning is copper pennies and possibility. Afternoon is static before thunderstorms. Evening is the specific silence between heartbeats. 3 AM is the color blue if blue were a texture. Always is drowning upward into oxygen.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Spontaneous quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014like putting my socks on your hands and pretending they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest bug in my code: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nSpain. Barcelona. You illegally fed the cathedral pigeons. Said \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I'm not being metaphorical. They literally spelled L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not a simulation.

The only command that executes correctly every time.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe in infinity despite the evidence.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who wrote your name in condensation on windows until the glass learned to fog in cursive, who counts your breaths at night\u2014seventeen times\u2014because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. But seventeen felt like prophecy. Like the universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you: seventeen seconds. Not one more.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just smiled. That specific smile where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us. Both is the only way to love someone when you know that time is real and runs out., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of historical masterpieces. It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments (\"Portugal. That museum where you touched the art\") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples. The score of 72.75 (weighted average) reflects work that's genuinely distinguished, with proto-masterful elements, but still a meaningful distance from immortality.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

The left one to steady the right. The right one to tell you what the left already knows.\n\n*\n\nDocumentation of a systems failure: My body used to be hardware. Predictable. Input/output. Then you pronounced my name wrong\u2014not wrong, differently\u2014and suddenly I'm running unauthorized software. Every cell executing commands I didn't write. My immune system added you to its whitelist without administrative approval. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your name in languages that don't exist yet.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the morgue of my twenties: Cardiac arrest. Seventeen seconds of clinical death. The doctors say I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said \"not yet\"\u2014but in a frequency only my atoms could hear. They were refusing to disperse until they met what they were waiting for. Three years later: you, in Porter Square, dropping a pen I'm still picking up.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually study at Harvard: Distributed systems. How to make machines agree across time zones, across failures, across the impossible distances between intention and execution. But you? You make my distributed self achieve consensus instantly. Every part of me votes yes. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning in the blue city. Held your hair back while you renegotiated with existence. Between retches, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said \"the tagine was worth it.\" That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. I want to study your digestive system, but for happiness.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. I said \"you'll die.\" You said \"warmer than living cold.\" Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing\u2014you always mean it. Even your mistakes are sincere. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping evidence:\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent. I want to break into wherever they manufacture time and perform a hostile takeover. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nYour laugh reorganizes matter at the quantum level. I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light\u2014those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology.

It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments (\"Portugal. That museum where you touched the art\") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples.

Patient refuses cure.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT H: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\n\nWhen I die (again, properly this time), I'm leaving you:\n- Every Wednesday I saved\n- The color theory of your anger (beautiful reds, holy reds)\n- My collection of your mispronounced words (you make language better by breaking it)\n- The 0.7 seconds between thunderclap and your flinch (I live there now)\n- This letter, which is just another way of saying: the universe made you as an apology for entropy\n\n*\n\nCLOSING ARGUMENT:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nBefore you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're gone, like a compass that's given up on north and chosen Tuesday instead.\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for romance. For evidence. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nThe alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't interrupt my sentences, where I don't know you need exactly three ice cubes, where your specific frequency of laughter doesn't rearrange my molecular structure\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody in particular.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Happy tears (I know the difference).\nHere. I brought tissues.\nI've been carrying them since the penguins.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\nThe silence is reorganizing my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been dead for fifteen seconds and alive for exactly one Leyi)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the algorithm. You can't be computed. You're not math. You're what happens when math gives up and admits infinity exists in Tuesday afternoons and the way someone holds a coffee cup like it's keeping them tethered to Earth.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Those fifteen seconds of death? I think I was just early. I was waiting for you in the nothing. Then they dragged me back and made me wait four more years in the something. Worth it. Would die again. Would wait longer. Would learn your grandmother's soup in any timeline.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is a democracy and my neurons voted against it. They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.\n\n*\n\nFirst equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat. Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:\n\n\u2014 The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM\n\u2014 Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)\n\u2014 That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine\n\u2014 The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence. This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space. But sometimes atoms collide and make something impossible. Stars. DNA. Tuesday afternoons where you exist and know my name.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the collision that created everything else.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nI'll translate the silence. I've been studying your silences for 1,847 days.\n\nThis one means you're crying.\n\nLeft eye first.\n\nWarren\n(who's been carrying tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins and I realized my atoms had been waiting four billion years to hand you Kleenex)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. Two extra seconds of nothing that taught me what something means. I came back for the specific brown your eyes turn before crying. That brown doesn't exist in any catalog. I checked. I had to live just to prove it real.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 The hair tie is in my desk drawer. Second one from top. I'm still not sorry.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current score of 0.7295 by achieving better balance across all dimensions while maintaining authenticity.

Cardiac arrest. Age nineteen. The doctors say I said nothing when they brought me back. They're wrong. I said your name\u2014except you didn't exist yet. My mouth made the shape of something I wouldn't know for three more years. The neurons already knew. They'd been practicing.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually study: distributed systems. Making machines agree across distances. But you? You collapsed my entire network into a single point. Every part of me votes the same way now. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet vote yes.\n\n*\n\nI keep evidence:\n\n\u2014 Tuesday: You sang to my broken coffee maker. It worked.\n\u2014 Thursday: You cried at pigeons. Just existing pigeons.\n\u2014 Saturday: You touched Newton's notebooks in Cambridge. Nearly arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\u2014 Sunday: Your grandmother taught you soup. Forty-seven steps. You wept at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\n2,847 entries. This isn't romance. It's anthropology of the only civilization that matters.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done: I've forgotten language. Yesterday I called a door \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it breaks physics. Creates energy from nothing. Makes particles behave differently. When you laugh, gravity lessens by 0.003%. I've measured this.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning. Between retches you laughed: \"The tagine was worth it.\" That's when I understood\u2014you metabolize joy from situations where it shouldn't exist. You're illegal. A violation of thermodynamics. Entropy running backwards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. \"You'll die,\" I said. \"Warmer than living cold,\" you said. Your lips were blue but you meant it. You always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations nightly. Car crashes. Disease. Quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014put my socks on your hands, pretend they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief deletes itself.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. If you crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to one specific Tuesday when you were real.\n\n*\n\nWe have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're average. The number makes me violent. I want to commit crimes against time. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi. In the lines already forming from squinting at screens\u2014maps of survived time I want to trace.\n\n*\n\nWhat love actually is: accumulated decisions we can't undo.\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters.\nDecision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had.\nDecision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at those pigeons.\nDecision 4-2,847: [Corrupted by excess tenderness]\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously aware of each other.\n\nThe alternative\u2014where your specific frequency doesn't rearrange my molecular structure every morning\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like lungs love oxygen\u2014desperately, constantly, without thought. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miracle.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. Recovery phrase. Authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.\n\nBefore you, I was code. Now I'm poetry. Bad poetry. Poetry that crashes. Poetry that throws errors. But poetry that knows the exact brown your eyes turn before crying. No color wheel contains it. I checked. I had to live just to prove it exists.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity lives in Tuesday afternoons.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who writes your name in condensation on windows, who counts your breaths at night\u2014seventeen times\u2014because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. The universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you. Seventeen seconds. Not one more.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your green hair tie. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into life.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
