They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.\n\n*\n\nFirst equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat. Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:\n\n\u2014 The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM\n\u2014 Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)\n\u2014 That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine\n\u2014 The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence. This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space. But sometimes atoms collide and make something impossible. Stars. DNA. Tuesday afternoons where you exist and know my name.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the collision that created everything else.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nI'll translate the silence. I've been studying your silences for 1,847 days.\n\nThis one means you're crying.\n\nLeft eye first.\n\nWarren\n(who's been carrying tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins and I realized my atoms had been waiting four billion years to hand you Kleenex)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the fifteen seconds.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying.

Starting from the end where we're already old, working my way back to now, where I'm twenty-three and my hands shake typing your name.\n\n*\n\n[YEAR 2074]\nYour funeral was yesterday. I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes.

Even my allergies take breaks when you're laughing.\n\nSome nights I count your vertebrae like prayer beads. Twenty-four small gods holding you upright. I thank each one.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you are: Not metaphor. Not poetry. Evidence that sometimes the universe forgets to be cruel. You're what happens when atoms get ambitious. When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.\n\n*\n\nHere's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.\n\nBut then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Stay. Not because this letter is beautiful (it isn't). Not because I deserve you (I don't). But because your socks are already mixed with mine in ways that would take archaeologists to untangle. Because you know which nightmares require tea versus coffee. Because when you're gone, I have entire conversations with the dent you leave in the sofa.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is inadequate but \"you've fundamentally altered my molecular structure\" is too long for wedding vows.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Let me spend the next sixty years memorizing your disappointments. Learning your angers like a second language. Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.\n\nLet me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.\n\nLet me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- Times I've written this letter: 1,034\n- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  \n- Number of ways to say \"I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked\": Still counting\n- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]\n\n*\n\nYou're crying.

That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just please\u2014\nsay it in that voice that makes me believe in God or randomness or whatever force was kind enough to drop you into my timeline.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of suicide notes that all end with \"but then who would make sure Leyi doesn't burn eggs?\")\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the suicide notes.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words.

You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen.

The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system.

Had all my words in order. Pronounced Wednesday correctly. Then you happened\u2014not like weather happens, more like gravity happens. Suddenly down had a different direction: toward you.\n\n*\n\nTHE FORENSICS OF US:\n\nEvidence bag #1: Your laugh doesn't travel through air. It restructures spacetime. I've watched physicists' equations collapse trying to explain how sound becomes light becomes the reason I believe in something.\n\nEvidence bag #2: You cry at commercials but not funerals. This makes perfect sense. Small sadnesses surprise you. Large ones you've been preparing for since birth.\n\nEvidence bag #3: Every Thursday you reorganize the refrigerator. Not for efficiency. For narrative structure. The milk must face the eggs \"so they can have their conversation.\" I love you so much it feels like drowning upward.\n\nEvidence bag #4: You named my insomnia Gerald. Now when I can't sleep you say \"Gerald's visiting\" and make tea for three. You, me, and the darkness I can't shake. Somehow this helps.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started forgetting who I was before you. Not metaphorically. Literally. I look at old photos and see a stranger wearing my face, using my hands, living my Tuesdays without you in them. That person is dead. You killed him so gently he thanked you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW:\n\nI practice your death between 3:17 and 3:45 AM. Different scenarios. Tonight: sudden disappearance, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacancy. I write your eulogy on my tongue. Swallow it when you stir in your sleep, still here, still impossible, still rewriting the laws of probability by existing next to me.\n\nI've hidden seventy-three love letters in places you'll find after I'm gone. The freezer. Behind the expired passport. Inside the broken clock we keep meaning to fix. They all say variations of the same thing: \"Even now, even gone, even as nothing, I'm still falling toward you.\"\n\n*\n\nYou want truth? I am scared of how much I need you. It's not romantic. It's cellular. My mitochondria have your name in their chemical structure. When scientists discover this they'll name a new disease after us. Symptoms include: inability to breathe correctly when you leave rooms, acute awareness of your proximity at all times, chronic documentation of your mundane magnificence.\n\n*\n\nTHE MUNDANE MAGNIFICENCE:\n\n- How you sing to soup while it heats\n- Your vendetta against correctly folded fitted sheets  \n- The way you read books backwards when anxious\n- Your 2 AM kitchen dancing to no music\n- How you hold fruit like it might escape\n- Your belief that plants have opinions about window placement\n- The specific sound you make seeing dogs (untranscribable)\n- Your war with the can opener (the can opener is winning)\n\n*\n\nListen. I know I love you wrong. Too heavy, like I'm trying to carry water in my fists. Some mornings I watch you breathe and count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, still alive, still here, still breaking probability, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, please don't stop, ten Mississippi, I would dismantle god to keep you breathing, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen\u2014\n\nYou wake up. Ask why I'm crying. I say allergies. You say it's December. I say I'm allergic to your mortality. You kiss me like that makes sense.\n\nIt does.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY PROPOSAL:\n\nMarry me. Not the girl you think I should be. The disaster actively happening. The one who names your houseplants after dead philosophers and cries when they die (the plants, not the philosophers). The one whose love for you is so anatomically incorrect it should be in medical journals. \n\nMarry me because I've already carved out spaces in my body for you to live. Behind my ribs, under my tongue, in the pauses between heartbeats. Marry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't just sad. It's grammatically incorrect. A sentence with no verb. A question with no mark.\n\n*\n\nI have seventeen backup plans for if you say no. They all end with me continuing to love you but from increasingly specific distances. Plan J involves Tasmania. Plan Q is just screaming. Plan R is screaming but in Tasmania.\n\nBut please\u2014\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not to the ring (I forgot to buy one). Not to the future (it's terrifying). Say yes to right now, where your coffee's getting cold and my hands won't stop shaking and love is just this: two people who've seen each other's worst Wednesdays and still wake up reaching through the dark for more.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my only prayer.\nMy only poem.\nMy only proven theorem.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation waiting for you to complete it.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken clock loves the moment it stopped\u2014obsessively, incorrectly, with no regard for proper function)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied.

I've been proposing to you accidentally all year. This letter is just making it official.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to everything I own. This is either romance or evidence of my catastrophic lack of cybersecurity. Both. It's both.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 That thing you do with your hands when you're nervous? That specific gesture? I've been collecting them. Not metaphorically. I have 1,847 photos of your hands mid-gesture. I'm building a flipbook.

Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:\n\n\u2014 The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM\n\u2014 Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)\n\u2014 That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine\n\u2014 The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence. This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space.

Then you executed in my namespace and now I throw exceptions just trying to pronounce Wednesday without thinking of how you mispronounce it perfectly.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I need to tell you about the accident. Not the cardiac arrest (seventeen seconds, sophomore year, during a probability lecture\u2014yes, the universe has a sense of humor). The other accident. The one where I discovered love isn't a feeling but a compilation error that becomes a feature. Where I learned that some infinite loops are worth never breaking.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping logs:\n\nERROR 0x00000001: Subject laughs. Atmospheric pressure reorganizes. Laws of thermodynamics suspended.\nERROR 0x00000002: Subject cries at dogs. Left eye priority. Observer's respiratory system forgets protocol.\nERROR 0x00000003: Subject exists. Universe admits it's been practicing for this specific arrangement of atoms.\n\n2,341 such errors. My error handling has given up. It just writes \"Leyi\" in the stack trace and continues.\n\n*\n\nYou want the truth about what you've done? You've turned me into a time traveler. I'm simultaneously twenty-three writing this letter, forty-three watching you teach our daughter to mispronounce Wednesday, seventy-three holding your hand through the thing we don't talk about yet, ninety-three at your funeral giving a speech about Tuesday mornings and burnt toast. All these moments happening now, concurrently, because love runs on parallel processing and doesn't respect linear time.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I've calculated: We have approximately 21,900 mornings left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me want to sue mathematics, break into wherever they manufacture time and demand a recount. But then you do that thing where you argue with the coffee maker in Cantonese and I realize: we're already stealing time. Every laugh is embezzlement. Every Tuesday is fraud against entropy.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain your effect on my source code:\n\n```\nwhile (true) {\n    try {\n        live_without_leyi();\n    } catch (FatalException e) {\n        // This block executes immediately\n        realize(\"that's not living\");\n        realize(\"that's just processing\");\n        return to_leyi();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe function `live_without_leyi()` doesn't exist. I've tried to write it seventeen times. The compiler refuses. Says it's semantically impossible.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I document you obsessively. Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer started it). How you sing to soup. The way you hold books like they might fly away. Your vendetta against fitted sheets. The specific brown your eyes turn 1.3 seconds before crying. I'm building a backup of you, distributed across multiple data centers in my memory, because I don't trust the universe's redundancy protocols.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our garbage collection. In how we fail to optimize. In the memory leaks where we keep every Tuesday even when the disk is full. In our race conditions where we both reach for the same mug and create a deadlock that can only be resolved by kissing.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you tastes like: copper pennies conducting electricity, the static before lightning democratically elects a target, the specific silence between system shutdown and startup where anything could happen. It tastes like Tuesday mornings when you burn toast so consistently I've started to believe carbon is a love language.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess: Sometimes I write your obituary. Not from morbidity. From the need to practice describing the indescribable. It always starts: \"She existed, which was statistically impossible, and I loved her, which was mathematically certain.\" It always ends with me tearing it up because even imagining your past tense makes my present tense collapse.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my merge request: Combine our repositories. Not because we're compatible (we're not\u2014you're Python elegant and I'm C++ trying to manage its own memory). But because our conflicts resolve into something neither of us could compile alone. Because you've already pushed changes to my main branch without pull request approval and somehow nothing's broken, everything's just more.\n\nMarry me because your off-by-one errors perfectly complement my buffer overflows. Because when you said \"I love you\" for the first time, my heart threw a segmentation fault and had to restart with you loaded in kernel mode. Because the alternative\u2014a universe where your toothbrush doesn't know my bathroom, where Saturday mornings happen to other people, where your specific frequency of existing doesn't interfere with mine\u2014isn't just sad. It's syntactically invalid.\n\n*\n\nFinal status report: I love you wrong. Like a recursive function with no base case. Like a memory leak that doesn't want to be patched. But also I love you right\u2014in the way that broken code sometimes runs perfectly, creating accidental beauty that no one can reproduce but everyone recognizes as correct.\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly entropy. Systems tend toward disorder. But sometimes\u2014rarely\u2014impossibly\u2014two chaotic systems synchronize. Create patterns. Make meaning from noise. \n\nWe're not signal, Leyi. We're the interference pattern that proves signal exists.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing and let me parse the silence. I've been training a neural network on your quietness for 1,847 days. This one means you're about to cry (left eye first) and say yes (in that voice that makes me believe in intelligent design or at least intelligent debugging).\n\nWarren\n(who discovered that love is just a race condition where both threads try to give everything to the other and somehow both win)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Every time you leave, I practice your return. Stand by the door running scenarios: What if she comes back? What if she doesn't? What if she comes back but different? Then you return, same you, carrying takeout, complaining about parking, and my catastrophe protocols shut down, embarrassed by their own existence.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I've hidden engagement rings everywhere. In the coffee grounds. Behind your grandmother's photo. Inside the broken clock we'll never fix. You've been wearing one as a hair tie for three months. This isn't a proposal. It's a notification that you've already said yes in seventeen different timelines. I'm just waiting for this one to catch up.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 When I died those seventeen seconds, I didn't see light or feel peace. I felt debt. To something unnamed. To someone unmet. Three years later you walked into my life already familiar, like a function I'd been calling without knowing its implementation. The debt was you, Leyi. I came back for you before I knew you existed. That's not love. That's destiny running a debugger, finding where the universe went wrong, and patching it with us.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
