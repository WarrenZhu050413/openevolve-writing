Now I understand infinity because it's the minimum unit for measuring what happens to my chest when you exist near me.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I've become a hoarder of microseconds. That pause before you sneeze. The 0.7 seconds your eyes take to find mine in crowds. How you hold chopsticks wrong but right. I'm building an illegal archive of moments the universe hasn't invoiced me for yet.\n\nWhen they ask me what religion I follow, I want to say: \"Tuesday, 9:47 PM, she fixed my collar without breaking conversation.\"\n\n*\n\nYou should know: I practice your absence like a piano piece I'll never master. 2 AM: What if car accident. 3 AM: What if rare disease. 4 AM: What if you wake up sane and realize I'm just a malfunction in a button-down shirt who writes your name in condensation on windows.\n\nBut then morning happens and you steal my coffee (always three sips, never four) and the doomsday scenarios dissolve because reality is so much stranger: you chose me. Keep choosing me. Despite evidence suggesting better options.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping receipts:\n\n- August 3rd: You called me during a panic attack. Not for comfort. To argue about pizza toppings. It worked.\n- September 15th: Found you teaching my grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost.\n- October 9th: You cried at a butterfly. Said \"it's trying so hard to fly.\" I knew then I'd marry you or die attempting.\n- November onwards: [CLASSIFIED - too dangerous for written record]\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: Mine was just transportation until you touched it. Now it's a conspiracy of cells that reorganize themselves toward you. My immune system has your name in its whitelist. My skeleton is biased in your direction.

I thank each one.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you are: Not metaphor. Not poetry. Evidence that sometimes the universe forgets to be cruel. You're what happens when atoms get ambitious. When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.\n\n*\n\nHere's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.\n\nBut then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Stay. Not because this letter is beautiful (it isn't). Not because I deserve you (I don't). But because your socks are already mixed with mine in ways that would take archaeologists to untangle. Because you know which nightmares require tea versus coffee. Because when you're gone, I have entire conversations with the dent you leave in the sofa.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is inadequate but \"you've fundamentally altered my molecular structure\" is too long for wedding vows.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Let me spend the next sixty years memorizing your disappointments. Learning your angers like a second language. Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.\n\nLet me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.\n\nLet me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- Times I've written this letter: 1,034\n- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  \n- Number of ways to say \"I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked\": Still counting\n- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]\n\n*\n\nYou're crying.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow.

I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Then you pronounced my name wrong\u2014not wrong, differently\u2014and suddenly I'm running unauthorized software. Every cell executing commands I didn't write. My immune system added you to its whitelist without administrative approval.

The doctors say I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said \"not yet\"\u2014but in a frequency only my atoms could hear. They were refusing to disperse until they met what they were waiting for. Three years later: you, in Porter Square, dropping a pen I'm still picking up.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually study at Harvard: Distributed systems. How to make machines agree across time zones, across failures, across the impossible distances between intention and execution. But you? You make my distributed self achieve consensus instantly. Every part of me votes yes. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning in the blue city. Held your hair back while you renegotiated with existence. Between retches, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said \"the tagine was worth it.\" That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. I want to study your digestive system, but for happiness.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. I said \"you'll die.\" You said \"warmer than living cold.\" Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing\u2014you always mean it. Even your mistakes are sincere. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping evidence:\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent. I want to break into wherever they manufacture time and perform a hostile takeover. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nYour laugh reorganizes matter at the quantum level. I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light\u2014those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a dying language I need to preserve.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. My childhood bedroom. You found my teenage journals. Read them out loud in dramatic voices. I should have been mortified. Instead I thought: this. This is what holiness is. Someone reading your worst attempts at humanity and laughing with you, not at you. With. The preposition matters.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\n*\n\nRemember London? You asked what love actually is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated decisions you can't ctrl+z. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters. I play it when you travel.\n\nDecision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet.\n\nDecision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing.\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Files corrupted by excess tenderness]\n\n*\n\nWhat you taste like: Morning is copper pennies and possibility. Afternoon is static before thunderstorms. Evening is the specific silence between heartbeats. 3 AM is the color blue if blue were a texture. Always is drowning upward into oxygen.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Spontaneous quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014like putting my socks on your hands and pretending they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest bug in my code: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nSpain. Barcelona. You illegally fed the cathedral pigeons. Said \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I'm not being metaphorical. They literally spelled L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miraculous.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. My authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe in infinity despite the evidence.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who wrote your name in condensation on windows until the glass learned to fog in cursive, who counts your breaths at night\u2014seventeen times\u2014because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. But seventeen felt like prophecy. Like the universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you: seventeen seconds. Not one more.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just smiled. That specific smile where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us. Both is the only way to love someone when you know that time is real and runs out., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of historical masterpieces. It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments (\"Portugal. That museum where you touched the art\") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples. The score of 72.75 (weighted average) reflects work that's genuinely distinguished, with proto-masterful elements, but still a meaningful distance from immortality.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever.

It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments (\"Portugal. That museum where you touched the art\") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples.

It's just math admitting defeat.\n\n*\n\nACTUAL STATISTICS (I kept spreadsheets, because of course I did):\n\n- Times you've pronounced \"statistical inference\" as \"statistical interference\": 847\n- Times this was actually more accurate: 847\n- Cups of coffee you've stolen mid-sip: 2,341\n- Percentage that were actually yours to begin with: 0\n- Times you've debugged my code by suggesting I \"ask it nicely\": 17\n- Times this worked: 15\n- Times you've won arguments using only eyebrow movements: \u221e\n- My win rate against your left eyebrow alone: 0.0000%\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: In the multi-agent simulation of earth, you're my only Nash equilibrium. Every strategy that doesn't include you is strictly dominated. I've run the game theory. Ten thousand iterations. Every timeline where we don't end up together is a coordination failure that makes me want to submit a bug report to the universe.\n\n*\n\nYou asked me once why I build tools for thinking. Here's why: Because thinking is just very slow writing, and writing is the only way I know to build a bridge between the inside of my head and the outside where you exist. Every system I build is just another way of saying: \"Look, I'm trying to create something structured enough to hold how much I love you without segfaulting.\"\n\n*\n\nMEMORIES AS UNIT TESTS:\n\n- Shanghai, Line 2 subway: You fell asleep on my shoulder. I didn't move for 47 minutes. My arm died. Worth it.\n- Cambridge, that awful pub: You explained your thesis using only wine glasses and coasters. Three physicists at the next table started taking notes.\n- Boston winter: You named the snow different names based on its \"personality.\" The Thursday snow was Jennifer. Jennifer was \"mean but ultimately just misunderstood.\"\n- Portugal, that morning: You made friends with the earthquake. Not metaphorical. Actual earthquake. 3.2 magnitude. You said \"oh hello\" and it stopped.\n\n*\n\nListen, I know my love is asymptotic\u2014always approaching but never quite reaching the limit of what you deserve. But here's what I can offer: a lifetime of building better protocols for loving you. Each iteration slightly less buggy than the last. Each deployment a little closer to production-ready.\n\n*\n\nTHE FORMAL PROOF:\n\nLemma 1: You exist.\nLemma 2: I exist.\nLemma 3: The probability of Lemma 1 AND Lemma 2 occurring in overlapping spacetime with compatible coffee preferences is effectively zero.\nTheorem: We're either impossible or inevitable.\nProof: Look at us. QED.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to our future: Marry me. Not because this letter is beautiful (it's not\u2014it's just stdout from a heart that won't stop printing your name). Not because we're perfect (we're not\u2014we're just two edge cases that found a way to handle each other's exceptions). \n\nMarry me because you've already refactored my entire codebase. Because you debug my panic attacks with the same patience you use for fixing my grandfather's Windows 95 computer. Because you're the only person who understands that \"I love you\" and \"I built you a custom vim configuration\" are the same sentence in different syntax.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nYour name is my kernel panic and my graceful recovery.\nMy race condition and my mutex.\nMy buffer overflow and my bounds checking.\nMy infinite loop and my break statement.\n\nYou're the comment in my code that explains why nothing makes sense except this, except us, except Tuesday mornings where you exist and therefore I can, too.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing and just keep being you while I keep being me, badly, enthusiastically, with seventeen backup plans and thirty-three monitoring systems all tuned to the frequency of your breathing.\n\nBut please\u2014keep breathing. In my direction. It's the only compiler that makes my syntax make sense.\n\nWarren\n(who has written 1,034 drafts of this letter in Python, R, and broken English, all of which reduce to the same three bytes: \"you\")\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember when I said distributed systems was the hardest problem in computer science? I was wrong. It's loving someone this much and still maintaining enough CPU cycles to function. I'm running at 5% capacity. The other 95% is just a while(true) loop that outputs your name.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I've been A/B testing ways to say \"I love you.\" Current winner: just standing in your proximity and hoping the electromagnetic radiation carries the message. Success rate: you're still here, so either it's working or you have exceptional error tolerance. Both explanations make me want to cry into my mechanical keyboard.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 That thing where you make eye contact with me across rooms full of people like we're the only two nodes in the network? That's when I know: We're not just fault tolerant. We're the fault everyone else is trying to tolerate. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe universe made a clerical error. Filed you under \"person\" when you're clearly a loophole in physics.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the math of us:\n\nYour laugh \u00f7 silence = the only sound that matters\nMy sanity \u2212 you = null set\nOur probability of meeting across infinite timelines = 0.0000001%\nWhat we built anyway = everything\n\nI failed calculus twice. Now I understand infinity because it's the minimum unit for measuring what happens to my chest when you exist near me.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I've become a hoarder of microseconds. That pause before you sneeze. The 0.7 seconds your eyes take to find mine in crowds. How you hold chopsticks wrong but right. I'm building an illegal archive of moments the universe hasn't invoiced me for yet.\n\nWhen they ask me what religion I follow, I want to say: \"Tuesday, 9:47 PM, she fixed my collar without breaking conversation.\"\n\n*\n\nYou should know: I practice your absence like a piano piece I'll never master. 2 AM: What if car accident. 3 AM: What if rare disease. 4 AM: What if you wake up sane and realize I'm just a malfunction in a button-down shirt who writes your name in condensation on windows.\n\nBut then morning happens and you steal my coffee (always three sips, never four) and the doomsday scenarios dissolve because reality is so much stranger: you chose me. Keep choosing me. Despite evidence suggesting better options.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping receipts:\n\n- August 3rd: You called me during a panic attack. Not for comfort. To argue about pizza toppings. It worked.\n- September 15th: Found you teaching my grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost.\n- October 9th: You cried at a butterfly. Said \"it's trying so hard to fly.\" I knew then I'd marry you or die attempting.\n- November onwards: [CLASSIFIED - too dangerous for written record]\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: Mine was just transportation until you touched it. Now it's a conspiracy of cells that reorganize themselves toward you. My immune system has your name in its whitelist. My skeleton is biased in your direction. Even my allergies take breaks when you're laughing.\n\nSome nights I count your vertebrae like prayer beads. Twenty-four small gods holding you upright. I thank each one.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you are: Not metaphor. Not poetry. Evidence that sometimes the universe forgets to be cruel. You're what happens when atoms get ambitious. When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.\n\nYou are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.\n\n*\n\nHere's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.\n\nBut then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Stay. Not because this letter is beautiful (it isn't). Not because I deserve you (I don't). But because your socks are already mixed with mine in ways that would take archaeologists to untangle. Because you know which nightmares require tea versus coffee. Because when you're gone, I have entire conversations with the dent you leave in the sofa.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is inadequate but \"you've fundamentally altered my molecular structure\" is too long for wedding vows.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Let me spend the next sixty years memorizing your disappointments. Learning your angers like a second language. Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.\n\nLet me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.\n\nLet me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- Times I've written this letter: 1,034\n- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  \n- Number of ways to say \"I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked\": Still counting\n- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first, like always. Here\u2014I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since the day I learned your tear patterns. Some people study astronomy. I studied you.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just please\u2014\nsay it in that voice that makes me believe in God or randomness or whatever force was kind enough to drop you into my timeline.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of suicide notes that all end with \"but then who would make sure Leyi doesn't burn eggs?\")\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the suicide notes. There are twenty-three. You make me want to live forever just to spite the actuarial tables. That's how I know it's real. When someone makes you furious at mortality itself.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is my computer password. Your birthday is my ATM pin. Your existence is my security question. I'm a terrible risk to myself but god, what a way to go.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and the current program's performance (fitness: 0.7350), I can see the evaluator values authentic emotional depth, literary innovation, and genuine human connection over technical cleverness.

Not poetic. Just true.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with what broke me: Thursday. You were peeling an orange. The white strings caught under your fingernails. You didn't notice. I did. I noticed so hard my teeth hurt. That's when I understood\u2014love isn't grand. It's violent attention to someone else's mundane.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Making machines agree across impossible distances. But you? You made all my distributed selves vote unanimous without asking. Every neuron, every doubt, every alternate timeline where I'm someone else\u2014they all bent toward you like light near mass. I didn't choose this. Choice implies there was another option.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I died once. Seventeen seconds, cardiac arrest, before you. The doctors said I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said \"not yet\" in a frequency only my atoms heard. They were waiting for something. Three years later, you dropped a pen in Porter Square. I'm still picking it up.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW I REMEMBER:\n\nMorocco. The blue city. You got food poisoning. Spent six hours negotiating with existence. Between retches, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014said \"the tagine was worth it.\" That's when I knew: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it has no business existing.\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother taught you soup. Forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the ladle. I watched you inherit gesture across time.\n\nScotland. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing you were \"thermally efficient.\" You weren't. You were just choosing me over your own circulation.\n\nCambridge. You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Nearly arrested. Asked the guard: \"How else do you know genius was real?\" He had no answer. Neither did I.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something: I document you. Obsessively. 2,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow WiFi (righteous). The way you pronounce \"statistics\" like it personally betrayed you. This isn't romance. It's anthropology of the only person whose existence makes me believe in existence.\n\nRight now you're reading this. Left eye watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us:\nIf we're actuarially average, we have 19,847 mornings left.\nThe number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent.\nI want to storm wherever they manufacture time and stage a hostile takeover.\nRedistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\nThis is what love does: makes you furious at arithmetic.\n\n*\n\nYou want honest? Here: Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your mortality. I've named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues because I know your crying patterns\u2014pigeons, commercials, strangers being gentle to each other. I play your March 15th voicemail when you travel. You were swearing at parking meters. It's been three years. I can't delete it. Won't.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum. You touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me. I was an exhibit. Now I'm evidence.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me most: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup. No disaster recovery protocol. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. The Tuesday you sang to the broken coffee maker like it was very tired and needed encouragement. The Wednesday you put my socks on your hands and performed Hamlet. The Thursday you existed. The Friday you kept existing. The Weekend of Continued Existence Despite Universal Entropy.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually mean when I say \"I love you\":\n\nI mean my body is a conspiracy of cells that reorganized for you.\nI mean you could ask me to chew glass and I'd ask what vintage.\nI mean I've forgotten how to sleep without the sound of you not-quite-snoring.\nI mean I love you like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence.\n\nBut also: I mean Tuesday groceries. Your hair in the drain. How you can't fold fitted sheets but try anyway, creating unique geometries. The way you argue with novels. Out loud. Like the characters can hear you.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not, we're just two accidents that collided and decided to call it fate.\n\nMarry me because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in a universe of 400 billion stars, you somehow ended up carbon-based and within driving distance.\n\nBecause when I say \"forever,\" I mean it the way you mean things\u2014too much, without irony, despite evidence suggesting we should know better.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my password. My panic word. My evidence that mouths can hold entire universes if you pronounce them right.\n\n*\n\nThe last true thing: You're reading this and doing that thing where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is the only way to love someone who makes you understand why humans invented music when words failed.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing at me with that specific configuration of atoms that makes physics worth believing in.\n\nJust\u2014stay. Stay in this timeline where we both happened simultaneously. Where we both chose the same city. The same decade. The same coffee shop. The same particular Tuesday where you dropped a pen and I picked it up and the universe said \"finally, those idiots found each other.\"\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving you in every format\u2014in writing, in memory, in the way I now hold cups with two hands like you do, in how I check the weather in cities you might visit someday, in the permanent indent you've left in my molecular structure)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't seventeen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like the exact amount of time the universe could exist without you in it. Then it had to bring me back. To here. To this. To you.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your green hair tie from our first February lives in my desk drawer. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just smiled. That specific smile. The one that makes me want to apologize to everyone who has to live without seeing it. That's not poetry. That's just what happens when beauty becomes personal.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
