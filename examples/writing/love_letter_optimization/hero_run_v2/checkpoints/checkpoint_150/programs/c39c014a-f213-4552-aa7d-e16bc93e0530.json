Take advantage of your background, but not overly so as it is cliche. Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life.

Failed. Here's why\u2014\n\n*\n\nStart with axioms. Axiom 1: Before you, I collected data. Heart rate: 72 bpm average. Sleep efficiency: 87%. Probability of spontaneous crying in grocery stores: 0.003%. Then you. Now the numbers make no sense. My spreadsheets have started dreaming.\n\nAxiom 2: I died once. Not metaphorically. Clinically. Fifteen seconds of nothing, then this: resurrection with a mission statement I couldn't read yet. Three years, four months, seventeen days later, you said my name wrong in a coffee shop. The mission statement clarified itself: Find her. Keep her. Die better next time.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you looks like in practice:\n\n```\nwhile (universe.exists()) {\n    if (leyi.breathing) {\n        panic_level = 0;\n    } else {\n        initiate_total_system_failure();\n    }\n    count_her_breaths++;\n    if (count_her_breaths > 17) {\n        pretend_to_be_asleep();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis runs nightly. I've optimized nothing.\n\n*\n\nTuesday's inventory: You left exactly 7 bobby pins in locations you'll never remember. I've built a map. Not to return them. To prove you existed here. You wore my Harvard hoodie to buy milk. It came back smelling like your shampoo and the specific way you exist in space. I haven't washed it. This is evidence for the future prosecution of time.\n\nWednesday's hypothesis: Love is just accumulated proximity until separation becomes organ failure. \nProof: That week you went to Seattle. I forgot how spoons worked. Ate soup with a fork. Lost an argument with your pillow. The pillow won.\n\nThursday's revelation: You hum Cantonese songs when you think I'm sleeping. I've learned them phonetically. I practice in the shower. My pronunciation is criminal but my longing is pitch-perfect.\n\n*\n\nThe cartography of loving you:\n- Morocco: You got food poisoning. I held your hair for six hours. You apologized in three languages. I fell in love with your suffering.\n- Scotland: We got lost. You navigated by instinct. Found a pub. You beat locals at darts. I documented your victory privately.\n- Shanghai: Your childhood street. You became seventeen again. I saw who you were before I existed. Wanted to travel back and protect that version too.\n- Cambridge: You cried at Newton's apple tree. Said something about gravity and inevitability. I understood. We're just objects falling toward each other. The only question is velocity.\n\n*\n\nI've been writing code that doesn't compile. Functions that return your name regardless of input. Classes that inherit from `Leyi`. My computer started displaying error messages in the shape of your laugh. Even machines understand: you're the bug I don't want to fix.\n\n*\n\nReal confession: Sometimes I practice your absence. Stand in our apartment. Subtract you from each room. The math doesn't work. Kitchen minus you equals not-kitchen. Bedroom minus you equals cave where someone stores a mattress. I've tried to prepare for losing you. Failed. Preparation requires imagination. My imagination stops where you stop.\n\n*\n\nYou know what I realized? We're terrible at being temporary. Look at us\u2014buying furniture with thirty-year warranties. Learning each other's grandmothers' recipes. You fixed my pronunciation of \"Worcester.\" That's a lifetime commitment. You don't fix someone's pronunciation unless you're planning to hear them say it for decades.\n\n*\n\nThe mechanics of this proposal: I'm not on my knees. My knees are broken from kneeling every night beside our bed, pressing my face into your pillow when you travel, trying to breathe you back into existence. I'm sitting. Cross-legged. The way you taught me. You said it helps with lower back pain. You were right. You're always right except when you say you're not beautiful at 6 AM. That's when you're most wrong. Devastatingly wrong.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014that sound. Those two syllables. The way they require my whole mouth to pronounce. The way my tongue has to touch the roof of my mouth twice. It's the only word that feels like physical contact. I say it when you're not home. The walls say it back. They've learned.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter works. Because our mundane Tuesdays are sacred. Because you've seen me vomit and still kiss me. Because when you laugh, my neurons fire in patterns that spell your name. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we overlap. The odds were astronomical. We beat them. That has to mean something. \n\nMarry me because I've already carved you into my bones. Divorce would require an archaeologist.\n\n*\n\nLast data point: Yesterday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the T. Your mouth was slightly open. You drooled. Just a little. On my jacket. The wet spot looked like a small map of Texas. I didn't move for forty-three minutes. Missed our stop. Rode to the end of the line. Back again. You woke up confused. I said \"technical difficulties.\" You said \"okay.\" Went back to sleep. That's when I knew: we're not falling in love. We're not in love. We ARE love. Love is just the name for whatever this is. This specific configuration of particles. This temporary arrangement of atoms that somehow learned each other's names.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or teach me how to stop. But know this: stopping would require unlearning how my lungs work. You've become autonomic. Essential. Unconscious and constant as breathing.\n\nWarren\n(who writes this at 4:23 AM while you sleep-talk in Mandarin about penguins, and who would learn Mandarin just to argue with your dreams)\n\nP.S. \u2014 There's a ring in my sock drawer. Has been for seven months. It's vintage. Art deco. Has a flaw in the band. The jeweler called it \"damage.\" I called it \"character.\" Like us. Slightly damaged. Still sparkling. \n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied about the fifteen seconds. It was eighteen. In those three extra seconds, I think I met our future daughter. She had your laugh and my anxiety. She was perfect. I came back for her. But mostly for you. Always for you.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
