The birds haven't lied yet. The sun hasn't made promises. Just me, calculating the physics of missing you while you sleep three feet away.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what actually happened:\n\nI was a functioning system. Clean code. Commented properly. Then you walked into Porter Square station and dropped that pen and my entire architecture segfaulted. Not crashed\u2014segfaulted. The kind of error where the program keeps running but nothing means what it used to mean.\n\nNow I process reality through corrupted memory. Everything returns *Leyi. Even the null pointers.\n\n*\n\nThe fifteen seconds I was dead:\n\nNot darkness. Not light. Just... probability. Every possible version of me spreading out like search results. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In every single iteration, there was this same moment. Someone drops something. Someone else picks it up. The universe pivots on that small kindness.\n\nI came back to find that kindness. Found you three years later, holding that exact pen, like the cosmos had been saving my place.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You apologized to the toilet between heaves. \"Sorry,\" you said to porcelain, \"you were made for better things.\"\n\nThat's when I understood: You assign dignity to everything you touch. Even the things designed to handle our shit. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, the soup:\n\nShe counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You counted in the space between us getting smaller. Forty-seven stirs. But stir thirty-three, when you started crying\u2014that wasn't about onions. That was about how love is just learning someone else's algorithm for staying alive, then running it forever even after they've stopped.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday:\n\nYou have a Tuesday face and a Wednesday face. Tuesday is 0.3% more symmetrical. Wednesday has that scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet at age seven. The cabinet won but you never admitted defeat.\n\nI love Wednesday more. Wednesday knows what losing looks like and shows up anyway.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, minus twelve Celsius, you technically dying:\n\nYou gave me your jacket. I said you'd freeze. You said, \"Rather freeze warm than live cold.\" Your syntax was breaking down from hypothermia but your logic was perfect. That's you\u2014even your malfunctions make sense.\n\nI kissed you to steal back your heat. Also because your wrongness is the only right I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: Distributed systems. How to make many things act like one thing.\nHere's what I actually study: How you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought has to pass through Leyi-shaped checkpoints.\n\nYou're not my bug. You're my feature. The one I didn't document because I was afraid management would remove it.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically:\n\nWe have 2,163 Tuesdays left, actuarially. I've built seventeen spreadsheets. Column A: Time remaining. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you existed (green hair tie, February, drawer number three). Column D: What happens after our last Tuesday.\n\nColumn D throws a division by zero error. The spreadsheet knows what I know: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. The museum. You touched the five-hundred-year-old marble:\n\nThe guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. The guard called security. You touched it a third time. We're banned for life.\n\nNow I touch everything. Especially things with \"Do Not Touch\" signs. Especially you when you're trying to be serious. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's eulogizing someone who's still burning toast. It's the violence of ordinary Wednesday when they exist so casually you want to scream at everyone: \"DON'T YOU SEE? THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE ENDING.\"\n\nLove is just the lag between meeting and losing, and what you do in that lag determines if you lived or just lasted.\n\n*\n\nI document everything wrong:\n\nHow you hold books: like they might evaporate.\nYour vendetta against alarm clocks: You've won 1,847 times.\nThe way you debug recipes: \"This cookbook is gaslighting me.\"\nThursday light on your temporal bone: Approximately divine.\n\nThis isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you happened.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764:\n\nYou stopped. Said: \"We're dying.\" Not \"going to die.\" Just \"dying.\" Present continuous. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this counts.\"\n\nYou kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like cowardice.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: Boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of self.\nAfter you: I'm a memory leak. I feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headaches arrive in my skull with a three-minute delay. When you can't sleep, my code won't compile.\n\nWe're quantumly entangled but physicists would say that's impossible at room temperature, and I'd say: then physics hasn't met Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like by time:\n- 6 AM: That specific density of silence before you wake, like the air is holding its breath\n- Noon: Ozone and the way you say \"hypothesis\" wrong to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our GPS coordinates\n- 3 AM: The precise flavor of fear that you'll vanish if I blink wrong\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning colors and my eyes are tasting sound\n\n*\n\nYour name rewrote my kernel. Every system call routes through \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and Tuesday memories. My bones remember your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like a recursive function with no base case\u2014infinitely, catastrophically, with a stack overflow that crashes the universe.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom:\n\nYou read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years. Should have been mortifying. Instead: sanctification. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with not at. The preposition changes everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nMarry me. Not because love. Because your socks have established residency in my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Gerald\" and now I can't change it without feeling like I'm betraying Gerald.\n\nMarry me because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, arguing about consciousness while burning the same toast the same way.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them evolved, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that isn't life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow dissolution. Quantum decoherence. By morning I'm arguing with entropy itself.\n\nThen you do that thing\u2014that half-stretch half-yawn that sounds like acceptance\u2014and my rehearsed grief deletes itself. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the universe.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this: Your left eye waters first. Always left. Your tears have manners. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I'm alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not a name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe infinity is a rounding error.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing this letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie like holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. Cathedral. Pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons spelled your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no.

Fifteen seconds. The doctors said \"cardiac event.\" I say: practice run. Because real death is watching you sleep and knowing that one day you won't.\n\n*\n\nThis morning you said my name wrong on purpose. \"War-ren\" like two separate words. Like you were taking it apart to see how it works. My whole body reorganized itself around that hyphen. This is what you do\u2014you break things correctly. You fix things wrong. Both are perfect.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you what happened in Morocco:\n\nYou got so sick I thought you were leaving. Not dying\u2014leaving. Like your soul was filing transfer papers. You threw up everything including, I swear, colors I haven't seen since. Between retches you said: \"This is still better than not being here with you.\" \n\nThat's when I knew I would follow you anywhere. Including toward death. Especially toward death. Because you make even that seem interesting.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: the way you distribute yourself across time so that even when you're gone, you're here. You left a hair tie in February. It's November. The hair tie is more real than my thesis.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY:\n\nLast week you asked what love is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I lied. I know exactly what it is:\n\nLove is the specific weight of your head on my shoulder during movies you'll claim you didn't sleep through. Love is me letting you lie about it. Love is the violence of small mercies\u2014how you pretend my cooking is edible, how I pretend your singing is on key, how we both pretend we're not terrified of how much this matters.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's soup recipe: forty-seven steps. You taught me thirty-nine. Said the last eight were \"family only.\" Your hands shook on \"family.\" Mine shook on \"only.\" We both knew what you were asking. We both knew my answer.\n\nThose last eight steps? I already know them. They're just different words for \"stay.\"\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me:\n\nNot death. Not pain. Not the heat death of the universe. But Tuesday. Specifically, the Tuesday when you realize I'm ordinary. That I'm just a collection of anxieties in a Harvard sweatshirt. That my love for you is not special or poetic but desperate. Desperate like lungs are desperate. Like gravity is desperate. Like atoms are desperate to hold together despite entropy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014\n\nBefore you, I had edges. Boundaries. I ended where my skin ended. Now I'm this sprawling disaster. I feel you brush your teeth in buildings I've never entered. When you can't sleep in Boston, my bed in Cambridge turns into a crime scene of insomnia. \n\nThis isn't poetry. This is a medical condition. I've been infected by you. The symptoms include: inability to imagine Wednesday without you, persistent belief that your laugh can cure cancer, chronic documentation of your existence like I'm preparing evidence for a trial where I have to prove love is real.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic:\n\nYour lips turned the color of mathematics. Still arguing about free will while your body shut down. I've never been more certain of anything: you would rather die proving a point than live without one. That's when I knew I would marry you. Not because you were right (you weren't). Because you were willing to die being wrong with such devastating conviction.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying:\n\nYour name has ruined my mouth for other words. Everything I say now is just elaborate padding around \"Leyi.\" My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious mind knows what my conscious mind pretends not to: you're the only word that matters. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your childhood bedroom. You showed me the wall where you measured yourself growing up. Pencil marks climbing toward heaven. You said: \"This is where I became who I am.\"\n\nI wanted to say: \"This is where the universe got it right.\"\nI wanted to say: \"This wall should be in a museum.\"\nI wanted to say: \"Thank you for becoming.\"\n\nInstead I just traced the marks with my finger like they were sheet music for a song about luck.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession:\n\nI love you incorrectly. Too much. Like a wound loves infection\u2014badly, but completely. Like drowning loves water\u2014fatally, but honestly. The operation to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans invented music for the moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nI document you obsessively. Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Gerald\" and have full arguments with it). The way you hold pens (wrong, but with authority). How you test if food is too hot (always with your ring finger, never your pinky, who decided this?).\n\nThis isn't romance. This is archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who will need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity before rain\n- Evening: the color purple if purple were a temperature\n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language you're inventing as you speak\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the alternate timelines:\n\nThe ones where we don't meet. Where you never drop that pen. Where I'm not there to pick it up. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines constantly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art. Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Some things demand to be touched even if it destroys them.\"\n\nYou were looking at me when you said it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because I deserve you. But because your socks are already in my drawer and I've started sorting them by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in every possible universe, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, close enough to touch, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL PROTOCOL:\n\nRight now, you're crying. Left eye first\u2014it's always left, like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a programming error\u2014recursively, infinitely, with no exit condition)\n(who has been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power always dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember Barcelona?

Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep.

It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks.

My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended.

These facts are related in ways that make physicists uncomfortable.\n\n*\n\nWhen they brought me back, the first thing I said was \"not yet.\" The doctors thought I meant death. I meant you. My atoms had made an appointment they needed to keep.\n\n*\n\nHere's what you need to understand about the data: I've become my own longitudinal study. Subject: one systems programmer who used to believe in deterministic outcomes. Variables: you, singing to broken appliances like they're just very tired.

You went hypothermic giving me your coat over mine. Your lips turned the color of literature. You said \"warmer to die warm than live cold\" and meant it.

You thrive in the radiation of everyday catastrophe.\n\n*\n\nI keep evidence:\n\nEntry #1: Your grandmother's soup recipe. Forty-seven steps.

It worked.\n\nEntry #1,847: [Current] You're reading this while I pretend to sleep. Your breathing changes when you read. I've mapped it. I could draw the topography of your attention.\n\n*\n\nYou asked what love is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated evidence of irreversibility. Watch:\n\nThe green hair tie from our first February: Lives in my desk drawer. I'm never giving it back.\n\nYour voicemail from March 15th: You swearing at parking meters. I play it during system crashes.\n\nThe scar on my palm: From catching the mug you threw at the news. Not at me. At the news. I got in the way. Would do it again.\n\nThese aren't memories. They're proofs. Of what? That two distributed systems can achieve consensus without protocols. That entropy can run backwards if you squint right. That the universe makes editing errors and sometimes they compile anyway.\n\n*\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught us soup through your translation. But you weren't translating recipes. You were translating love across three languages and fifty years and the impossible distance between her hands and ours. \n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. The guard said \"Miss, please\u2014\" You said \"He's dead. I'm alive. The math works out.\" We're banned for life. You consider this a fair trade.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps to the Summer Palace top. You kissed me at step nine hundred and one. \"See?\" you said. \"Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like betrayal.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I rehearse your death. Nightly. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Spontaneous existence failure. Then you do something stupid\u2014put my socks on your hands and perform Hamlet for the houseplants\u2014and my disaster simulations delete themselves out of respect for joy.\n\n*\n\nI've calculated our remaining Tuesdays. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent. I want to storm the central temporal processing unit and demand a recount. Negotiate with whatever cosmic middle management handles time distribution. Explain that we need more. That we're not done yet. That you haven't finished teaching the coffee maker all the words to that song.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup system, no disaster recovery. If you crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to Tuesday, 3:47 PM, when you asked if I thought plants got lonely.\n\n*\n\nBut here's what saves me: Your toothbrush knows my bathroom. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. I've seen you furious at automated phone trees, and you've seen me cry at commercials about dogs. We've achieved mutual assured destruction and chosen to disarm. Daily. Over coffee that you steal three sips of while I pretend not to count.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal submission to the universal court of continued existence:\n\nMerge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. It's broken and running anyway. Like us. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about whether that pigeon looks more like a Harold or a Kevin.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat word rewrote my source code. Everything routes through it now. Every function returns to it. I'm not asking you to love me. I'm informing you that you already do, have done, will do, in all tenses including the ones we haven't invented yet. \n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a bug report. The bug is that we're still pretending to be two separate programs when we're clearly running the same impossible code.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and keep doing that thing where you exist at frequencies that make the universe reconsider its fundamental constants.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who counts your breaths at night because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends, who would like to inform you that your left eye is watering first, always left, too consistent to be random, too random to be programmed, too specifically you to be anything but necessary)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied. It was seventeen seconds, not fifteen. Seventeen feels like prophecy. Like the universe showing me exactly how long I could survive without you. Not one second more.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That smile you're doing now. Where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us.

Like you were taking it apart to see how it works. My whole body reorganized itself around that hyphen. This is what you do\u2014you break things correctly. You fix things wrong. Both are perfect.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you what happened in Morocco:\n\nYou got so sick I thought you were leaving. Not dying\u2014leaving. Like your soul was filing transfer papers. You threw up everything including, I swear, colors I haven't seen since.

The hair tie is more real than my thesis.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY:\n\nLast week you asked what love is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I lied. I know exactly what it is:\n\nLove is the specific weight of your head on my shoulder during movies you'll claim you didn't sleep through. Love is me letting you lie about it. Love is the violence of small mercies\u2014how you pretend my cooking is edible, how I pretend your singing is on key, how we both pretend we're not terrified of how much this matters.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's soup recipe: forty-seven steps. You taught me thirty-nine. Said the last eight were \"family only.\" Your hands shook on \"family.\" Mine shook on \"only.\" We both knew what you were asking. We both knew my answer.\n\nThose last eight steps? I already know them. They're just different words for \"stay.\"\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me:\n\nNot death. Not pain. Not the heat death of the universe. But Tuesday. Specifically, the Tuesday when you realize I'm ordinary. That I'm just a collection of anxieties in a Harvard sweatshirt. That my love for you is not special or poetic but desperate. Desperate like lungs are desperate. Like gravity is desperate. Like atoms are desperate to hold together despite entropy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014\n\nBefore you, I had edges. Boundaries. I ended where my skin ended. Now I'm this sprawling disaster. I feel you brush your teeth in buildings I've never entered. When you can't sleep in Boston, my bed in Cambridge turns into a crime scene of insomnia. \n\nThis isn't poetry. This is a medical condition. I've been infected by you. The symptoms include: inability to imagine Wednesday without you, persistent belief that your laugh can cure cancer, chronic documentation of your existence like I'm preparing evidence for a trial where I have to prove love is real.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic:\n\nYour lips turned the color of mathematics. Still arguing about free will while your body shut down. I've never been more certain of anything: you would rather die proving a point than live without one. That's when I knew I would marry you. Not because you were right (you weren't). Because you were willing to die being wrong with such devastating conviction.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying:\n\nYour name has ruined my mouth for other words. Everything I say now is just elaborate padding around \"Leyi.\" My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious mind knows what my conscious mind pretends not to: you're the only word that matters. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your childhood bedroom. You showed me the wall where you measured yourself growing up. Pencil marks climbing toward heaven. You said: \"This is where I became who I am.\"\n\nI wanted to say: \"This is where the universe got it right.\"\nI wanted to say: \"This wall should be in a museum.\"\nI wanted to say: \"Thank you for becoming.\"\n\nInstead I just traced the marks with my finger like they were sheet music for a song about luck.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession:\n\nI love you incorrectly. Too much. Like a wound loves infection\u2014badly, but completely. Like drowning loves water\u2014fatally, but honestly. The operation to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans invented music for the moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nI document you obsessively. Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Gerald\" and have full arguments with it). The way you hold pens (wrong, but with authority). How you test if food is too hot (always with your ring finger, never your pinky, who decided this?).\n\nThis isn't romance. This is archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who will need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity before rain\n- Evening: the color purple if purple were a temperature\n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language you're inventing as you speak\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the alternate timelines:\n\nThe ones where we don't meet. Where you never drop that pen. Where I'm not there to pick it up. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines constantly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art. Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Some things demand to be touched even if it destroys them.\"\n\nYou were looking at me when you said it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because I deserve you. But because your socks are already in my drawer and I've started sorting them by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in every possible universe, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, close enough to touch, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL PROTOCOL:\n\nRight now, you're crying. Left eye first\u2014it's always left, like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a programming error\u2014recursively, infinitely, with no exit condition)\n(who has been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power always dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember Barcelona? You fed the cathedral pigeons illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February? It lives in my desk drawer with the other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 The fifteen seconds I was dead? I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all our moments simultaneously. Past, present, future, parallel, perpendicular. In every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there. Like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\nI came back because unfinished. The thing I needed to finish? This. Us. The impossible math of two people becoming one organism that breathes in syncopation.\n\nYou're my incomplete proof. My unsolved equation. My favorite error.\n\nLet me spend forever debugging this beautiful malfunction we've become.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7295 while exploring new territory in the feature space.

The birds haven't lied yet. The sun hasn't made promises. Just me, calculating the physics of missing you while you sleep three feet away.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what actually happened:\n\nI was a functioning system. Clean code. Commented properly. Then you walked into Porter Square station and dropped that pen and my entire architecture segfaulted. Not crashed\u2014segfaulted. The kind of error where the program keeps running but nothing means what it used to mean.\n\nNow I process reality through corrupted memory. Everything returns *Leyi. Even the null pointers.\n\n*\n\nThe fifteen seconds I was dead:\n\nNot darkness. Not light. Just... probability. Every possible version of me spreading out like search results. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In every single iteration, there was this same moment. Someone drops something. Someone else picks it up. The universe pivots on that small kindness.\n\nI came back to find that kindness. Found you three years later, holding that exact pen, like the cosmos had been saving my place.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You apologized to the toilet between heaves. \"Sorry,\" you said to porcelain, \"you were made for better things.\"\n\nThat's when I understood: You assign dignity to everything you touch. Even the things designed to handle our shit. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, the soup:\n\nShe counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You counted in the space between us getting smaller. Forty-seven stirs. But stir thirty-three, when you started crying\u2014that wasn't about onions. That was about how love is just learning someone else's algorithm for staying alive, then running it forever even after they've stopped.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday:\n\nYou have a Tuesday face and a Wednesday face. Tuesday is 0.3% more symmetrical. Wednesday has that scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet at age seven. The cabinet won but you never admitted defeat.\n\nI love Wednesday more. Wednesday knows what losing looks like and shows up anyway.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, minus twelve Celsius, you technically dying:\n\nYou gave me your jacket. I said you'd freeze. You said, \"Rather freeze warm than live cold.\" Your syntax was breaking down from hypothermia but your logic was perfect. That's you\u2014even your malfunctions make sense.\n\nI kissed you to steal back your heat. Also because your wrongness is the only right I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: Distributed systems. How to make many things act like one thing.\nHere's what I actually study: How you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought has to pass through Leyi-shaped checkpoints.\n\nYou're not my bug. You're my feature. The one I didn't document because I was afraid management would remove it.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically:\n\nWe have 2,163 Tuesdays left, actuarially. I've built seventeen spreadsheets. Column A: Time remaining. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you existed (green hair tie, February, drawer number three). Column D: What happens after our last Tuesday.\n\nColumn D throws a division by zero error. The spreadsheet knows what I know: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. The museum. You touched the five-hundred-year-old marble:\n\nThe guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. The guard called security. You touched it a third time. We're banned for life.\n\nNow I touch everything. Especially things with \"Do Not Touch\" signs. Especially you when you're trying to be serious. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's eulogizing someone who's still burning toast. It's the violence of ordinary Wednesday when they exist so casually you want to scream at everyone: \"DON'T YOU SEE? THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE ENDING.\"\n\nLove is just the lag between meeting and losing, and what you do in that lag determines if you lived or just lasted.\n\n*\n\nI document everything wrong:\n\nHow you hold books: like they might evaporate.\nYour vendetta against alarm clocks: You've won 1,847 times.\nThe way you debug recipes: \"This cookbook is gaslighting me.\"\nThursday light on your temporal bone: Approximately divine.\n\nThis isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you happened.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764:\n\nYou stopped. Said: \"We're dying.\" Not \"going to die.\" Just \"dying.\" Present continuous. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this counts.\"\n\nYou kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like cowardice.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: Boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of self.\nAfter you: I'm a memory leak. I feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headaches arrive in my skull with a three-minute delay. When you can't sleep, my code won't compile.\n\nWe're quantumly entangled but physicists would say that's impossible at room temperature, and I'd say: then physics hasn't met Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like by time:\n- 6 AM: That specific density of silence before you wake, like the air is holding its breath\n- Noon: Ozone and the way you say \"hypothesis\" wrong to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our GPS coordinates\n- 3 AM: The precise flavor of fear that you'll vanish if I blink wrong\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning colors and my eyes are tasting sound\n\n*\n\nYour name rewrote my kernel. Every system call routes through \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and Tuesday memories. My bones remember your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like a recursive function with no base case\u2014infinitely, catastrophically, with a stack overflow that crashes the universe.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom:\n\nYou read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years. Should have been mortifying. Instead: sanctification. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with not at. The preposition changes everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nMarry me. Not because love. Because your socks have established residency in my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Gerald\" and now I can't change it without feeling like I'm betraying Gerald.\n\nMarry me because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, arguing about consciousness while burning the same toast the same way.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them evolved, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that isn't life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow dissolution. Quantum decoherence. By morning I'm arguing with entropy itself.\n\nThen you do that thing\u2014that half-stretch half-yawn that sounds like acceptance\u2014and my rehearsed grief deletes itself. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the universe.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this: Your left eye waters first. Always left. Your tears have manners. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I'm alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not a name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe infinity is a rounding error.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing this letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie like holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. Cathedral. Pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons spelled your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February. Lives in my drawer between my passport and my will. Because they're all documents about places I'm going.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're about to smile but catch yourself. You always do at the end of my letters. Like joy is something you have to sneak up on. Don't catch yourself this time. Let it happen. I want to watch your face admit what your atoms already know: We're inevitable. We're impossible. We're here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
