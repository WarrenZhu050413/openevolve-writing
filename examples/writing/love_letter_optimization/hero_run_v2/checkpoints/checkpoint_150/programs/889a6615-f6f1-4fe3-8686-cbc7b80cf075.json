I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words.

You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone.

We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here.

Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :).

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

About how I've been studying distributed networks and fault tolerance, and suddenly realized: you are my consensus protocol. Every decision routes through you first\u2014not for permission, but for coherence. Without you, I'm just noise without signal.\n\n*\n\nHere's what they don't teach at Harvard:\n\nStatistical mechanics tells us entropy only increases. But you make my molecules organize themselves into impossible patterns. You're violating thermodynamics just by existing near me. The universe should file a complaint, but it's too busy taking notes.\n\n*\n\nI've been writing code to model us:\n\n```\nwhile (true) {\n    try {\n        imagine(life_without_you);\n    } catch (SegmentationFault) {\n        // This exception cannot be handled\n        // System terminates immediately\n        // No recovery possible\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler warns me about infinite loops. I ignore it. Some loops are meant to be infinite.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are to me:\n\nYou're not my other half\u2014that implies I was broken. You're my parallel process. We run simultaneously, sharing memory, corrupting each other's data in the most beautiful ways. When you laugh, my stack overflows. When you cry, my heap fragments. We're terrible for system stability, but perfect for each other.\n\n*\n\nI've been to Morocco with you, watching you haggle in the medina, your broken Arabic making vendors smile. Portugal, where you insisted on trying every pastel de nata in Lisbon, creating a ratings spreadsheet. The Scottish Highlands, where you got us lost because you were following a sheep instead of the trail. Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen\u2014watching you switch between languages like changing compiler flags.\n\nEach place: you became the coordinate system. Latitude and longitude stopped mattering. There was only \"distance from Leyi\" and \"direction toward Leyi.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has taught me about optimization:\n\nThe shortest path between two points isn't a straight line\u2014it's whatever path includes you. I'll take exponential time complexity if it means more iterations with you. Big-O notation breaks when measuring feelings. O(n\u00b2)? O(n!)? No. O(Leyi). Complexity: infinite. Runtime: forever. Space requirements: all of it.\n\n*\n\nA confession written in assembly language:\n\n```\nMOV heart, @Leyi\nCMP heart, empty\nJE impossible_state\nLOOP_FOREVER:\n    ADD love, infinity\n    JMP LOOP_FOREVER\n; No RET instruction\n; This function never returns\n```\n\n*\n\nYou know what's absurd? I study distributed systems, but you've turned me into a single point of failure. Every critical path goes through you. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery plan. Just total system dependence on a single node labeled \"Leyi.\"\n\nThis is terrible architecture.\nThis is perfect love.\n\n*\n\nRemember Cambridge? You explaining game theory while punting, nearly tipping us into the Cam because you were drawing Nash equilibria in the air. That's when I knew: you'd destabilized my equilibrium permanently. Every strategy now has only one solution: choose you.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about writing as technology for thinking: it fails here. Language was invented for smaller feelings. I need new primitives, new data structures. How do you store \"the way your voice changes when you talk about your grandmother\"? What's the time complexity of \"missing you even when you're next to me\"? Where do I allocate memory for \"future memories we haven't made yet\"?\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis:\n\nLove isn't distributed equally across spacetime. It pools in certain coordinates\u2014kitchens at 3 AM, departure gates, the specific bench in Boston Common where you told me about your childhood. These locations have higher love-density. We're walking through a universe with hidden topology, and only we can see the peaks and valleys.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Here:\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and run probability calculations. The chance that you chose me from all possible paths through the configuration space of reality. The math always returns NaN\u2014Not a Number. Some calculations exceed computational limits. Some things can't be quantified, only experienced.\n\n*\n\nA truth about parallel processing:\n\nWe're running different instruction sets but somehow maintaining synchronization. You process emotion in colors and textures. I process it in graphs and trees. Yet we arrive at the same conclusions: this is home. This is worth protecting. This is the only algorithm that matters.\n\n*\n\nLeyi, I need you to understand:\n\nYou've rewritten my kernel. Not the surface-level applications, but the core operating system. The basic functions that run below consciousness. Breathing now checks for your presence. Heartbeat runs a background process called \"is Leyi okay?\" Sleep initiates only after the \"Leyi is here\" check returns true.\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is diagnostic output from a system permanently altered.\n\n*\n\nFinal proof, written in the only language precise enough:\n\nLet love be defined as the limit of happiness as time approaches infinity.\nLet Leyi be defined as the source of all non-trivial happiness.\nTherefore, limit(t\u2192\u221e) happiness = Leyi.\n\nQED.\n\nExcept it's not \"quod erat demonstrandum.\"\nIt's \"quod erat Leyi.\"\nWhich was to be Leyi.\nWhich is all that needs proving.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMerge @Warren with @Leyi\nResolve all conflicts in favor of us\nCommit message: \"Found the bug.
