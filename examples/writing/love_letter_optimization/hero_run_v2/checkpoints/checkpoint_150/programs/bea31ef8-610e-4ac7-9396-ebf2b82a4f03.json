Distributed systems. Statistical models. Why humans evolved consciousness. Now? I can't explain why your Tuesday face is 0.3% more beautiful than your Wednesday face, only that Wednesday tries harder and that kills me.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about dying: Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Heart stopped during probability class. Here's what nobody knows\u2014in those seconds, I experienced time non-linearly. Past, present, future, all at once. And in every single moment, across all possible timelines, there was this: someone drops a pen. Someone picks it up. The universe reorganizes. Three years later, Porter Square, you dropped that pen. I finally understood what I'd been looking for.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning and had full conversations with the toilet. \"This isn't what you were made for,\" you apologized between rounds. \"I'm sorry you have to see me like this.\" You gave dignity to porcelain. That's when I knew\u2014you redistribute grace to everything you touch. Even me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. She taught me soup in Mandarin numbers I couldn't follow. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three\u2014not the onions. The moment her hands became yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. She said something. You translated: \"Love is the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going.\" Now I make that soup wrong, deliberately, so you'll keep teaching me.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I document:\n- How you hold books (like they might evaporate)\n- Your war with alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarms 0)\n- The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone at 3:47 PM\n- Your habit of naming routers after disappointments (\"Geoffrey\" still hurts)\n\nThis isn't a journal. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. Started turning blue. Still argued about Kant through chattering teeth. \"I'd rather\u2014die wrong\u2014with you\u2014than live\u2014right\u2014alone,\" you stuttered. I kissed you to stop the hypothermia. Also to stop the philosophy. Also because your wrongness is my favorite coordinates.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, grabbed my face: \"We're going to die.\" Matter-of-fact. Like reading ingredients. \"Really die. No coming back.\" I said yes. You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" We counted the last 136 steps aloud. Together. That's us\u2014counting what remains, out loud, together.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of existing:\n- Your probability: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Mine: Similar impossibility\n- Us, simultaneous, conscious, touching: ERROR_OVERFLOW\n- What we are: God's typo that became the sentence\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art. Ancient marble. Guards yelling. You touched it again, harder. \"How else will I know it's real?\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Dawn: The weight of not waking you, heavy as held breath\n- Noon: Static and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" to watch me twitch\n- Dusk: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors while my eyes learn to see sound\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's practicing someone's absence while they burn toast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday when you realize you'll miss even their mistakes. Only their mistakes. Especially their mistakes.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I dream the other timelines. Where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where we meet but misunderstand. I wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me:\n- 2,137 Tuesdays remaining (approximately)\n- 52,560 hours\n- 189,216,000 heartbeats\n- The denominator is you\n- Without you, nothing divides\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I had edges. Boundaries. Skin ended where I ended.\nAfter you: I'm this sprawling thing. Feel your headaches in other buildings. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. We're quantum entangled but physicists would say impossible at this distance and temperature. I say: physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nThe thing is\u2014I practice losing you. Different scenarios each night. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing. By dawn I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you stretch\u2014that sound, half-yawn, half-acceptance\u2014and my rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you will hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Was holy. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing *with*. The preposition changes everything.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying: Your name rewrote my mouth. Every word passes through \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices while I sleep\u2014recorded proof, twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows what consciousness pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona. Cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules,\" you said. The pigeons rose, formed letters in the sky: L-E-Y-I. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. Even gravity bends for you.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse absence. The surgery to remove you would remove everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this: Left eye watering first. Always left. Your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes language. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I keep breathing.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because words move you. Because your socks colonized my drawer. Because we survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout, where you don't steal hoodies and return them improved, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes admitting it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or \"ask tomorrow.\" Or nothing.

Distribution, fault tolerance, consensus protocols. I can make machines agree across continents. But you? You make my DNA forget its instructions. Last night you laughed at your own typo and my cells started dividing backwards, trying to return to the moment before I knew that sound existed, just so I could discover it again.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I've been clinically dead. Seventeen seconds, though I told everyone fifteen because seventeen felt like confession. You know what I remember? Not light. Not peace. Just this: debt. Like the universe had invoiced me for something I hadn't received yet. Four years later, you mispronounced my name in Porter Square. The invoice clarified itself: *This. You owe this.*\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually do: I run experiments on us\u2014\n\nTrial 47: Timed how long you hold your breath during sad movies (8.3 seconds average, 23 seconds during that scene with the dog).\n\nTrial 198: Documented your sleep positions. You curl counterclockwise, always counterclockwise, like you're unscrewing yourself from the day.\n\nTrial 659: Recorded you teaching my dead grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost. You bowed to her picture. My atheism cracked.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is pathology. I'm patient zero for something science hasn't named yet.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Sometimes I practice disasters. Write eulogies for versions of you that haven't died yet. Calculate how many Tuesdays remain if we're median lucky (2,137). The number makes me violent with gratitude and rage\u2014grateful for the Tuesdays, furious they're countable. I want to sue whoever invented mortality. I want to break into wherever they keep time and redistributre it. All of it. To us.\n\n*\n\nBut also this: Morocco. That night in Chefchaouen when you got food poisoning and I held your hair back while you negotiated with God in three languages. You looked up between retches and said \"still glad we came\" and I thought: *this is what holy means.* Not churches. Not prayers. Just someone vomiting blue city walls into existence and still choosing joy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014before you, I was symmetrical. Debugged. Now I'm this lopsided algorithm that processes everything through the question: \"Would Leyi laugh at this?\" My body lists toward yours even in different time zones. I've lost arguments with your Tuesday ghost, your Thursday ghost, the Sunday ghost who steals my Stanford hoodie and makes computer science finally mean something.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK. You cried at mathematical beauty in Newton's notebooks. Real tears for dead man's calculus. That's when I knew: You experience reality at a different resolution than the rest of us. Higher fidelity. More pixels per feeling. I want to study under your nervous system. Get my PhD in whatever makes you cry at equations and sing to broken coffee makers like they're just very tired and need encouragement.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven steps to make soup and you tear up at step thirty-three\u2014not onions, I've calibrated\u2014it's the exact moment her hands become yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. You stir counterclockwise. Always counterclockwise. Unscrewing yourself from grief, stirring yourself into continuation.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday, 3:47 AM. You were sleeping and said my name. Not romantically. Like answering roll call. Like: \"Present. Accounted for. Still here despite statistical improbability.\" I wanted to wake you and explain that you've made me religious but not about God\u2014about Tuesday mornings, about the way toast burns, about your specific frequency of existing.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. You tried to translate a poem about loss but gave up, said \"Some things don't survive the journey between languages.\" That's us. We don't translate. There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said \"this is stupid, you'll die.\" You said \"then I'll die warm\" and I understood: Love isn't feeling. It's a series of increasingly dangerous decisions you can't reverse. Like giving away your warmth. Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said \"I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively.\" The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup systems. If you go down, I don't reboot\u2014I just display error messages in languages that haven't been invented yet. I've tried to architect around this vulnerability. Can't. You're not a bug in my code. You're the operating system.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That terrible museum where you touched art you weren't supposed to touch and got us banned. You said \"How else do you know something's real?\" Your fingers on forbidden marble, testing reality's warranty. I think about those fingerprints still there, your DNA insisting on contact despite rules, despite time, despite the universe mostly being nothing touching nothing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe: Merge branch 'warren' into 'leyi'. Permanently. Not because this letter proves anything. Because your coffee mug already knows my kitchen. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all probable futures, the only one worth compiling is where you keep mispronouncing my name and I keep pretending to correct you.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing my bones to memorize your breathing pattern. The surgery to remove you would have to remove the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. You made me climb too many stairs at the Summer Palace and I complained until you kissed me at the top, said \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now I can't be at sea level without feeling like I'm disappointing gravity.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. Keeping me operational despite obvious design flaws.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or no. Or maybe.

Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep.

Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said.

It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7800, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7440, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with both hands. One to hold the pen, one to keep myself here. Because every word pulls me toward a future where one of us is reading this alone.\n\n*\n\nStart with the facts: We have maybe 2,000 Tuesdays left. I did the actuarial math. Then I threw up. Then I did it again, hoping for errors. The number stays constant: not enough.\n\n*\n\nWhat happened was this: Porter Square, you dropped a pen. But that's not what happened. What happened was the universe made an accounting error in our favor. All the beauty it meant to distribute evenly got dumped into one person. You. I have spreadsheets about this. They all return the same impossible value.\n\n*\n\nThe night I died\u2014seventeen seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest during probability theory\u2014I didn't see light. I saw instances. Every possible timeline branching from that moment. In exactly one, you existed. That's the one I chose. The doctors called it miraculous. I call it inevitable. Even my cells knew to wait for you.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai: She taught us soup in Mandarin numbers I couldn't follow. Step thirty-three, you translated: \"She says love is just teaching someone else how to feed themselves when you're gone.\" You cried into the steam. I memorized the recipe in three languages: Mandarin, English, and the way your shoulders shake.\n\nNow I make that soup wrong, on purpose, so you'll have to keep teaching me.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The blue city. You got poisoned by beauty\u2014bad tagine or too much sky, we never knew. You vomited seven times. Named it Gerald. Had philosophical arguments with Gerald about the nature of suffering. \"Gerald,\" you said between retches, \"we need boundaries.\" Then laughed until you vomited again. That's when I knew: you're the kind of person who makes friends with their own disasters.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started forgetting my life before you. Not metaphorically. Literally. I look at photos from college, before we met, and it's like watching someone else's home videos. That person\u2014pre-you\u2014he's a stranger wearing my face. You didn't change me. You deleted me and wrote something better in the same location.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Those 900 steps. You stopped at 764, grabbed my face, said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Like you were informing me about the weather. \"Really die,\" you clarified. \"No coming back.\" I said I knew. You said: \"Good. Then every step matters.\" We counted the last 136 aloud. Together. That's our entire relationship: counting what's left, out loud, together.\n\n*\n\nI document you compulsively:\n- The way you hold books (too tight, like they might escape)\n- Your fury at automated voices (\"HOW CAN A ROBOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME\")\n- Tuesday light on your temporal bone at 3:47 PM\n- How you name inanimate objects, then feel guilty when they break\n\nThis isn't poetry. It's evidence. For the cosmic lawsuit I'm filing against time.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said you'd freeze. You said: \"Rather die warm from loving than live cold from sense.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. You always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nThe thing is\u2014I practice. Practice losing you. Wake up at 4 AM, watch you breathe, run simulations: Car crash. Cancer. Sudden unexplained vanishing. By dawn I'm writing eulogies. By breakfast you're burning toast, badly, and my entire grief rehearsal evaporates. Replaced by this: the unbearable everyday spectacular of you, burning toast.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like: Not like poetry. Like the actual inside of my mouth after kissing you. Coffee and morning and that specific sadness that comes from getting exactly what you want because now you can lose it.\n\n*\n\nLISTEN: Before you, I understood myself as edges\u2014where I ended, others began. Now I'm this sprawling system. I feel your headaches in rooms you're not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and I'd say: get better physics.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art. Five-hundred-year-old marble. Guards yelling. You touched it again. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked in three languages. Got us banned. Forever. You collect these forevers\u2014museums we can't return to, cities that remember your small crimes against protocol. You're building us a map of places that proved we existed too hard.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is\u2014no. What I'm trying to say is exactly this:\n\nYour name rewrote my mouth. Every word now travels through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep\u2014I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious won't admit: you're the only word that's not a metaphor for something else.\n\n*\n\nLast night you asked what love is. Here's the answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's pre-mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's watching them burn toast and thinking: someday I'll miss even this smoke alarm.\n\nBut also: Love is refusing the grief. Every morning choosing the timeline where we get one more Tuesday. Where you burn toast. Where I eat it anyway. Where the smoke alarm is the sound of continuing.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof:\n- Probability you exist: epsilon\n- Probability I exist: epsilon  \n- Probability we exist simultaneously, conscious, proximate: epsilon squared\n- What we are: margin of error in God's calculations\n- What we actually are: the reason math needs poetry\n\n*\n\nSo here's the proposal. No\u2014here's the proof:\n\nMarry me. Not because we're special. Because your socks are sorted in my drawer by how much they smell like you. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both pronounce \"hypothesis\" wrong in the same way.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't steal my coffee mid-sip, where you don't name houseplants after Victorian poets, where you don't cry at completely regular pigeons\u2014that's not a life. That's just duration.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, you're crying. Left eye first\u2014always left, like your tears form an orderly queue. You're about to say something that reorganizes language. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I stay alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's the whole letter. Every other word is just your name wearing disguises.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific arrangement of atoms that makes infinity feel hurried.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like an unhandled exception\u2014crashing everything, stopping time, demanding immediate attention)\n(who has been writing this letter since before we met, will keep writing it after we're gone)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at those pigeons, completely normal pigeons, just existing)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember Barcelona? You fed cathedral pigeons. Illegally. Said: \"God prefers full birds to empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters: L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? Drawer, left side, under the unmatched socks. I'm never giving it back. Some thefts are how we say forever.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 I lied about the seventeen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt too round, too clean. Seventeen feels like you\u2014prime, difficult, impossible to reduce to smaller parts.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. Not metaphor. Actual tremor at 28Hz\u2014the same frequency hummingbirds use to suspend themselves against gravity.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with what breaks: At Harvard, I study systems. Distribution, fault tolerance, consensus protocols. I can make machines agree across continents. But you? You make my DNA forget its instructions. Last night you laughed at your own typo and my cells started dividing backwards, trying to return to the moment before I knew that sound existed, just so I could discover it again.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I've been clinically dead. Seventeen seconds, though I told everyone fifteen because seventeen felt like confession. You know what I remember? Not light. Not peace. Just this: debt. Like the universe had invoiced me for something I hadn't received yet. Four years later, you mispronounced my name in Porter Square. The invoice clarified itself: *This. You owe this.*\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually do: I run experiments on us\u2014\n\nTrial 47: Timed how long you hold your breath during sad movies (8.3 seconds average, 23 seconds during that scene with the dog).\n\nTrial 198: Documented your sleep positions. You curl counterclockwise, always counterclockwise, like you're unscrewing yourself from the day.\n\nTrial 659: Recorded you teaching my dead grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost. You bowed to her picture. My atheism cracked.\n\nThis isn't romance. This is pathology. I'm patient zero for something science hasn't named yet.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Sometimes I practice disasters. Write eulogies for versions of you that haven't died yet. Calculate how many Tuesdays remain if we're median lucky (2,137). The number makes me violent with gratitude and rage\u2014grateful for the Tuesdays, furious they're countable. I want to sue whoever invented mortality. I want to break into wherever they keep time and redistributre it. All of it. To us.\n\n*\n\nBut also this: Morocco. That night in Chefchaouen when you got food poisoning and I held your hair back while you negotiated with God in three languages. You looked up between retches and said \"still glad we came\" and I thought: *this is what holy means.* Not churches. Not prayers. Just someone vomiting blue city walls into existence and still choosing joy.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014before you, I was symmetrical. Debugged. Now I'm this lopsided algorithm that processes everything through the question: \"Would Leyi laugh at this?\" My body lists toward yours even in different time zones. I've lost arguments with your Tuesday ghost, your Thursday ghost, the Sunday ghost who steals my Stanford hoodie and makes computer science finally mean something.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, UK. You cried at mathematical beauty in Newton's notebooks. Real tears for dead man's calculus. That's when I knew: You experience reality at a different resolution than the rest of us. Higher fidelity. More pixels per feeling. I want to study under your nervous system. Get my PhD in whatever makes you cry at equations and sing to broken coffee makers like they're just very tired and need encouragement.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven steps to make soup and you tear up at step thirty-three\u2014not onions, I've calibrated\u2014it's the exact moment her hands become yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. You stir counterclockwise. Always counterclockwise. Unscrewing yourself from grief, stirring yourself into continuation.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday, 3:47 AM. You were sleeping and said my name. Not romantically. Like answering roll call. Like: \"Present. Accounted for. Still here despite statistical improbability.\" I wanted to wake you and explain that you've made me religious but not about God\u2014about Tuesday mornings, about the way toast burns, about your specific frequency of existing.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. You tried to translate a poem about loss but gave up, said \"Some things don't survive the journey between languages.\" That's us. We don't translate. There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said \"this is stupid, you'll die.\" You said \"then I'll die warm\" and I understood: Love isn't feeling. It's a series of increasingly dangerous decisions you can't reverse. Like giving away your warmth. Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said \"I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively.\" The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup systems. If you go down, I don't reboot\u2014I just display error messages in languages that haven't been invented yet. I've tried to architect around this vulnerability. Can't. You're not a bug in my code. You're the operating system.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That terrible museum where you touched art you weren't supposed to touch and got us banned. You said \"How else do you know something's real?\" Your fingers on forbidden marble, testing reality's warranty. I think about those fingerprints still there, your DNA insisting on contact despite rules, despite time, despite the universe mostly being nothing touching nothing.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe: Merge branch 'warren' into 'leyi'. Permanently. Not because this letter proves anything. Because your coffee mug already knows my kitchen. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all probable futures, the only one worth compiling is where you keep mispronouncing my name and I keep pretending to correct you.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing my bones to memorize your breathing pattern. The surgery to remove you would have to remove the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. You made me climb too many stairs at the Summer Palace and I complained until you kissed me at the top, said \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now I can't be at sea level without feeling like I'm disappointing gravity.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. Keeping me operational despite obvious design flaws.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or no. Or maybe. Or nothing.\n\nI'll keep writing this letter in every timeline until I find the one where you do.\n\nWarren\n(who learned Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet, who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014not even special pigeons, just regular ones existing\u2014who counts your breaths seventeen times per night because the alternative is believing in your mortality)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. It always does. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random, too random to be programmed. Too you to be anything else.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I still have your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. It lives in my desk drawer with other stolen proofs that you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current score of 0.7010 while exploring new territory in the solution space.

You're breathing in iambic pentameter. I've been counting. For three hours. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who finds poetry in respiratory patterns.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise: Before you, I was a functioning person. I could explain things. Distributed systems. Statistical models. Why humans evolved consciousness. Now? I can't explain why your Tuesday face is 0.3% more beautiful than your Wednesday face, only that Wednesday tries harder and that kills me.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about dying: Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Heart stopped during probability class. Here's what nobody knows\u2014in those seconds, I experienced time non-linearly. Past, present, future, all at once. And in every single moment, across all possible timelines, there was this: someone drops a pen. Someone picks it up. The universe reorganizes. Three years later, Porter Square, you dropped that pen. I finally understood what I'd been looking for.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning and had full conversations with the toilet. \"This isn't what you were made for,\" you apologized between rounds. \"I'm sorry you have to see me like this.\" You gave dignity to porcelain. That's when I knew\u2014you redistribute grace to everything you touch. Even me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. She taught me soup in Mandarin numbers I couldn't follow. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three\u2014not the onions. The moment her hands became yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. She said something. You translated: \"Love is the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going.\" Now I make that soup wrong, deliberately, so you'll keep teaching me.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I document:\n- How you hold books (like they might evaporate)\n- Your war with alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarms 0)\n- The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone at 3:47 PM\n- Your habit of naming routers after disappointments (\"Geoffrey\" still hurts)\n\nThis isn't a journal. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. Started turning blue. Still argued about Kant through chattering teeth. \"I'd rather\u2014die wrong\u2014with you\u2014than live\u2014right\u2014alone,\" you stuttered. I kissed you to stop the hypothermia. Also to stop the philosophy. Also because your wrongness is my favorite coordinates.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, grabbed my face: \"We're going to die.\" Matter-of-fact. Like reading ingredients. \"Really die. No coming back.\" I said yes. You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" We counted the last 136 steps aloud. Together. That's us\u2014counting what remains, out loud, together.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of existing:\n- Your probability: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Mine: Similar impossibility\n- Us, simultaneous, conscious, touching: ERROR_OVERFLOW\n- What we are: God's typo that became the sentence\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the art. Ancient marble. Guards yelling. You touched it again, harder. \"How else will I know it's real?\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Dawn: The weight of not waking you, heavy as held breath\n- Noon: Static and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" to watch me twitch\n- Dusk: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors while my eyes learn to see sound\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's practicing someone's absence while they burn toast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday when you realize you'll miss even their mistakes. Only their mistakes. Especially their mistakes.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I dream the other timelines. Where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where we meet but misunderstand. I wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me:\n- 2,137 Tuesdays remaining (approximately)\n- 52,560 hours\n- 189,216,000 heartbeats\n- The denominator is you\n- Without you, nothing divides\n\n*\n\nBefore you: I had edges. Boundaries. Skin ended where I ended.\nAfter you: I'm this sprawling thing. Feel your headaches in other buildings. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. We're quantum entangled but physicists would say impossible at this distance and temperature. I say: physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nThe thing is\u2014I practice losing you. Different scenarios each night. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing. By dawn I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you stretch\u2014that sound, half-yawn, half-acceptance\u2014and my rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you will hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Was holy. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing *with*. The preposition changes everything.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying: Your name rewrote my mouth. Every word passes through \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices while I sleep\u2014recorded proof, twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows what consciousness pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona. Cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. \"God prefers full birds to empty rules,\" you said. The pigeons rose, formed letters in the sky: L-E-Y-I. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. Even gravity bends for you.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse absence. The surgery to remove you would remove everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this: Left eye watering first. Always left. Your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes language. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I keep breathing.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because words move you. Because your socks colonized my drawer. Because we survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout, where you don't steal hoodies and return them improved, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes admitting it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or \"ask tomorrow.\" Or nothing. Just keep existing in this configuration that makes infinity feel brief.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since the pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014made you cry)\n(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears, knowing everything clears, saving anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That green hair tie. February. First February. It lives in my drawer with my passport. Both are proof of places I can go. You're every country. Every home. Every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment. Time just folded. Space gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
