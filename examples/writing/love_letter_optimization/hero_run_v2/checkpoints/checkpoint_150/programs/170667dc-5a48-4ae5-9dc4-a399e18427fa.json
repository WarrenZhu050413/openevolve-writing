You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete.

Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration.

Death tastes like deleted emails\u2014sudden, irreversible, grammatically incomplete. They restarted my heart but something stayed broken. A debt to nowhere. Four years later you walked into Tuesday wearing Wednesday's rain and the debt had a name: every moment I hadn't met you yet.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT B: EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION\n\nI'm building an algorithm of you:\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM.

You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied.

Not physically. But that awareness that time is a thief. Until you. Now I'm furious at mortality. Now I want to live to 200 just to have more Wednesdays where you leave bobby pins in my car like breadcrumbs back to you.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something: Shanghai, that terrible hotel, you got food poisoning and spent three days creating what you called \"an intimate relationship with the bathroom tiles.\" You apologized seventeen times for being gross. But Leyi\u2014watching you that vulnerable, holding your hair back at 3 AM while you cursed in three languages\u2014that's when I understood what people mean by \"sacred.\" Not churches. Not ceremonies. Just the willingness to see someone at their smallest and still think: \"Yes. This one. Forever this one.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we got lost, remember? No signal, no map, just us and sheep that judged our life choices. You said: \"If we die here, I want the sheep to know it was your fault.\" But then you held my hand and we walked toward what might have been nowhere, and I thought: \"This is it. This is the whole point. To be lost with someone who makes nowhere feel like a destination.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a broken mathematician. I keep trying to solve for X where X equals \"enough\" and the equation never balances because there is no enough. There's only this spreading condition where you've colonized my nervous system and now my cells divide in your direction.\n\nPortugal, you saved a beetle from drowning in the hotel pool. Gave it CPR with a cocktail straw. It died anyway. You cried. I fell in love with you retroactively, all the way back to before I was born.\n\n*\n\nBoston winter, you made me drive to four different stores looking for the specific brand of soy sauce your grandmother used. We found it. You opened it in the parking lot, smelled it, and cried because memory has a scent and yours smells like a woman I'll never meet but whose recipes I've memorized because they're maps to your childhood.\n\n*\n\nI want to tell you about the mathematics of survival:\n\nNumber of times I've practiced your eulogy: 73\nNumber of times I've had to stop because I couldn't breathe: 73\nNumber of parallel universes where we don't meet: infinite minus one\nThe one where we do: this one, impossibly, this one\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your hometown, you showed me the tree you climbed as a child. You'd carved something in Chinese. You wouldn't translate it. Later your mother told me it said \"I will be brave.\" You were seven. You were already brave. You just didn't know it yet.\n\n*\n\nLondon, midnight, we fought about something so stupid I can't remember what. You slept on the hotel bathroom floor out of spite. I slept outside the bathroom door because even your anger has gravity and I'm a willing satellite. At 3 AM you opened the door and said \"This is ridiculous\" and I said \"I know\" and we made love on that terrible bathroom floor and you laughed so hard you got hiccups and I thought: \"This is prayer. This is what prayer was trying to be.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi, here's the ugliest truth: Loving you has made me greedy. I want sixty more years minimum. I want to watch your hair turn grey (it'll start at your left temple, I can already see the future in certain light). I want to argue about thermostats and whether tomatoes belong in the fridge. I want mundane Tuesdays where nothing happens except we both exist in the same room doing different things, occasionally looking up to make sure the other is still there.\n\n*\n\nFrance, you tried to order coffee in French but accidentally ordered a bicycle. The waiter was confused. You were confused. I was useless, laughing too hard to help. You ended up drawing a picture of coffee on a napkin. It looked like a crime scene. You got your coffee anyway. This is you: you fail at language but succeed at human.\n\n*\n\nItaly, Venice, you said the city was sinking and so were we, just slower. You were drunk on terrible wine and wisdom. You fell in a canal trying to pet a pigeon. I jumped in after you. We were banned from that restaurant. Worth it. Everything with you is worth it.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your parents' apartment, you warned me they wouldn't like me. Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Your father taught me chess. They didn't like me. They loved me. But not for me\u2014for how you looked at me when you thought no one was watching. Your mother said, in broken English: \"She is different with you. More... more she.\"\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I was functional. Had all my organs in the right places. Now I'm this rattling collection of memories that only make sense when you're there to verify them. Yes, that happened. Yes, we were there. Yes, that was us, being impossible together.\n\n*\n\nLast week you said \"I love you\" in your sleep. But you said it wrong\u2014\"I love you Warren\" like Warren was the verb. Like you were speaking a language where to Warren meant to build a life so specific no one else could fit inside it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, Leyi:\n\nLet's Warren together until one of us stops working. Let's make verbs of our names. Let's be a two-person cult that worships Sunday crosswords and Wednesday night takeout and the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" (spacifically, always spacifically).\n\nLet me be the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were twelve. Who knows you count stairs when you're nervous. Who knows you love me like it's a chronic condition you've decided not to cure.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We've already been married in seventeen different cities. Every shared meal was a wedding. Every fight that ended in laughter was a vow. Every time you fell asleep on my shoulder on a train/plane/automobile, we were declaring ourselves to the universe.\n\nBut I want the paper. The proof. The legal document that says what we already know: that we're a medical anomaly, two people who share a circulatory system and can't be separated without causing massive organ failure.\n\n*\n\nMarry me, Leyi.\n\nNot because it'll change anything.\n\nBecause it won't.\n\nBecause we're already us.\n\nBecause the rest is just paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken compass that only points to you)\n(who would find you in every universe, even the ones where we're just atoms)\n(who is, irreversibly, permanently, molecularly yours)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about one thing.
