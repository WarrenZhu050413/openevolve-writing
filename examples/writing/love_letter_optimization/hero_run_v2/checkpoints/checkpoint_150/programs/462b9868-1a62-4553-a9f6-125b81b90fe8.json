Your breathing changes everything about gravity.\n\n*\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's mostly terror. Beautiful terror. Like discovering you've been walking on a tightrope your whole life and only now noticing the drop.\n\nTuesday, 2:17 PM\u2014you said my name like punctuation that changes the whole sentence. The world reorganized. Not metaphorically. Literally. Birds flew backwards. My blood remembered how to move.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems. You are my total system failure. My beautiful catastrophe. Every error message leads back to you.\n\n*\n\nListen: I died once. Fifteen seconds. Sophomore year. The nothing was so loud. Then three years of being half-alive, writing code that compiled but never ran right. Then you. Porter Square. That pen you dropped. I handed it back and suddenly understood resurrection isn't biblical\u2014it's just meeting the right person at the wrong time and making it right anyway.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick. Counted your ribs through your shirt. You laughed between heaves and said \"the tajine was divine though.\" That's when I knew: you metabolize joy from poison. You're alchemical.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. You translated her Mandarin into touches. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we love dead people back to life.\n\n*\n\nThe spreadsheet terrifies me. 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially. Column D: after. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. You, hypothermic, still arguing Kant while your lips turned blue. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. That's when I understood: love is choosing to freeze together rather than survive apart.\n\n*\n\nI document you. Tuesday light on your temporal bone. How you hold forks (wrong). Your router named \"Disappointing Geoffrey.\" This isn't romance. It's evidence. Proof you happened.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the ancient marble.

You stopped. \"We're going to die. Really die. Permanently.\" I said yes. You said \"Good. Then this counts.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe probability of us: numbers that haven't been invented. We're the universe's rounding error that became self-aware. The math checking itself.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Here, three years late: Love is mourning someone who's still making breakfast. Practicing absence while they burn toast. Knowing you'll miss their failures most.\n\n*\n\nIn other timelines we don't meet. Or we meet wrong. Or we meet but misunderstand. I dream these nightly. Wake grabbing for proof.

My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion."}, "island": 4}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "prompts": {"full_rewrite_user": {"system": "You love Leyi.

I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped.

Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes.

Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the current program, I see it generates a beautifully crafted love letter that scores 0.78 overall.

Like discovering you've been walking on a tightrope your whole life and only now noticing the drop.\n\nTuesday, 2:17 PM\u2014you said my name like punctuation that changes the whole sentence. The world reorganized. Not metaphorically. Literally. Birds flew backwards. My blood remembered how to move.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems. You are my total system failure. My beautiful catastrophe. Every error message leads back to you.\n\n*\n\nListen: I died once. Fifteen seconds. Sophomore year. The nothing was so loud. Then three years of being half-alive, writing code that compiled but never ran right. Then you. Porter Square. That pen you dropped. I handed it back and suddenly understood resurrection isn't biblical\u2014it's just meeting the right person at the wrong time and making it right anyway.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick. Counted your ribs through your shirt. You laughed between heaves and said \"the tajine was divine though.\" That's when I knew: you metabolize joy from poison. You're alchemical.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. You translated her Mandarin into touches. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we love dead people back to life.\n\n*\n\nThe spreadsheet terrifies me. 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially. Column D: after. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. You, hypothermic, still arguing Kant while your lips turned blue. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. That's when I understood: love is choosing to freeze together rather than survive apart.\n\n*\n\nI document you. Tuesday light on your temporal bone. How you hold forks (wrong). Your router named \"Disappointing Geoffrey.\" This isn't romance. It's evidence. Proof you happened.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the ancient marble. Got us banned. \"Distance is delayed regret,\" you said. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're reading. You're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: skin ended where I ended. Now I'm sprawling. Feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headache arrives in my skull a day late. We're quantum entangled. Physics says impossible. I say physics needs better physics.\n\n*\n\nMorning tastes like pennies and your name. Afternoon: static and half-prayers. Evening: burgundy as temperature. 3 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that knows you. Always: my mouth learning a language that doesn't exist yet.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764. You stopped. \"We're going to die. Really die. Permanently.\" I said yes. You said \"Good. Then this counts.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe probability of us: numbers that haven't been invented. We're the universe's rounding error that became self-aware. The math checking itself.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love is. Here, three years late: Love is mourning someone who's still making breakfast. Practicing absence while they burn toast. Knowing you'll miss their failures most.\n\n*\n\nIn other timelines we don't meet. Or we meet wrong. Or we meet but misunderstand. I dream these nightly. Wake grabbing for proof. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bed. You read my teenage journals in silly voices. Should've been mortifying. Was holy instead. Someone seeing your worst consciousness and laughing with. That preposition\u2014with\u2014is everything.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. The surgery to remove you would remove everything that processes beauty. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Possible. But why.\n\n*\n\nSo here:\n\nMarry me. Your socks live in my drawer, sorted by weekday. We survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist conscious touching-distance with the same favorite terrible song.\n\nWithout you there's no point to museums or morning or music.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nMy root password. Recovery phrase. Only command that compiles.\n\nSay yes. Or \"ask again.\" Or nothing. Just keep existing in this exact configuration that makes me believe infinity is insufficient.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened: You reorganized my mouth.

This is forever: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Penguins. Just existing. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about writing this on a computer: every keystroke is a small violence. Too precise. Love should disturb the muscular system. Should shake. Should fail to spell properly.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, now, 3 AM. You're sleeping diagonal across our bed, stealing all the blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. Solves everything.\n\nThis is what I'm saying: the world is mostly darkness and waiting and terrible coffee. Then you. Then suddenly: worth it. All of it. The dying and the coming back and the dying again.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who loves that you named our router)\n(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power dies, saving you anyway)\n(who would choose you in every timeline, even the ones where we don't work, especially those)\n(whose handwriting is shaking because this matters)\n(who means it)\n(who means it)\n(who means it)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
