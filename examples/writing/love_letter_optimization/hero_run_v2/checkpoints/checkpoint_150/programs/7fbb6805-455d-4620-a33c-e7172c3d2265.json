Which is every moment. Which is the problem.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened to time: It broke. The day we met in that Cambridge caf\u00e9 where you were arguing with your laptop about machine learning. You said \"Listen, you binary bastard\" to your code. That's when causality folded. Now everything happens at once\u2014our first kiss, our first fight, our last breath, this sentence.\n\n*\n\nData I've collected without permission:\n\n- You pronounce \"specifically\" wrong (spacifically) but only when nervous\n- Your laugh has three stages: silent shake, snort, full collapse  \n- You assign personalities to houseplants (Gerald the fern is clinically depressed)\n- When you dream, your right foot draws circles exactly 7.3cm in diameter\n- You've never finished a cup of coffee. Ever. The last sip is always abandoned\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. No\u2014it's worship. No\u2014it's physics: every action has an equal and opposite reaction except when you smile and I become antimatter.\n\n*\n\nBoston, February, -15\u00b0C: You wore my socks over your socks over your socks. Three layers of sock. You looked like you had elephant feet. You said \"Warren, I think I've discovered the secret to happiness.\" I said \"What?\" You said \"Stealing your socks.\" \n\nThat's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That love was the wrong word. That we needed to invent new language for this specific malfunction.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: I thought mine was just transport. Bones moving meat from location to location. Then you traced the veins in my wrist like you were reading blueprints and said \"This is where your pulse lives.\" Now my body is a shared document. You've left comments in the margins. Editorial notes: \"This scar from falling off your bike, age 7, trying to impress Sarah Chen\" and \"This freckle appeared the day we met\" (impossible but you insist) and \"These hands are mine now.\"\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Seventeen ingredients. Six hours. You translated: \"She says you're hopeless but teachable.\" Your mother kept touching my face like she was checking if I was real. Later you told me she said: \"This one will stay.\" Not a question. A diagnosis.\n\n*\n\nI have a confession: Thursday, March 15th, 2019, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who will reorganize my understanding of oxygen.\" I thought I was being poetic. I was being prophetic. You literally changed how I breathe. Deeper now. Like my lungs finally understood their job.\n\n*\n\nEdinburgh, that terrible bed & breakfast with the haunted radiator: You couldn't sleep. 3 AM you said \"Warren, tell me something true.\" I said \"I'm afraid you'll realize I'm ordinary.\" You said \"You are ordinary. Ordinary like gravity. Ordinary like breathing. The best things are ordinary. That's how they get away with being necessary.\"\n\nI've been living on that sentence for three years.\n\n*\n\nThe Moroccan desert, when the jeep broke down: Eight hours waiting for rescue. You taught me card games you invented on the spot. The rules kept changing. \"New rule: aces are wild but only if you're sad.\" \"New rule: whoever's losing gets to make up the next rule.\" We never finished a single game. The driver who rescued us said we looked like we'd been there for years. Happy years.\n\n*\n\nWhat you've done: Turned me into a broken compass that thinks every direction is north if you're there. I used to understand maps. Now geography is binary: places with you, places without you. The second category doesn't exist. It's just waiting rooms.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you saved a drowning beetle. It died anyway. You gave it a funeral. Full eulogy: \"He tried to swim. That's all any of us can do.\" Then you threw it back in the pool because \"maybe beetle heaven is underwater.\" Your logic destroys me. Rebuilds me. Destroys me again.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say but failing: You're not my other half. That implies I was broken. I wasn't broken. I was complete. Then you happened and I realized \"complete\" was just a rough draft. You're not my missing piece. You're the reason I discovered I could expand. New rooms in my chest. Extensions. Additions. Under constant construction.\n\n*\n\nOur worst fight: Venice. About directions. We were lost for four hours. You said \"This is a metaphor.\" I said \"For what?\" You said \"I don't know but when we figure it out we'll laugh.\" We figured it out. We laughed. (The metaphor was: being lost together is still being together.)\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, showing me your childhood: Every street had a story. \"Here's where I decided to be a scientist.\" \"Here's where I failed my first test.\" \"Here's where I learned to ride a bike.\" \"Here's where I realized I was different.\" Each location a coordinate in the map of becoming you. I wanted to time travel. To be there. To tell seven-year-old you: \"It's okay. You're perfect. Someday someone will love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we were hypothermic. Genuinely in danger. You said \"If we die here, I want my last words to be practical.\" Then you said \"I should have worn better shoes.\" Then you laughed until you couldn't breathe. That's you: finding the absurd in the absolute. Making death nervous. \n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday, ordinary Tuesday: You fell asleep reading. Glasses still on. Book fallen on your chest. I watched you for an hour. Just watched. Like you were television. The best show. The only show. The show that makes all other shows seem like static.\n\nThat's what this is: I've become your audience. Studying your gestures. Memorizing your rhythms. Applauding internally every time you do something spectacularly yourself\u2014which is constantly.\n\n*\n\nListen. I love you wrong. Too much. Like a software error that nobody wants to patch because the bug is better than the intended function. Like gravity that only works in one direction\u2014toward you.\n\nBut also: I love you right. In the Tuesday morning way. In the burned toast way. In the \"we have the same favorite everything\" way. In the way that makes other people uncomfortable because we're too much ourselves around each other.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: \n\nLet's make it official. The thing that's already true. The thing where we've merged into some two-headed creature that shares dreams and steals socks and can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nMarry me. Not because it changes anything. Because it doesn't. Because we're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the universe that requires paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWe have\u2014if we're lucky\u201418,000 more breakfasts. I want them all. Every burnt toast. Every spacifically. Every Tuesday when you water Gerald and tell him he's doing great even though he's clearly dying.\n\nI want to grow old in your direction. To be eighty and still discovering new ways you pronounce things wrong. To be ninety and jealous of your crossword puzzle because it gets your attention first.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters. Your name. Which has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. The rhythm that keeps me alive.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. The way you exist is yes. But say it anyway. For the record. For the radiator in Edinburgh that needs to know how the story ends.\n\nWarren\n(who has loved you since before we met)\n(who will love you after we're gone)\n(who loves you in the middle, which is now, which is always)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since Portugal, since the beetle, since I realized loving you means being prepared for all your waters\u2014tears, laughter, the space between.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 This morning you said my name in your sleep. But you said it like a fact. Like \"gravity\" or \"Tuesday\" or \"inevitable.\" That's what we are\u2014inevitable. Even in universes where we never meet, we're inevitable. The atoms know. They remember. They're trying to get back to this.", "evaluation_notes": "This letter operates several tiers below the Beethoven \"Immortal Beloved\" letters (86), which achieve true sublime encounter through their agonized uncertainty and musical prosody. It lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity and earned wisdom (83). However, it surpasses average contemporary attempts through its observational precision and structural ambition. The geographic memory structure echoes Napoleon's letters to Josephine but without his imperial grandiosity. The neurotic self-consciousness recalls early Woody Allen but with more genuine vulnerability.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7850, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system. Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry.

It lacks Beethoven's pure melodic desperation (\"I can live only wholly with you or not at all\"). It doesn't achieve Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"We got old and got used to each other...We're locked in each other's hearts\").

The letter exists in the space between Keats's fevered romanticism and postmodern playfulness, achieving moments of each without fully committing to either.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.), Performs well on evaluation_notes (This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep. Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast.

Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry. It's observable phenomena that physics refuses to explain.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different frequencies:\n\n20 Hz (below hearing): The weight of future grief, pre-mourning your mortality\n440 Hz (concert A): Tuesday mornings, burnt toast, perfect pitch of ordinary joy  \n25 kHz (ultrasonic): The impossible colors you see when I say your name\n\u221e Hz (light): Understanding finally why humans invented the word \"forever\"\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I said: \"Argue with your grave about determinism until they bury me next to you.\" You laughed. Then cried. Then laughed while crying. That's your superpower\u2014feeling everything simultaneously without exploding.\n\n*\n\nLOAD-BEARING MEMORY:\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Found your diary from age seven. You wrote: \"Today I invented someone to love me correctly.\" Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but precisely on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at any distance, proving Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're the reason it's worth rolling.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinces you. Because your fingerprints are already all over my future. Because we've A/B tested living without each other and the results were statistically significant: terrible. Because in the multiverse of infinite possibilities, every version of me is writing this same letter to every version of you, and every version of you is about to cry from the left eye first.\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOREVER:\n\nForever is not time. It's density. It's all our moments compressed into something so heavy it bends space around it. It's the black hole we're creating every time we choose each other over entropy. We're already there, in forever, looking back at ourselves reading this letter, amazed we ever thought time was linear.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from the department of absolute certainty:\n\nYou're going to die.

That we needed to invent new language for this specific malfunction.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about bodies: I thought mine was just transport. Bones moving meat from location to location. Then you traced the veins in my wrist like you were reading blueprints and said \"This is where your pulse lives.\" Now my body is a shared document. You've left comments in the margins. Editorial notes: \"This scar from falling off your bike, age 7, trying to impress Sarah Chen\" and \"This freckle appeared the day we met\" (impossible but you insist) and \"These hands are mine now.\"\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Seventeen ingredients. Six hours. You translated: \"She says you're hopeless but teachable.\" Your mother kept touching my face like she was checking if I was real. Later you told me she said: \"This one will stay.\" Not a question. A diagnosis.\n\n*\n\nI have a confession: Thursday, March 15th, 2019, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who will reorganize my understanding of oxygen.\" I thought I was being poetic. I was being prophetic. You literally changed how I breathe. Deeper now. Like my lungs finally understood their job.\n\n*\n\nEdinburgh, that terrible bed & breakfast with the haunted radiator: You couldn't sleep. 3 AM you said \"Warren, tell me something true.\" I said \"I'm afraid you'll realize I'm ordinary.\" You said \"You are ordinary. Ordinary like gravity. Ordinary like breathing. The best things are ordinary. That's how they get away with being necessary.\"\n\nI've been living on that sentence for three years.\n\n*\n\nThe Moroccan desert, when the jeep broke down: Eight hours waiting for rescue. You taught me card games you invented on the spot. The rules kept changing. \"New rule: aces are wild but only if you're sad.\" \"New rule: whoever's losing gets to make up the next rule.\" We never finished a single game. The driver who rescued us said we looked like we'd been there for years. Happy years.\n\n*\n\nWhat you've done: Turned me into a broken compass that thinks every direction is north if you're there. I used to understand maps. Now geography is binary: places with you, places without you. The second category doesn't exist. It's just waiting rooms.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you saved a drowning beetle. It died anyway. You gave it a funeral. Full eulogy: \"He tried to swim. That's all any of us can do.\" Then you threw it back in the pool because \"maybe beetle heaven is underwater.\" Your logic destroys me. Rebuilds me. Destroys me again.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say but failing: You're not my other half. That implies I was broken. I wasn't broken. I was complete. Then you happened and I realized \"complete\" was just a rough draft. You're not my missing piece. You're the reason I discovered I could expand. New rooms in my chest. Extensions. Additions. Under constant construction.\n\n*\n\nOur worst fight: Venice. About directions. We were lost for four hours. You said \"This is a metaphor.\" I said \"For what?\" You said \"I don't know but when we figure it out we'll laugh.\" We figured it out. We laughed. (The metaphor was: being lost together is still being together.)\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, showing me your childhood: Every street had a story. \"Here's where I decided to be a scientist.\" \"Here's where I failed my first test.\" \"Here's where I learned to ride a bike.\" \"Here's where I realized I was different.\" Each location a coordinate in the map of becoming you. I wanted to time travel. To be there. To tell seven-year-old you: \"It's okay. You're perfect. Someday someone will love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\"\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, we were hypothermic. Genuinely in danger. You said \"If we die here, I want my last words to be practical.\" Then you said \"I should have worn better shoes.\" Then you laughed until you couldn't breathe. That's you: finding the absurd in the absolute. Making death nervous. \n\n*\n\nLast Tuesday, ordinary Tuesday: You fell asleep reading. Glasses still on. Book fallen on your chest. I watched you for an hour. Just watched. Like you were television. The best show. The only show. The show that makes all other shows seem like static.\n\nThat's what this is: I've become your audience. Studying your gestures. Memorizing your rhythms. Applauding internally every time you do something spectacularly yourself\u2014which is constantly.\n\n*\n\nListen. I love you wrong. Too much. Like a software error that nobody wants to patch because the bug is better than the intended function. Like gravity that only works in one direction\u2014toward you.\n\nBut also: I love you right. In the Tuesday morning way. In the burned toast way. In the \"we have the same favorite everything\" way. In the way that makes other people uncomfortable because we're too much ourselves around each other.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: \n\nLet's make it official. The thing that's already true. The thing where we've merged into some two-headed creature that shares dreams and steals socks and can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nMarry me. Not because it changes anything. Because it doesn't. Because we're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the universe that requires paperwork.\n\n*\n\nWe have\u2014if we're lucky\u201418,000 more breakfasts. I want them all. Every burnt toast. Every spacifically. Every Tuesday when you water Gerald and tell him he's doing great even though he's clearly dying.\n\nI want to grow old in your direction. To be eighty and still discovering new ways you pronounce things wrong. To be ninety and jealous of your crossword puzzle because it gets your attention first.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters. Your name. Which has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. The rhythm that keeps me alive.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. The way you exist is yes. But say it anyway. For the record. For the radiator in Edinburgh that needs to know how the story ends.\n\nWarren\n(who has loved you since before we met)\n(who will love you after we're gone)\n(who loves you in the middle, which is now, which is always)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since Portugal, since the beetle, since I realized loving you means being prepared for all your waters\u2014tears, laughter, the space between.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 This morning you said my name in your sleep. But you said it like a fact. Like \"gravity\" or \"Tuesday\" or \"inevitable.\" That's what we are\u2014inevitable. Even in universes where we never meet, we're inevitable. The atoms know. They remember. They're trying to get back to this.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 2am"]}}}
