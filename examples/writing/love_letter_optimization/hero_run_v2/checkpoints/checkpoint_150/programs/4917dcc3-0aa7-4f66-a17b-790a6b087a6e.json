They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.\n\n*\n\nFirst equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat.

This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space.

Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.\n\n*\n\nFirst equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat. Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back\u2014you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced \"Bayes' theorem\" and my debt suddenly had a name.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:\n\n\u2014 The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM\n\u2014 Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)\n\u2014 That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine\n\u2014 The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence. This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space. But sometimes atoms collide and make something impossible. Stars. DNA. Tuesday afternoons where you exist and know my name.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the collision that created everything else.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. \n\nI'll translate the silence. I've been studying your silences for 1,847 days.\n\nThis one means you're crying.\n\nLeft eye first.\n\nWarren\n(who's been carrying tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins and I realized my atoms had been waiting four billion years to hand you Kleenex)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. Two extra seconds of nothing that taught me what something means. I came back for the specific brown your eyes turn before crying. That brown doesn't exist in any catalog. I checked. I had to live just to prove it real.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 The hair tie is in my desk drawer. Second one from top.
