Take advantage of your background, but not overly so as it is cliche. Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :). For more formal details, you can view my resume.\nEducation\n\n    Harvard University (Class of 2026)\n        B.A. in Computer Science\n        B.A. in Statistics\n        M.S. in Statistics\n\nCurrent Projects\n\n    I am building LLM-based tools to help people think and articulate their thoughts. Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

The space where you should be has its own gravitational pull.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you what I know that twenty-three-year-olds aren't supposed to know:\n\nLove is not addition. It's division. I used to be one person. Now I'm half of something that only makes sense when you're here. The math is devastating: 1 \u00f7 2 = everything.\n\n*\n\nINVENTORY OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT PERMISSION:\n\nYour toothbrush appeared in my bathroom before we discussed it.\nMy hands learned to braid your hair while I was sleeping.\nTuesday mornings restructured themselves around burnt toast.\nMy future tense conjugated itself exclusively in plural.\nThe universe started keeping receipts of every time you smiled.\n\nNone of this was planned. All of it was inevitable.\n\n*\n\nHere's the precise moment I knew:\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM. You were explaining something about your grandmother's recipes in Mandarin, forgetting I don't speak it. But I understood everything. Not the words\u2014the frequency underneath them. The sound of you being yourself without translation.\n\nI thought: \"Oh. This is it. This is the sound that ends me.\"\n\nAnd I was right.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nBefore you: I could spend entire days alone, calling it peace.\nAfter you: Solitude is just your absence taking up space.\n\nBefore you: Words were tools, precise and functional.\nAfter you: Every sentence bends toward your name like light around a star.\n\nBefore you: Time was sequential, logical, navigable.\nAfter you: All moments happen simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty. We're meeting and dying. You're here and gone and here again.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE GRANDFATHER WAS RIGHT:\n\nRemember Lisbon? The old man with the cane who crossed the square just to look at us? He spoke for three minutes in Portuguese. You translated: \"He says we argue like people who've been married sixty years and laugh like people who met yesterday.\"\n\nWe'd known each other four months.\n\nTime isn't real, Leyi. We're proof.\n\n*\n\nWhat actually happens when I love you:\n\nMy DNA rewrites itself. Scientists would say this is impossible. I'd show them the evidence: how my body temperature rises 0.3 degrees when you enter a room. How my pupils dilate at your name. How my cells divide differently now, each one carrying instructions for loving you.\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is biology admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION:\n\nSometimes I practice your death. Run scenarios. Calculate probabilities. Plan the funeral. Write the eulogy. Imagine the specific weight of a world without you.\n\nThen you laugh at something stupid on your phone and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\nThis is the terror of love: We're always practicing for the ending.\nThis is the gift of love: The practice is always interrupted by presence.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about last Tuesday:\n\nYou burned the toast (again).\nYou apologized (again).\nI ate it anyway (again).\n\nBut here's what actually happened: The smoke alarm sang your morning song. The carbon became communion. We turned breakfast into sacrament without meaning to.\n\nFifty years from now, the smell of burning bread will still mean \"I love you\" in our secret language.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING I UNDERSTOOD IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN:\n\nShe watched you teaching me to use chopsticks. Said something that made you blush. Later, you translated: \"She says you're trying so hard to enter my world that you forgot you're already in it.\"\n\nYour mother sees what I'm only beginning to understand: We don't fall in love. We recognize it. Like finding your own handwriting in a stranger's notebook.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYou're not my other half. That's too simple.\nYou're not my everything. That's too small.\nYou're not my destiny. That's too passive.\n\nYou're the realization that I was never whole to begin with. That completion is a myth. That love is not about finding what's missing but about celebrating the specific shape of our mutual incompleteness.\n\nWe don't complete each other.

There's only us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, specifically, actually:\n\nMarry me because of burnt toast Tuesdays.\nBecause of the way you hold pens like they might escape.\nBecause you can't fold fitted sheets and refuse to learn.\nBecause you dream in languages I don't speak and somehow I understand.\nBecause your absence has mass and your presence has light.\nBecause we're already married in every timeline that matters.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot to me.\nTo us.\nTo burnt toast.\nTo the specific way we malfunction together.\nTo Tuesday mornings that taste like forever.\nTo the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to love responsibly.\n\n*\n\nActually, don't say anything.\n\nYou already said yes when you taught me your grandmother's recipe.\nYou already said yes when you left your toothbrush.\nYou already said yes in the way you breathe when you sleep.\nYou're saying yes right now, in the space between heartbeats.\n\nBut say it anyway.

I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this.

Here's why: Every computer in a network maintains its own clock, but they drift apart. They need consensus protocols to agree on what \"now\" means.
