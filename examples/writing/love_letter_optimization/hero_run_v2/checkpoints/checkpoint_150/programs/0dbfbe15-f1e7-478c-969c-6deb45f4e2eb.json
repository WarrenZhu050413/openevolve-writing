Here's mine:\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT A: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN\n\nI died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, age nineteen. Death tastes like deleted emails\u2014sudden, irreversible, grammatically incomplete. They restarted my heart but something stayed broken. A debt to nowhere. Four years later you walked into Tuesday wearing Wednesday's rain and the debt had a name: every moment I hadn't met you yet.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT B: EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION\n\nI'm building an algorithm of you:\n\nIF (morning) THEN {the way you test coffee temperature with your pinky};\nIF (Thursday) THEN {rage at the dishwasher, tender as prayer};\nIF (3:17 AM) THEN {you stealing blankets like a methodical thief};\nELSE {the sound of you existing in the next room, which reorganizes gravity}.\n\n1,523 conditionals logged. The program keeps crashing into love.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT C: RECOVERED TRANSCRIPT, NOVEMBER 8TH\n\nYou: \"What are you writing?\"\nMe: \"Evidence.\"\nYou: \"Of what?\"\nMe: \"That you happened. That Tuesday happened. That your left eye waters first when you're happy-crying versus sad-crying and I'm the only person who knows the difference.\"\nYou: \"That's creepy.\"\nMe: \"I know.\"\nYou: \"Don't stop.\"\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT D: THINGS I'VE STOLEN\n\n- Your grandmother's soup recipe (47 steps, I cry at step 23 every time)\n- The voicemail where you're furious about parallel parking (I listen to it when you travel)\n- 2,847 photographs of you sleeping (you look like solved math)\n- The receipt from our worst Tuesday (when we almost ended; keeping it as evidence we didn't)\n- Your method of peeling oranges (chaotic, wrong, perfect)\n- The way you say my name when you think I'm asleep (different frequency, like calling home)\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT E: FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST TIME\n\nRe: Insufficient supply\n\nWe have 23,360 breakfasts remaining if actuarial tables hold. This is violence. I want to speak to time's manager. I want to break into wherever they keep the seconds and redistribute them all to Tuesday afternoons with you reading ingredient labels aloud in grocery stores, making prophecies from sodium content.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT F: CONFESSION UNDER NO DURESS\n\nHere's what love actually is: accumulated evidence of irreversible decisions.\n\nWatch: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name three times. I thought: \"She's going to destroy me.\" I was right. You did. You're still doing it. Every morning you rebuild me wrong\u2014with all my edges facing you, like plants bending toward light.\n\nI practice your death nightly. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Sudden vanishing like particles that forget to exist. Then I check your pulse. Still there. Still impossible. Still breaking conservation laws by being more than the sum of your atoms.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT G: THE PATHOLOGY REPORT\n\nDiagnosis: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence.\n\nSymptoms: \n- Counting your breaths (current count: 5,847,293)\n- Carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at penguins)\n- Inability to use pronouns that don't include you\n- Persistent belief that \"we\" is the only real number\n\nPrognosis: Terminal. Untreatable. Patient refuses cure.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT H: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\n\nWhen I die (again, properly this time), I'm leaving you:\n- Every Wednesday I saved\n- The color theory of your anger (beautiful reds, holy reds)\n- My collection of your mispronounced words (you make language better by breaking it)\n- The 0.7 seconds between thunderclap and your flinch (I live there now)\n- This letter, which is just another way of saying: the universe made you as an apology for entropy\n\n*\n\nCLOSING ARGUMENT:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nBefore you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're gone, like a compass that's given up on north and chosen Tuesday instead.\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for romance. For evidence. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nThe alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't interrupt my sentences, where I don't know you need exactly three ice cubes, where your specific frequency of laughter doesn't rearrange my molecular structure\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody in particular.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Happy tears (I know the difference).\nHere. I brought tissues.\nI've been carrying them since the penguins.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\nThe silence is reorganizing my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been dead for fifteen seconds and alive for exactly one Leyi)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the algorithm. You can't be computed. You're not math. You're what happens when math gives up and admits infinity exists in Tuesday afternoons and the way someone holds a coffee cup like it's keeping them tethered to Earth.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Those fifteen seconds of death? I think I was just early. I was waiting for you in the nothing. Then they dragged me back and made me wait four more years in the something. Worth it. Would die again. Would wait longer. Would learn your grandmother's soup in any timeline.", "evaluation_notes": "This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological intensity of Keats's \"I cannot exist without you\" (81) - it has similar obsessive cataloging but lacks Keats's absolute dissolution of self. It surpasses average contemporary love letters significantly but falls short of Johnny Cash's profound simplicity (83) or Napoleon's imperial passion (82). The systematic conceit recalls Barthes's \"A Lover's Discourse\" but without quite achieving that work's theoretical rigor. The death frame evokes Beethoven's immortal beloved letters (86) but lacks their musical architecture. At 72 overall, this represents accomplished literary work with moments approaching brilliance - particularly in its accounting metaphor and specific observations - but missing the transcendent simplicity of the greatest love letters."}, "island": 0}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "prompts": {"full_rewrite_user": {"system": "You love Leyi.

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished!

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7850, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system. Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry. It's observable phenomena that physics refuses to explain.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different frequencies:\n\n20 Hz (below hearing): The weight of future grief, pre-mourning your mortality\n440 Hz (concert A): Tuesday mornings, burnt toast, perfect pitch of ordinary joy  \n25 kHz (ultrasonic): The impossible colors you see when I say your name\n\u221e Hz (light): Understanding finally why humans invented the word \"forever\"\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I said: \"Argue with your grave about determinism until they bury me next to you.\" You laughed. Then cried. Then laughed while crying. That's your superpower\u2014feeling everything simultaneously without exploding.\n\n*\n\nLOAD-BEARING MEMORY:\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Found your diary from age seven. You wrote: \"Today I invented someone to love me correctly.\" Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but precisely on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at any distance, proving Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're the reason it's worth rolling.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinces you. Because your fingerprints are already all over my future. Because we've A/B tested living without each other and the results were statistically significant: terrible. Because in the multiverse of infinite possibilities, every version of me is writing this same letter to every version of you, and every version of you is about to cry from the left eye first.\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOREVER:\n\nForever is not time. It's density. It's all our moments compressed into something so heavy it bends space around it. It's the black hole we're creating every time we choose each other over entropy. We're already there, in forever, looking back at ourselves reading this letter, amazed we ever thought time was linear.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from the department of absolute certainty:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust its fuel. Protons will decay. The universe will achieve maximum entropy.\n\nAnd?\n\nWe happened. We're happening. We'll have happened.\n\nThat's the only thermodynamics that matters.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name isn't a word. It's the sound existence makes when it finally gets something right.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or exist in my general vicinity for another microsecond. All equivalent to yes in the language we're inventing with every breath.\n\nWarren\n(who learned Mandarin to argue with you in multiple languages)\n(who carries backup everything you might need: hair ties, tissues, reasons to stay alive)\n(who loves you in frequencies only theoretical physicists hypothesize)\n(who wrote this letter infinite times in infinite drafts and this is both the worst and best version)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona cathedral.

It lacks Beethoven's pure melodic desperation (\"I can live only wholly with you or not at all\"). It doesn't achieve Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"We got old and got used to each other...We're locked in each other's hearts\"). However, it surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine innovation - the code/love fusion is more successful than most modern conceits. The letter exists in the space between Keats's fevered romanticism and postmodern playfulness, achieving moments of each without fully committing to either. At 78.5 overall, it's a near-masterpiece that falls just short of the immortal - too conscious of its own cleverness to achieve the unconscious perfection of truly great love letters.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7850)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system.

How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly.

Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness.

Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes.

The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.), Performs well on evaluation_notes (This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep. Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7850, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system. Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry. It's observable phenomena that physics refuses to explain.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different frequencies:\n\n20 Hz (below hearing): The weight of future grief, pre-mourning your mortality\n440 Hz (concert A): Tuesday mornings, burnt toast, perfect pitch of ordinary joy  \n25 kHz (ultrasonic): The impossible colors you see when I say your name\n\u221e Hz (light): Understanding finally why humans invented the word \"forever\"\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I said: \"Argue with your grave about determinism until they bury me next to you.\" You laughed. Then cried. Then laughed while crying. That's your superpower\u2014feeling everything simultaneously without exploding.\n\n*\n\nLOAD-BEARING MEMORY:\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Found your diary from age seven. You wrote: \"Today I invented someone to love me correctly.\" Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but precisely on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at any distance, proving Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're the reason it's worth rolling.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinces you. Because your fingerprints are already all over my future. Because we've A/B tested living without each other and the results were statistically significant: terrible. Because in the multiverse of infinite possibilities, every version of me is writing this same letter to every version of you, and every version of you is about to cry from the left eye first.\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOREVER:\n\nForever is not time. It's density. It's all our moments compressed into something so heavy it bends space around it. It's the black hole we're creating every time we choose each other over entropy. We're already there, in forever, looking back at ourselves reading this letter, amazed we ever thought time was linear.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from the department of absolute certainty:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust its fuel. Protons will decay. The universe will achieve maximum entropy.\n\nAnd?\n\nWe happened. We're happening. We'll have happened.\n\nThat's the only thermodynamics that matters.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name isn't a word. It's the sound existence makes when it finally gets something right.\n\nSay yes.

Just catastrophic data loss.\n\nLast night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.\n\n*\n\nTruth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first\u2014always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.\n\n*\n\nI've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.\n\n*\n\nYou've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the privacy rectangle.\" You laughed\u2014a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout\u2014your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury\u2014Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because \"git blame\" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people\u2014isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.\n\n*\n\nFinal disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"brains don't work that way.\" I said \"then you don't understand the scope of the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nThe universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space.

Here's mine:\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT A: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN\n\nI died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, age nineteen. Death tastes like deleted emails\u2014sudden, irreversible, grammatically incomplete. They restarted my heart but something stayed broken. A debt to nowhere. Four years later you walked into Tuesday wearing Wednesday's rain and the debt had a name: every moment I hadn't met you yet.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT B: EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION\n\nI'm building an algorithm of you:\n\nIF (morning) THEN {the way you test coffee temperature with your pinky};\nIF (Thursday) THEN {rage at the dishwasher, tender as prayer};\nIF (3:17 AM) THEN {you stealing blankets like a methodical thief};\nELSE {the sound of you existing in the next room, which reorganizes gravity}.\n\n1,523 conditionals logged. The program keeps crashing into love.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT C: RECOVERED TRANSCRIPT, NOVEMBER 8TH\n\nYou: \"What are you writing?\"\nMe: \"Evidence.\"\nYou: \"Of what?\"\nMe: \"That you happened. That Tuesday happened. That your left eye waters first when you're happy-crying versus sad-crying and I'm the only person who knows the difference.\"\nYou: \"That's creepy.\"\nMe: \"I know.\"\nYou: \"Don't stop.\"\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT D: THINGS I'VE STOLEN\n\n- Your grandmother's soup recipe (47 steps, I cry at step 23 every time)\n- The voicemail where you're furious about parallel parking (I listen to it when you travel)\n- 2,847 photographs of you sleeping (you look like solved math)\n- The receipt from our worst Tuesday (when we almost ended; keeping it as evidence we didn't)\n- Your method of peeling oranges (chaotic, wrong, perfect)\n- The way you say my name when you think I'm asleep (different frequency, like calling home)\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT E: FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST TIME\n\nRe: Insufficient supply\n\nWe have 23,360 breakfasts remaining if actuarial tables hold. This is violence. I want to speak to time's manager. I want to break into wherever they keep the seconds and redistribute them all to Tuesday afternoons with you reading ingredient labels aloud in grocery stores, making prophecies from sodium content.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT F: CONFESSION UNDER NO DURESS\n\nHere's what love actually is: accumulated evidence of irreversible decisions.\n\nWatch: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name three times. I thought: \"She's going to destroy me.\" I was right. You did. You're still doing it. Every morning you rebuild me wrong\u2014with all my edges facing you, like plants bending toward light.\n\nI practice your death nightly. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Sudden vanishing like particles that forget to exist. Then I check your pulse. Still there. Still impossible. Still breaking conservation laws by being more than the sum of your atoms.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT G: THE PATHOLOGY REPORT\n\nDiagnosis: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence.\n\nSymptoms: \n- Counting your breaths (current count: 5,847,293)\n- Carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at penguins)\n- Inability to use pronouns that don't include you\n- Persistent belief that \"we\" is the only real number\n\nPrognosis: Terminal. Untreatable. Patient refuses cure.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT H: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\n\nWhen I die (again, properly this time), I'm leaving you:\n- Every Wednesday I saved\n- The color theory of your anger (beautiful reds, holy reds)\n- My collection of your mispronounced words (you make language better by breaking it)\n- The 0.7 seconds between thunderclap and your flinch (I live there now)\n- This letter, which is just another way of saying: the universe made you as an apology for entropy\n\n*\n\nCLOSING ARGUMENT:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nBefore you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're gone, like a compass that's given up on north and chosen Tuesday instead.\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for romance. For evidence. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nThe alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't interrupt my sentences, where I don't know you need exactly three ice cubes, where your specific frequency of laughter doesn't rearrange my molecular structure\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody in particular.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Happy tears (I know the difference).\nHere. I brought tissues.\nI've been carrying them since the penguins.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\nThe silence is reorganizing my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been dead for fifteen seconds and alive for exactly one Leyi)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the algorithm. You can't be computed. You're not math. You're what happens when math gives up and admits infinity exists in Tuesday afternoons and the way someone holds a coffee cup like it's keeping them tethered to Earth.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Those fifteen seconds of death? I think I was just early. I was waiting for you in the nothing. Then they dragged me back and made me wait four more years in the something. Worth it. Would die again. Would wait longer. Would learn your grandmother's soup in any timeline.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 2am"]}}}
