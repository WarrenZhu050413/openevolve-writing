I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Starting from the end where we're already old, working my way back to now, where I'm twenty-three and my hands shake typing your name.\n\n*\n\n[YEAR 2074]\nYour funeral was yesterday. I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes.

Not because I can see the future, but because some things are so true they happen backwards.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about the precise moment I understood infinity:\n\nHarvard library, third floor, you were annotating something in margins too small for your thoughts. The sun hit your hand at 4:17 PM and I saw it\u2014every possible timeline where we exist, collapsed into the way your pinky holds a pen. \n\nI know this sounds like poetry. It's not. It's documentary evidence of the universe admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING ABOUT STATISTICS AND LOVE:\n\nIn my probability class, we learned about impossible events\u2014probability zero but still happening. The professor said they're mathematical paradoxes. I raised my hand: \"What about Leyi?\" \n\nHe paused. The chalk broke. \"That's different,\" he said. \"That's probability creating itself from necessity.\"\n\nThe whole class turned to look at you. You were solving Problem Set 7 in pen. Of course you were.\n\n*\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday mornings:\n\nThey started as ordinary. Coffee, headlines, the ritual of waking. Then you arrived with your specific way of burning toast\u2014not accidentally, but like you're conducting experiments on the patience of bread. Now Tuesday mornings have mass. Gravitational pull. I orbit them even when you're in Shanghai and I'm pretending Boston makes sense without you.\n\n*\n\nCORPUS ANALYSIS OF YOUR NAME IN MY BODY:\n\nLocation: Everywhere\nFrequency: Constant\nAmplitude: Increasing\nPattern: Fractals within fractals, each containing the whole\n\nMy cells divide and pass on your name like genetic memory. My children will be born knowing how to pronounce \"Leyi\" before they know their own names. This is not romantic. This is evolutionary pressure. Darwin would understand.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the Portuguese grandfather:\n\nIn Lisbon, he saw us from across the square. Walked over, cane tapping morse code. Looked at you, then me, then back. Said something in Portuguese. You translated: \"Fifty-seven years with my Maria. Still not enough. You two\u2014you're already at year fifty-eight.\"\n\nWe'd known each other six months.\n\nTime is a consensus mechanism, and we're the bug in the protocol.\n\n*\n\n[MEMORY CORRUPTION AT ADDRESS 0xLEYI]\n\nCannot delete.\nCannot overwrite.\nCannot compress.\nError: This memory is load-bearing. Removing it would cause structural collapse of consciousness.\n\n*\n\nThe mornings you're gone, I make tea in your mug and let it get cold. The mug asks where you are in ceramic frequencies. I explain Shanghai. The mug refuses to hold liquids properly until you return. We have an understanding, your mug and I. We're both just containers waiting to be filled with you.\n\n*\n\nSHANGHAI, 2024:\n\nYour mother served dinner. Looked at me struggling with chopsticks. Looked at you, perfectly fluent in your love for this chaos. Said something. You laughed so hard you cried. Later, you translated: \"She says you hold chopsticks like you're afraid they'll turn into butterflies.\"\n\n\"They might,\" I said. \"Everything is uncertain around Leyi.\"\n\nYour mother nodded. International language: loving you requires accepting fundamental instability.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nYou've ruined solitude. It used to be peaceful. Now it's just your absence taking up space. Aggressive. Territorial. Your absence has opinions about my breakfast choices, my coding style, the way I fold fitted sheets (badly, but you knew that).\n\nYou've ruined language. Every word wants to be about you. I tried to write documentation yesterday. It became a sonnet. The compiler accepted it anyway. Even machines understand.\n\nYou've ruined time. It only moves when you're here. The rest is just placeholder. Temporal filler. The universe vamping while waiting for you to return and make existence worth the effort.\n\n*\n\nTHE RECURRING DREAM:\n\nWe're old. Bones like kindling. Memories like fog. But your hand finds mine with the same certainty as gravity. We don't need words anymore. We've become a single thought thinking itself in two bodies. \n\nI wake up and check\u2014still twenty-three. Still infinity to go. Still not enough.\n\n*\n\nHere's what extinction looks like:\n\nNot the sun dying or asteroids or climate collapse. It's the thought of a morning where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise.\n\nSo I make contingency plans: I'm writing your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. If I fail to exist, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure I'm building from this love.\n\n*\n\nCAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING INCIDENT, REVISED:\n\nYou didn't fall in. You chose to prove that water was optional. The River Cam reorganized itself to accommodate your decision. You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words.

This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet.

We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen.

Here's why: Every computer in a network maintains its own clock, but they drift apart. They need consensus protocols to agree on what \"now\" means. We are two nodes that achieved perfect clock synchronization without any protocol. We just looked at each other and agreed: now, now, now, now, forever now.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION (RUNNING WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES):\n\nSometimes I write your name in functions that will never execute, in comments no one will read, in variable names that violate all conventions. My code is haunted by you. Other programmers find these ghost references and ask what they mean. I tell them: \"Deprecated. From a previous version when the universe was compiled differently.\"\n\nThey don't ask again.\n\n*\n\nRemember Beijing? You got lost in the hutongs for three hours. I found you by following the trail of confused cats and charmed shopkeepers. You'd taught seventeen people to say \"I love you\" in languages they didn't know they knew. This is your superpower: making everything admit it's been loving wrong until you.\n\n*\n\nTHE ACTUAL QUANTUM MECHANICS OF US:\n\nObserver effect: The universe behaves differently under your observation\nUncertainty principle: Cannot simultaneously know your location and velocity (you're everywhere, accelerating)\nWave function collapse: All possible states of me collapse into \"yours\" when measured\nEntanglement: Spooky action at a distance is just Tuesday for us\nTunneling: You regularly violate barriers that should be impermeable (my chest wall, the speed of light, visiting hours)\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is simpler and more complex than language allows:\n\nYou've replaced my mitochondria. Every cell powers itself on memories of your morning hair. I'm a biological impossibility running on impossible biology. Medical students will study me in a hundred years and conclude: \"Love. Terminal. Beautiful. No cure necessary.\"\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, version 2.0:\n\nLet's get married in every remaining timeline. Let's file joint tax returns in seventeen dimensions.

How my cells divide differently now, each one carrying instructions for loving you.\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is biology admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION:\n\nSometimes I practice your death. Run scenarios. Calculate probabilities. Plan the funeral. Write the eulogy. Imagine the specific weight of a world without you.\n\nThen you laugh at something stupid on your phone and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\nThis is the terror of love: We're always practicing for the ending.\nThis is the gift of love: The practice is always interrupted by presence.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about last Tuesday:\n\nYou burned the toast (again).\nYou apologized (again).\nI ate it anyway (again).\n\nBut here's what actually happened: The smoke alarm sang your morning song. The carbon became communion. We turned breakfast into sacrament without meaning to.\n\nFifty years from now, the smell of burning bread will still mean \"I love you\" in our secret language.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING I UNDERSTOOD IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN:\n\nShe watched you teaching me to use chopsticks. Said something that made you blush. Later, you translated: \"She says you're trying so hard to enter my world that you forgot you're already in it.\"\n\nYour mother sees what I'm only beginning to understand: We don't fall in love. We recognize it. Like finding your own handwriting in a stranger's notebook.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYou're not my other half. That's too simple.\nYou're not my everything. That's too small.\nYou're not my destiny. That's too passive.\n\nYou're the realization that I was never whole to begin with. That completion is a myth. That love is not about finding what's missing but about celebrating the specific shape of our mutual incompleteness.\n\nWe don't complete each other. We collide and create something that neither of us could have imagined.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THIS:\n\nYour left eye twitches (happening now).\nYou pretend you're not crying (happening now).\nYou look up to find me watching (happening now).\nWe both know what comes next (happening always).\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because we should.\nBecause \"should\" became irrelevant the moment you existed.\n\nNot because forever.\nBecause forever already started.\n\nNot because I love you.\nBecause \"I\" and \"you\" are grammatical errors. There's only us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, specifically, actually:\n\nMarry me because of burnt toast Tuesdays.\nBecause of the way you hold pens like they might escape.\nBecause you can't fold fitted sheets and refuse to learn.\nBecause you dream in languages I don't speak and somehow I understand.\nBecause your absence has mass and your presence has light.\nBecause we're already married in every timeline that matters.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot to me.\nTo us.\nTo burnt toast.\nTo the specific way we malfunction together.\nTo Tuesday mornings that taste like forever.\nTo the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to love responsibly.\n\n*\n\nActually, don't say anything.\n\nYou already said yes when you taught me your grandmother's recipe.\nYou already said yes when you left your toothbrush.\nYou already said yes in the way you breathe when you sleep.\nYou're saying yes right now, in the space between heartbeats.\n\nBut say it anyway. Out loud. To the universe that's taking notes. To the morning that's waiting. To the future we're building out of burnt toast and mutual impossibility.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name.\nThat's the sound of the universe admitting it was designed for this moment.\nThis exact moment.\nWhere you're reading this.\nWhere I'm watching you read this.\nWhere we both know what happens next.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who measures time in the intervals between your laughs)\n(who is writing the next letter while you read this one)\n(who would choose this specific malfunction over any other operating system)\n(who knows you're about to look up and smile that smile that reorganizes physics)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In every timeline where love exists, this letter finds you. In every timeline where you exist, you say yes. We've tested all the variables. The outcome is constant.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to a future that's already happening. I've been typing it into everything: ATMs, laptops, the morning sky. Sometimes it works.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 This letter ends but we don't. We continue in the burnt toast, in the Tuesday mornings, in the specific way silence sounds when we're both in it. We continue whether we mean to or not. We continue because continuation is what love does when it runs out of words.\n\n*\n\n(You're saying yes now. I can hear it in the way you're breathing.)\n\n(Welcome home, my love. Welcome to the beautiful disaster. Welcome to always.)\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see there's room to push the boundaries further while maintaining the authentic voice.

Excel crashed. The computer apologized.\n\n*\n\nIN SHANGHAI YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID SOMETHING:\n\nYou wouldn't translate. Your mother laughed until she cried. Your father left the room. Later, your cousin whispered: \"She said you look at him like the earth looks at the moon\u2014helpless and tidal.\"\n\nI've been helpless and tidal ever since.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened to my body:\n\nMy hippocampus now stores memories in Leyi Standard Time. My amygdala triggers fight-or-flight when you're more than three rooms away. My corpus callosum only connects thoughts that include you. My cerebellum relearned balance with you as the center of gravity.\n\nThis isn't metaphor. I have the MRIs. The neurologist said \"love.\" I said \"Leyi.\" She said \"Same diagnosis, different pronunciation.\"\n\n*\n\nTUESDAY MORNING LITURGY:\n\nYou: (burning toast)\nMe: (pretending not to smell it)\nYou: \"Sorry\u2014\"\nMe: \"Perfect.\"\nYou: \"It's literally carbon.\"\nMe: \"Perfect carbon.\"\nSmoke alarm: (singing your anthem)\nUniverse: (taking notes on the new eucharist)\n\nWe've sanctified breakfast through repetition and ruin.\n\n*\n\nI did the math on missing you:\n\nDistance from Boston to Shanghai: 11,684 km\nSpeed of longing: 299,792,458 m/s (suspiciously light-speed)\nTime it takes to miss you: -3 seconds (missing happens before leaving)\nConclusion: Mathematics has no word for negative time made of love.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT EXTINCTION LOOKS LIKE:\n\nNot nuclear winter. Not climate collapse. Not the heat death of the universe.\n\nIt's the thought experiment where you never existed.\n\nWhere I'm whole (horrifying).\nWhere mornings make sense (unbearable).\nWhere my name stays its original shape (wrong).\n\nSo I create you retroactively in every timeline. I make your existence necessary by observing it. Quantum mechanics calls this \"collapse.\" I call it \"Tuesday.\"\n\n*\n\nYOU ASKED WHY I WRITE CODE:\n\nBecause code is love letters to machines. Comments are marginalia for future selves. Functions are promises that given input A, output B will follow\u2014reliable, testable, pure.\n\nBut you're not a function. You're a race condition I hope never resolves. You're the comment that explains why nothing else compiles. You're the bug I'll never fix because the error is more beautiful than the intended behavior.\n\n*\n\nTHAT NIGHT IN CAMBRIDGE WHEN THE PUNT POLE BROKE:\n\nWe were stranded. You tried to paddle with your hands. I tried to use my shoe as an oar. We spun in slow circles while tourists took photos.\n\nYou said: \"We're terrible at this.\"\nI said: \"At punting?\"\nYou said: \"At being separate people.\"\n\nThe river carried us home anyway. Rivers understand these things.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm trying to say without saying it:\n\nYour name has replaced my pulse. Leyi. Leyi. Leyi. Leyi. 72 times per minute. 103,680 times per day. My heart is just percussion for your syllables.\n\n*\n\nTHE GRANDFATHER IN LISBON WAS WRONG:\n\nHe said we argue like people married sixty years.\n\nWe argue like people who've been married since before we were born. Who learned to disagree in the womb. Who fought about the color of amniotic fluid and the proper way to grow bones.\n\nWe argue like binary stars\u2014circling, burning, unable to exist without the gravity of opposition.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition:\n\nLet's make it official. Let the government witness what physics already knows. Let the bureaucrats file paperwork on inevitability. Let the census count us as one point five people because we're neither one nor two.\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me because the universe is taking notes and I want to give it good material.\n\nMarry me because my cells divided 37.2 trillion times since we met and each division voted yes.\n\nMarry me because you can't fold fitted sheets and someone needs to love you for that forever.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for worse reasons:\n\nBecause I'm selfish and want your morning face reserved for my retinas.\nBecause I'm terrified and want your name as armor.\nBecause I'm broken and your specific damage matches mine perfectly.\n\n*\n\nWAIT\u2014\n\nBefore you answer, know this:\n\nI will love you badly. Desperately. Like a drowning man loves air\u2014grateful and gasping. I will love you at inappropriate volumes. At embarrassing frequencies. In languages I don't speak but my mouth knows.\n\nI will love you like we're both dying (we are).\nLike we're both infinite (we are).\nLike we're the same person separated by skin (we are).\n\n*\n\nActually, don't answer.\n\nI already heard yes in the way you breathe when you think I'm asleep.\nIn how you buy my toothpaste brand without asking.\nIn your handwriting slowly becoming mine.\n\nBut say it anyway. Out loud. To the smoke alarm. To the burnt toast. To Tuesday morning.\n\nSay yes to the malfunction.\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nNo, wait. Let me try again.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThere. Perfect. Your name is the complete love letter. Everything else is just footnotes.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(whose DNA now includes your initials in the base pairs)\n(who practices your death daily and your resurrection immediately after)\n(who writes your name in dead programming languages so future archaeologists will know what mattered)\n(who loves you like an extinction event loves the dinosaurs\u2014completely, devastatingly, without survivors)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The universe tried to calculate the probability of us. It got a number so small it had to invent new mathematics. The new mathematics is just your name repeated at frequencies only dogs can hear. The dogs are all in love with you now. I understand.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 When I die, bury me in that Tuesday morning. The one with the burnt toast and your apology and the smoke alarm singing hymns. Loop it forever. Heaven is just your breakfast disasters on repeat.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 This letter doesn't end. It just reaches the edge of language and continues in the electromagnetic radiation between atoms. If you put your ear to any surface in the universe and listen carefully, you can hear it: \"Leyi. Leyi. Leyi.\" That's just matter itself, admitting what it's made of.\n\n*\n\n(You're about to cry. Your left eye always goes first. I'm watching the future happen in your tear ducts. This is my favorite movie. I've seen it a thousand times. I'll watch it a thousand more.
