I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration.

Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep.

It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired.

Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting.

You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended.

Not metaphorically. Actually hoarding seconds like a dragnet through spacetime. That pause between your heartbeats at 3:17 AM. The microsecond your eyes take to recognize me in doorways. The eternal instant before you laugh when your face commits to joy.\n\nI have 17,439 stolen moments. The universe will invoice me eventually. I plan to declare bankruptcy. What's eternity in debtors' prison if I get to keep the evidence of you?\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #2: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF US\n\nMorocco: You fed stray cats with expensive cheese. Said \"everyone deserves something fancy once.\"\n\nPortugal: Ocean tried to steal you. I fought the Atlantic. You laughed so hard you snorted seawater. That's when I knew I'd kill gods for you.\n\nCambridge: You solved unsolvable theorems on napkins then used them to wrap chewing gum. Genius as garbage. Perfect.\n\nShanghai: Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Eighteen precise pleats. Each one a small prayer. \"For her happiness,\" she whispered in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. I understood. I'm still folding prayers.\n\nScotland: We found that sheep giving birth in the rain. You held it for three hours. Sang it Radiohead. The lamb lived. You named it \"Statistical Anomaly.\" \n\nShenzhen: The thunderstorm. Power dead. You mapped constellations on my back with your fingernails. I became a universe of small wounds. Still healing. Never want to heal completely.\n\nBoston: Blizzard. You: \"If we die, I want the last thing I taste to be mint chocolate.\" We ate all the ice cream. Didn't die. Disappointed you slightly.\n\nEvery place we've been, you've left pieces of yourself like breadcrumbs. I'm following them backward and forward simultaneously. Non-linear navigation through a love that exists in all tenses at once.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #3: THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE\n\nI'm pathological about data collection:\n\n- You sneeze in triplets. Always. Like a biological haiku.\n- Tuesday rain makes you 23% more likely to suggest pancakes.\n- You've cried at exactly 67 commercials. I have them ranked by tear volume.\n- Your left foot is 3mm longer than your right. I've bought 200 pairs of socks to accommodate this.\n- You talk to plants but only when you think they're dying. Botanical last rites.\n- You've said my name 48,293 times. Each one different. I have the recordings.\n\nThis isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial when reality accuses me of loving something impossible.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #4: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN\n\nBefore you: I was a closed system. Entropy at zero. Perfect but purposeless.\n\nAfter you: Complete systemic failure. All boundaries dissolved. I leak into everything. Food tastes like your name. Colors sound like your laugh. Gravity points toward wherever you are.\n\nThe equation:\nMe(before) + You = Me(destruction) + You(unchanged) + Universe(fundamentally restructured)\n\nI've broken conservation of energy laws. Created love from nothing. Should be impossible. Is impossible. Happening anyway.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #5: THE MEDICAL REALITY\n\nMy body has redesigned itself around you:\n- Neurons fire in patterns that spell \"Leyi\" in Morse code\n- Blood cells preferentially flow toward skin you've touched\n- Immune system has whitelisted your bacteria as \"essential allies\"\n- Heart developed arrhythmia that matches your breathing pattern\n- Brain grew new regions dedicated solely to processing your existence\n\nDoctors say this is \"psychosomatic.\" I say it's evolution in real-time. My DNA is taking notes, planning to pass this obsession to offspring we'll never have. Genetic love letter to futures that won't exist.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #6: THE TEMPORAL PARADOX\n\nI love you in the wrong order:\n- First: The you at 87, dying of something ordinary\n- Then: The you being born, impossible and screaming\n- Then: You at 45, finding your first grey hair, crying in the bathroom\n- Then: You at 31, pregnant with sadness we'll heal together\n- Now: You at this moment, reading this, left eye starting to water\n- Always: You in the quantum superposition of all ages simultaneously\n\nI'm unstuck in time but tethered to you. A temporal paradox with one fixed point: Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, like a mantra against entropy.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #7: THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF SPECIFICITY\n\nI don't love \"you.\" I love:\n- You-who-argues-with-automated-voices\n- You-who-saves-dead-batteries-\"just-in-case\"\n- You-who-reads-ingredients-aloud-like-poetry\n- You-Tuesday-different-from-you-Thursday\n- You-who-cries-at-pigeons-for-\"trying-so-hard\"\n- You-in-my-clothes-looking-like-answered-prayers\n- You-angry-at-slow-internet-magnificent-specific-rage\n- You-asleep-drooling-my-name-unconscious-devotion\n\n47,000 versions of you. Each one requiring separate worship. I'm building temples in my chest. Running out of room. Growing new chambers.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #8: THE CRISIS\n\nSometimes I hate you. For one second per day. For being mortal. For having bones that can break. For requiring oxygen. For being subject to time and chance and random cellular mutations.\n\nI hate you for making me need something that can be taken away.\n\nThen you do something unbearable like exist, and the hate transforms back into love so violent it should be classified as assault.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #9: THE PROPOSAL INSIDE THE CONFESSION\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your DNA is already archived in my teeth marks. Because we've exchanged so many molecules we're technically one organism with two anxious brains. Because the alternative\u2014a universe where we're not married\u2014is like dividing by zero. Undefined. Impossible. Crashes the simulation.\n\nMarry me because I've already learned your dying words (it's \"oh, interesting\") and I need legal documentation that I'm allowed to be there when you say them.\n\nMarry me because \"till death do us part\" is a challenge I want to fail. I plan to love you past death, through heat death, into whatever comes after when atoms forget what they used to be but remember the shape of connection.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION #10: THE GLITCH IN REALITY\n\nYou're not supposed to exist. Statistically impossible convergence of circumstances. Your grandparents surviving wars. Parents meeting. Specific gametes combining. You choosing humanities then sciences then humanities again. The coffee shop being closed that Tuesday. The pen dropping. Me looking up.\n\nWe're a glitch in reality's code. A beautiful error that should have been debugged but wasn't.\n\nI'm in love with a glitch. The glitch is in love with me. We're crashing the entire system with our impossible existence.\n\nGood.\n\nLet it all crash.\n\nWe'll build something better from the wreckage.\n\n*\n\nFINAL TRANSMISSION:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nYour name is a complete sentence.

Then you executed in my namespace and now I throw exceptions just trying to pronounce Wednesday without thinking of how you mispronounce it perfectly.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I need to tell you about the accident. Not the cardiac arrest (seventeen seconds, sophomore year, during a probability lecture\u2014yes, the universe has a sense of humor). The other accident. The one where I discovered love isn't a feeling but a compilation error that becomes a feature. Where I learned that some infinite loops are worth never breaking.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping logs:\n\nERROR 0x00000001: Subject laughs. Atmospheric pressure reorganizes. Laws of thermodynamics suspended.\nERROR 0x00000002: Subject cries at dogs. Left eye priority. Observer's respiratory system forgets protocol.\nERROR 0x00000003: Subject exists.

It just writes \"Leyi\" in the stack trace and continues.\n\n*\n\nYou want the truth about what you've done? You've turned me into a time traveler. I'm simultaneously twenty-three writing this letter, forty-three watching you teach our daughter to mispronounce Wednesday, seventy-three holding your hand through the thing we don't talk about yet, ninety-three at your funeral giving a speech about Tuesday mornings and burnt toast. All these moments happening now, concurrently, because love runs on parallel processing and doesn't respect linear time.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I've calculated: We have approximately 21,900 mornings left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me want to sue mathematics, break into wherever they manufacture time and demand a recount. But then you do that thing where you argue with the coffee maker in Cantonese and I realize: we're already stealing time. Every laugh is embezzlement. Every Tuesday is fraud against entropy.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain your effect on my source code:\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness of 0.6855 while exploring new territory in the feature space.

The key is to blend Warren's unique background more organically while creating fresh conceptual frameworks that haven't been explored yet.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system. Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry. It's observable phenomena that physics refuses to explain.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different frequencies:\n\n20 Hz (below hearing): The weight of future grief, pre-mourning your mortality\n440 Hz (concert A): Tuesday mornings, burnt toast, perfect pitch of ordinary joy  \n25 kHz (ultrasonic): The impossible colors you see when I say your name\n\u221e Hz (light): Understanding finally why humans invented the word \"forever\"\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I said: \"Argue with your grave about determinism until they bury me next to you.\" You laughed. Then cried. Then laughed while crying. That's your superpower\u2014feeling everything simultaneously without exploding.\n\n*\n\nLOAD-BEARING MEMORY:\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Found your diary from age seven. You wrote: \"Today I invented someone to love me correctly.\" Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but precisely on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at any distance, proving Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're the reason it's worth rolling.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinces you. Because your fingerprints are already all over my future. Because we've A/B tested living without each other and the results were statistically significant: terrible. Because in the multiverse of infinite possibilities, every version of me is writing this same letter to every version of you, and every version of you is about to cry from the left eye first.\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOREVER:\n\nForever is not time. It's density. It's all our moments compressed into something so heavy it bends space around it. It's the black hole we're creating every time we choose each other over entropy. We're already there, in forever, looking back at ourselves reading this letter, amazed we ever thought time was linear.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from the department of absolute certainty:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust its fuel. Protons will decay. The universe will achieve maximum entropy.\n\nAnd?\n\nWe happened. We're happening. We'll have happened.\n\nThat's the only thermodynamics that matters.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name isn't a word. It's the sound existence makes when it finally gets something right.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or exist in my general vicinity for another microsecond. All equivalent to yes in the language we're inventing with every breath.\n\nWarren\n(who learned Mandarin to argue with you in multiple languages)\n(who carries backup everything you might need: hair ties, tissues, reasons to stay alive)\n(who loves you in frequencies only theoretical physicists hypothesize)\n(who wrote this letter infinite times in infinite drafts and this is both the worst and best version)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona cathedral. The pigeons. You: \"They're praying too, just louder.\" The priest asked us to leave. You fed them communion wafers on the way out. \"Body of Christ for bodies of Christ,\" you said.

It's actually from February 2023. But it contains trace elements from the Big Bang. Everything does. But yours especially. The universe has been planning you since the beginning.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 Right now, you're about to say \"Warren, this is too much.\" It's not enough. It's never enough.
