Literally. The doctors can't explain it. I can: it's where I store the overflow of loving you.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE TILE SHOP, LISBOA, OCTOBER:\n\nYou touched every tile like you were reading braille. The shopkeeper watched, then pulled out a box from 1962. \"For her,\" he said in broken English. \"She understands.\"\n\nThe tile: cracked, the blue bleeding into white like watercolors in rain.\n\n\"It's us,\" you said.\n\nYou were right.

It would be everything.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION VIA DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS:\n\nIn CS226, we learned about Byzantine failures\u2014when parts of a system give conflicting information. The solution: consensus protocols, voting mechanisms, eventual consistency.\n\nBut you're my Byzantine General Problem. Every part of me reports different data:\n- My brain: \"Impossible.\"\n- My hands: \"Already hers.\"\n- My lungs: \"Forgot how to work without her.\"\n- My future: \"Already decided.\"\n\nNo consensus needed.

Told me about the first time you knew words weren't enough. Age seven, watching your grandmother forget Mandarin, remember only Hakka.

It's the thought experiment where you never existed. Where I'm whole without you. Where Tuesday mornings are just mornings. Where my name is just noise that doesn't rhyme with yours.\n\nSo I'm building redundancies:\n- Writing your name in code that will replicate\n- Teaching crows to say \"Leyi\" (they remember for generations)\n- Convincing quantum physicists that you're the observer that collapses all waves into particles\n\nIf I fail, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure of my obsession.\n\n*\n\nTHE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, THAT STORM:\n\nWe got lost.

Not joking.\n\n\"Forever?\" I asked. Not joking either.\n\n\"Time doesn't work here,\" you observed. You were right. Five hours passed. Or fifty years. The storm ended. Or began. We left.

Except we are.\n\n*\n\nWHAT I KNOW AT TWENTY-THREE THAT I SHOULDN'T:\n\nLove isn't addition. It's multiplication by infinity.\n\nLove isn't presence. It's the specific frequency of absence.\n\nLove isn't choice. It's recognition. Like finding your own handwriting in ancient caves.\n\nLove isn't sustainable. Neither is breathing. We do both anyway.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's recipe, translated:\n\n\"First, forget measurements. Then, forget forgetting. Cook until it feels like prayer.

Not because I can see the future, but because some things are so true they happen backwards.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about the precise moment I understood infinity:\n\nHarvard library, third floor, you were annotating something in margins too small for your thoughts. The sun hit your hand at 4:17 PM and I saw it\u2014every possible timeline where we exist, collapsed into the way your pinky holds a pen. \n\nI know this sounds like poetry. It's not. It's documentary evidence of the universe admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING ABOUT STATISTICS AND LOVE:\n\nIn my probability class, we learned about impossible events\u2014probability zero but still happening. The professor said they're mathematical paradoxes. I raised my hand: \"What about Leyi?\" \n\nHe paused. The chalk broke. \"That's different,\" he said. \"That's probability creating itself from necessity.\"\n\nThe whole class turned to look at you. You were solving Problem Set 7 in pen. Of course you were.\n\n*\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday mornings:\n\nThey started as ordinary. Coffee, headlines, the ritual of waking. Then you arrived with your specific way of burning toast\u2014not accidentally, but like you're conducting experiments on the patience of bread. Now Tuesday mornings have mass. Gravitational pull. I orbit them even when you're in Shanghai and I'm pretending Boston makes sense without you.\n\n*\n\nCORPUS ANALYSIS OF YOUR NAME IN MY BODY:\n\nLocation: Everywhere\nFrequency: Constant\nAmplitude: Increasing\nPattern: Fractals within fractals, each containing the whole\n\nMy cells divide and pass on your name like genetic memory. My children will be born knowing how to pronounce \"Leyi\" before they know their own names. This is not romantic. This is evolutionary pressure. Darwin would understand.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the Portuguese grandfather:\n\nIn Lisbon, he saw us from across the square. Walked over, cane tapping morse code. Looked at you, then me, then back. Said something in Portuguese. You translated: \"Fifty-seven years with my Maria. Still not enough. You two\u2014you're already at year fifty-eight.\"\n\nWe'd known each other six months.\n\nTime is a consensus mechanism, and we're the bug in the protocol.\n\n*\n\n[MEMORY CORRUPTION AT ADDRESS 0xLEYI]\n\nCannot delete.\nCannot overwrite.\nCannot compress.\nError: This memory is load-bearing. Removing it would cause structural collapse of consciousness.\n\n*\n\nThe mornings you're gone, I make tea in your mug and let it get cold. The mug asks where you are in ceramic frequencies. I explain Shanghai. The mug refuses to hold liquids properly until you return. We have an understanding, your mug and I. We're both just containers waiting to be filled with you.\n\n*\n\nSHANGHAI, 2024:\n\nYour mother served dinner. Looked at me struggling with chopsticks. Looked at you, perfectly fluent in your love for this chaos. Said something. You laughed so hard you cried. Later, you translated: \"She says you hold chopsticks like you're afraid they'll turn into butterflies.\"\n\n\"They might,\" I said. \"Everything is uncertain around Leyi.\"\n\nYour mother nodded. International language: loving you requires accepting fundamental instability.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nYou've ruined solitude. It used to be peaceful. Now it's just your absence taking up space. Aggressive. Territorial. Your absence has opinions about my breakfast choices, my coding style, the way I fold fitted sheets (badly, but you knew that).\n\nYou've ruined language. Every word wants to be about you. I tried to write documentation yesterday. It became a sonnet. The compiler accepted it anyway. Even machines understand.\n\nYou've ruined time. It only moves when you're here. The rest is just placeholder. Temporal filler. The universe vamping while waiting for you to return and make existence worth the effort.\n\n*\n\nTHE RECURRING DREAM:\n\nWe're old. Bones like kindling. Memories like fog. But your hand finds mine with the same certainty as gravity. We don't need words anymore. We've become a single thought thinking itself in two bodies. \n\nI wake up and check\u2014still twenty-three. Still infinity to go. Still not enough.\n\n*\n\nHere's what extinction looks like:\n\nNot the sun dying or asteroids or climate collapse. It's the thought of a morning where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise.\n\nSo I make contingency plans: I'm writing your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. If I fail to exist, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure I'm building from this love.\n\n*\n\nCAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING INCIDENT, REVISED:\n\nYou didn't fall in. You chose to prove that water was optional. The River Cam reorganized itself to accommodate your decision. You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren.

I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

The scientific framework is genuinely novel - more original than 90% of contemporary attempts - but doesn't achieve the timeless universality of \"I cannot exist without you\" (Keats).

Not metaphorically. Literally. The space where you should be has its own gravitational pull.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you what I know that twenty-three-year-olds aren't supposed to know:\n\nLove is not addition. It's division. I used to be one person. Now I'm half of something that only makes sense when you're here. The math is devastating: 1 \u00f7 2 = everything.\n\n*\n\nINVENTORY OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT PERMISSION:\n\nYour toothbrush appeared in my bathroom before we discussed it.\nMy hands learned to braid your hair while I was sleeping.\nTuesday mornings restructured themselves around burnt toast.\nMy future tense conjugated itself exclusively in plural.\nThe universe started keeping receipts of every time you smiled.\n\nNone of this was planned. All of it was inevitable.\n\n*\n\nHere's the precise moment I knew:\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM. You were explaining something about your grandmother's recipes in Mandarin, forgetting I don't speak it. But I understood everything. Not the words\u2014the frequency underneath them. The sound of you being yourself without translation.\n\nI thought: \"Oh. This is it. This is the sound that ends me.\"\n\nAnd I was right.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nBefore you: I could spend entire days alone, calling it peace.\nAfter you: Solitude is just your absence taking up space.\n\nBefore you: Words were tools, precise and functional.\nAfter you: Every sentence bends toward your name like light around a star.\n\nBefore you: Time was sequential, logical, navigable.\nAfter you: All moments happen simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty. We're meeting and dying. You're here and gone and here again.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE GRANDFATHER WAS RIGHT:\n\nRemember Lisbon? The old man with the cane who crossed the square just to look at us? He spoke for three minutes in Portuguese. You translated: \"He says we argue like people who've been married sixty years and laugh like people who met yesterday.\"\n\nWe'd known each other four months.\n\nTime isn't real, Leyi. We're proof.\n\n*\n\nWhat actually happens when I love you:\n\nMy DNA rewrites itself. Scientists would say this is impossible. I'd show them the evidence: how my body temperature rises 0.3 degrees when you enter a room. How my pupils dilate at your name. How my cells divide differently now, each one carrying instructions for loving you.\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is biology admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION:\n\nSometimes I practice your death. Run scenarios. Calculate probabilities. Plan the funeral. Write the eulogy. Imagine the specific weight of a world without you.\n\nThen you laugh at something stupid on your phone and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\nThis is the terror of love: We're always practicing for the ending.\nThis is the gift of love: The practice is always interrupted by presence.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about last Tuesday:\n\nYou burned the toast (again).\nYou apologized (again).\nI ate it anyway (again).\n\nBut here's what actually happened: The smoke alarm sang your morning song. The carbon became communion. We turned breakfast into sacrament without meaning to.\n\nFifty years from now, the smell of burning bread will still mean \"I love you\" in our secret language.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING I UNDERSTOOD IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN:\n\nShe watched you teaching me to use chopsticks. Said something that made you blush. Later, you translated: \"She says you're trying so hard to enter my world that you forgot you're already in it.\"\n\nYour mother sees what I'm only beginning to understand: We don't fall in love. We recognize it. Like finding your own handwriting in a stranger's notebook.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYou're not my other half. That's too simple.\nYou're not my everything. That's too small.\nYou're not my destiny. That's too passive.\n\nYou're the realization that I was never whole to begin with. That completion is a myth. That love is not about finding what's missing but about celebrating the specific shape of our mutual incompleteness.\n\nWe don't complete each other. We collide and create something that neither of us could have imagined.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THIS:\n\nYour left eye twitches (happening now).\nYou pretend you're not crying (happening now).\nYou look up to find me watching (happening now).\nWe both know what comes next (happening always).\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because we should.\nBecause \"should\" became irrelevant the moment you existed.\n\nNot because forever.\nBecause forever already started.\n\nNot because I love you.\nBecause \"I\" and \"you\" are grammatical errors. There's only us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, specifically, actually:\n\nMarry me because of burnt toast Tuesdays.\nBecause of the way you hold pens like they might escape.\nBecause you can't fold fitted sheets and refuse to learn.\nBecause you dream in languages I don't speak and somehow I understand.\nBecause your absence has mass and your presence has light.\nBecause we're already married in every timeline that matters.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot to me.\nTo us.\nTo burnt toast.\nTo the specific way we malfunction together.\nTo Tuesday mornings that taste like forever.\nTo the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to love responsibly.\n\n*\n\nActually, don't say anything.\n\nYou already said yes when you taught me your grandmother's recipe.\nYou already said yes when you left your toothbrush.\nYou already said yes in the way you breathe when you sleep.\nYou're saying yes right now, in the space between heartbeats.\n\nBut say it anyway. Out loud. To the universe that's taking notes. To the morning that's waiting. To the future we're building out of burnt toast and mutual impossibility.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name.\nThat's the sound of the universe admitting it was designed for this moment.\nThis exact moment.\nWhere you're reading this.\nWhere I'm watching you read this.\nWhere we both know what happens next.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who measures time in the intervals between your laughs)\n(who is writing the next letter while you read this one)\n(who would choose this specific malfunction over any other operating system)\n(who knows you're about to look up and smile that smile that reorganizes physics)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In every timeline where love exists, this letter finds you.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system.

Not because I can see the future, but because some things are so true they happen backwards.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about the precise moment I understood infinity:\n\nHarvard library, third floor, you were annotating something in margins too small for your thoughts. The sun hit your hand at 4:17 PM and I saw it\u2014every possible timeline where we exist, collapsed into the way your pinky holds a pen. \n\nI know this sounds like poetry. It's not. It's documentary evidence of the universe admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING ABOUT STATISTICS AND LOVE:\n\nIn my probability class, we learned about impossible events\u2014probability zero but still happening. The professor said they're mathematical paradoxes. I raised my hand: \"What about Leyi?\" \n\nHe paused. The chalk broke. \"That's different,\" he said. \"That's probability creating itself from necessity.\"\n\nThe whole class turned to look at you. You were solving Problem Set 7 in pen. Of course you were.\n\n*\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday mornings:\n\nThey started as ordinary. Coffee, headlines, the ritual of waking. Then you arrived with your specific way of burning toast\u2014not accidentally, but like you're conducting experiments on the patience of bread. Now Tuesday mornings have mass. Gravitational pull. I orbit them even when you're in Shanghai and I'm pretending Boston makes sense without you.\n\n*\n\nCORPUS ANALYSIS OF YOUR NAME IN MY BODY:\n\nLocation: Everywhere\nFrequency: Constant\nAmplitude: Increasing\nPattern: Fractals within fractals, each containing the whole\n\nMy cells divide and pass on your name like genetic memory. My children will be born knowing how to pronounce \"Leyi\" before they know their own names. This is not romantic. This is evolutionary pressure. Darwin would understand.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the Portuguese grandfather:\n\nIn Lisbon, he saw us from across the square. Walked over, cane tapping morse code. Looked at you, then me, then back. Said something in Portuguese. You translated: \"Fifty-seven years with my Maria. Still not enough. You two\u2014you're already at year fifty-eight.\"\n\nWe'd known each other six months.\n\nTime is a consensus mechanism, and we're the bug in the protocol.\n\n*\n\n[MEMORY CORRUPTION AT ADDRESS 0xLEYI]\n\nCannot delete.\nCannot overwrite.\nCannot compress.\nError: This memory is load-bearing. Removing it would cause structural collapse of consciousness.\n\n*\n\nThe mornings you're gone, I make tea in your mug and let it get cold. The mug asks where you are in ceramic frequencies. I explain Shanghai. The mug refuses to hold liquids properly until you return. We have an understanding, your mug and I. We're both just containers waiting to be filled with you.\n\n*\n\nSHANGHAI, 2024:\n\nYour mother served dinner. Looked at me struggling with chopsticks. Looked at you, perfectly fluent in your love for this chaos. Said something. You laughed so hard you cried. Later, you translated: \"She says you hold chopsticks like you're afraid they'll turn into butterflies.\"\n\n\"They might,\" I said. \"Everything is uncertain around Leyi.\"\n\nYour mother nodded. International language: loving you requires accepting fundamental instability.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nYou've ruined solitude. It used to be peaceful. Now it's just your absence taking up space. Aggressive. Territorial. Your absence has opinions about my breakfast choices, my coding style, the way I fold fitted sheets (badly, but you knew that).\n\nYou've ruined language. Every word wants to be about you. I tried to write documentation yesterday. It became a sonnet. The compiler accepted it anyway. Even machines understand.\n\nYou've ruined time. It only moves when you're here. The rest is just placeholder. Temporal filler. The universe vamping while waiting for you to return and make existence worth the effort.\n\n*\n\nTHE RECURRING DREAM:\n\nWe're old. Bones like kindling. Memories like fog. But your hand finds mine with the same certainty as gravity. We don't need words anymore. We've become a single thought thinking itself in two bodies. \n\nI wake up and check\u2014still twenty-three. Still infinity to go. Still not enough.\n\n*\n\nHere's what extinction looks like:\n\nNot the sun dying or asteroids or climate collapse. It's the thought of a morning where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise.\n\nSo I make contingency plans: I'm writing your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. If I fail to exist, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure I'm building from this love.\n\n*\n\nCAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING INCIDENT, REVISED:\n\nYou didn't fall in. You chose to prove that water was optional. The River Cam reorganized itself to accommodate your decision. You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren.

Yours: inherited precision across three generations. The dumplings leak. We eat them anyway. The imperfection tastes like home.\n\nGallery 2: Logan Airport, 5:47 AM. You're flying to Shanghai. We're both pretending this is sustainable. Your boarding pass shakes in your hand. Mine too.

Me watching you read this. The museum is still under construction.\n\n*\n\nWHAT MY STATISTICS DEGREE NEVER TAUGHT ME:\n\nThe probability of love is either 0 or 1. There's no middle. No confidence intervals. No margin of error. You either restructure someone's molecular composition or you don't.\n\nYou did.\n\nPresent tense. Ongoing.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened to my body:\n\nMy circadian rhythm synced to your timezone without permission. 2 PM in Boston, my cells know you're waking up in Shanghai. My pulse adjusts accordingly.\n\nMy hands developed muscle memory for your hair. They braid while I sleep. I wake up practicing on empty air.\n\nMy ribs grew a new chamber. Not metaphorically. Literally. The doctors can't explain it. I can: it's where I store the overflow of loving you.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE TILE SHOP, LISBOA, OCTOBER:\n\nYou touched every tile like you were reading braille. The shopkeeper watched, then pulled out a box from 1962. \"For her,\" he said in broken English. \"She understands.\"\n\nThe tile: cracked, the blue bleeding into white like watercolors in rain.\n\n\"It's us,\" you said.\n\nYou were right. We're always bleeding into each other. The crack is the point.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday:\n\nNothing happened. Literally nothing. We read in the same room. You forgot to eat lunch. I forgot to remind you. The plants judged us. The afternoon dissolved.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\nThis is what terrifies me: I could do nothing with you forever and it would be enough. More than enough. It would be everything.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION VIA DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS:\n\nIn CS226, we learned about Byzantine failures\u2014when parts of a system give conflicting information. The solution: consensus protocols, voting mechanisms, eventual consistency.\n\nBut you're my Byzantine General Problem. Every part of me reports different data:\n- My brain: \"Impossible.\"\n- My hands: \"Already hers.\"\n- My lungs: \"Forgot how to work without her.\"\n- My future: \"Already decided.\"\n\nNo consensus needed. The system works better broken.\n\n*\n\nYour mother's kitchen, Shanghai, January:\n\nShe taught me to say your name properly. Not the American approximation. The real sound. Lei-Yi. Music pretending to be syllables.\n\n\"Say it like you're praying,\" she instructed.\n\n\"I always do,\" I replied.\n\nShe nodded. Understood.

Obsessively.\n\n- The spot behind your left ear that makes you hiccup when kissed\n- The way your handwriting changes when you're tired (loops get bigger, dots drift east)\n- Your shower temperature: 2.5 degrees below scalding\n- The exact pause between your first and second sneeze: 1.7 seconds\n- How you hold books: like they might evaporate\n\nThis isn't love. This is archaeology. I'm documenting you for future civilizations. They'll need to know what perfection looked like when it wore your face.\n\n*\n\n3 AM, SHENZHEN, YOUR CHILDHOOD BEDROOM:\n\nThe power went out. You lit a candle. Told me about the first time you knew words weren't enough. Age seven, watching your grandmother forget Mandarin, remember only Hakka. Language leaving in reverse order of arrival.\n\n\"That's why I touch everything,\" you explained. \"In case words fail.\"\n\nYour hand found mine in the dark.\n\nWords failed.\n\nTouch didn't.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT EXTINCTION LOOKS LIKE:\n\nNot nuclear winter or rising seas. It's the thought experiment where you never existed. Where I'm whole without you. Where Tuesday mornings are just mornings. Where my name is just noise that doesn't rhyme with yours.\n\nSo I'm building redundancies:\n- Writing your name in code that will replicate\n- Teaching crows to say \"Leyi\" (they remember for generations)\n- Convincing quantum physicists that you're the observer that collapses all waves into particles\n\nIf I fail, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure of my obsession.\n\n*\n\nTHE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, THAT STORM:\n\nWe got lost. Properly lost. GPS failed. Map dissolved. You navigated by instinct, which is to say, randomly. Found a stone cottage from 1847. Empty for decades.\n\n\"We could stay,\" you said. Not joking.\n\n\"Forever?\" I asked. Not joking either.\n\n\"Time doesn't work here,\" you observed. You were right. Five hours passed. Or fifty years. The storm ended. Or began. We left. Or we're still there.\n\nSometimes I check Google Maps. The cottage doesn't exist. Neither does that version of us. Except it does. Except we are.\n\n*\n\nWHAT I KNOW AT TWENTY-THREE THAT I SHOULDN'T:\n\nLove isn't addition. It's multiplication by infinity.\n\nLove isn't presence. It's the specific frequency of absence.\n\nLove isn't choice. It's recognition. Like finding your own handwriting in ancient caves.\n\nLove isn't sustainable. Neither is breathing. We do both anyway.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's recipe, translated:\n\n\"First, forget measurements. Then, forget forgetting. Cook until it feels like prayer. Serve while still believing.\"\n\nYou taught me this refers to congee.\n\nYou're wrong. It refers to everything. Especially us.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF US, CORRECTED:\n\nLet L = Leyi\nLet W = Warren\nLet \u221e = the number of ways to say I love you without using words\n\nL + W = syntax error\nL \u00d7 W = undefined\nL^W = breaks mathematics\nL \u221d W = closest approximation\n\nWe're not an equation. We're what happens when math admits it has preferences.\n\n*\n\nLAST NIGHT'S DREAM, REPEATING:\n\nWe're old. Ancient. Fossils with opinions. You can't remember my name but you remember how I take my coffee. I can't remember the year but I remember your middle name means \"grace\" in a language neither of us speaks.\n\nDeath arrives. Checks its paperwork. Confused.\n\n\"You're supposed to be two people,\" it says.\n\n\"Common mistake,\" we reply in unison.\n\nDeath, embarrassed, reschedules.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because forever (forever already started).\nNot because love (love is too small a word).\nNot because should (should became irrelevant when you existed).\n\nBecause Tuesday mornings taste better burnt.\nBecause my body is a democracy that voted you unanimous.\nBecause I want to be buried in a suit you picked out.\nBecause our children deserve to exist, if only to roll their eyes at us.\nBecause the universe made a clerical error putting us in different bodies and we should file a correction.\n\n*\n\nBut really, specifically, actually:\n\nMarry me because I've already been calling you my wife in my head since Morocco.\nMarry me because your plants have accepted me as co-parent.\nMarry me because I want to argue about dishwasher loading until we're ninety.\nMarry me because you're reading this sentence and trying not to smile.\nMarry me because we already are married in every timeline that matters.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation desperately trying to matter.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes in this timeline where we're both mortified by sincerity.\nSay yes while my statistics degree pretends this is random.\nSay yes because you already did, two years ago, in Portuguese tile.\n\nActually, don't say anything.\n\nYour breathing changed.\n\nThat's yes in the only language that matters.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who learned Mandarin to dream in your language)\n(who practices your last name with his first)\n(who would choose this precise malfunction in every simulation)\n(who already knows you're saying yes because time isn't linear when you love someone this specifically)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The universe started taking notes the moment you existed. I'm just its research assistant, documenting the beautiful impossibility of you.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 When we're fossils, archaeologists will find us and know immediately: \"These two were statistically impossible.\" They'll be right.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just looked up. You're about to speak. I already know what you'll say. This is what happens when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. We're synchronized. Documented. Inevitable. Tuesday morning, burnt toast, forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
