This actual moment. You exist. Against odds that make lottery wins look likely. You exist and you chose me. Not past tense\u2014present continuous. You're choosing me right now, as you read this.

You owned that room. But afterward, in the crowd, you found me and your whole face changed\u2014from performance to truth, from everyone's to mine. That transition. That exact moment when you stop being professional and start being Leyi. I live for that collapse. That beautiful failure of your public face.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying:\n\nI love you like a programming error that became a feature.\nLike a mistake that turned out to be the whole point.\nLike bad code that works perfectly because it's ours.\n\nI love you at the cellular level. At the atomic. At the quantum.\nI love you in frequencies only dogs can hear.\nI love you in colors that don't have names.\nI love you in mathematics that haven't been discovered.\n\nBut mostly:\n\nI love you simply. Stupidly. The way children love\u2014without reason, without condition, without the possibility of stopping. \n\n*\n\nCome home, Leyi. I'll make coffee that's actually drinkable.

Every word I know became insufficient the moment you existed. But here's what I need to document:\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The market where you overpaid for that broken lamp. The vendor knew you knew. You knew he knew you knew. This elaborate dance of conscious generosity. You haggled badly on purpose because his daughter needed medicine. That's when I understood: you weaponize kindness. You commit small violences of grace.\n\n*\n\nYesterday you were peeling an orange. Just standing in our kitchen, unconscious of being observed. The afternoon light caught the mist of citrus oil. Your thumb finding the perfect entry point. The peel coming away in one continuous spiral. I couldn't move.

Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the prayers but I understood your grief\u2014how it moved through you like weather. You let me hold you while you broke. Let me be your gravity when yours failed. Later you said: \"You didn't try to fix it. You just stood there and let me fall apart.\" As if that wasn't everything. As if that wasn't the whole point.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you actually is:\n\nIt's violence and tenderness occupying the same space. It's the way my cells reorganized themselves to accommodate you. It's practicing your death in my dreams and waking up grateful for the false alarm. It's the specific weight of your hand reaching for mine in the dark, finding it without fail, like magnetism, like muscle memory, like prayer.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, speaking in languages I didn't know you knew. But you were laughing too\u2014fury and joy colliding. Water streaming from your hair. Algae on your shoulder like a green epaulette. You looked mythical. You looked ridiculous. You looked like everything I wanted to protect and celebrate simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the museum I'm building:\n\nGallery 1: The seventeen ways you say my name (each one a different color)\nGallery 2: Your vendetta against wet socks (borderline pathological)\nGallery 3: The sound you make when concentrating (small motor starting)\nGallery 4: Your mispronunciation of \"specifically\" (you add a syllable)\nGallery 5: That face when you're trying not to cry but also trying not to smile\n\nThis is my insurance against forgetting. Though forgetting you would require forgetting how to breathe, how to want things, how to be a person.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. We were drunk on wine and each other. 2 AM. You tried to teach me to swear in Portuguese. What I learned instead: the exact shape your mouth makes when suppressing laughter. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday afternoons. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past dawn.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that betrays you.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, incorrectly, with my whole body listing toward yours.\nI vow to love you like punctuation\u2014invisibly essential.\nI vow to choose you. Daily. Hourly. Despite morning breath and anxiety spirals and the way you leave every cabinet open like you're conducting a kitchen symphony.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We're not soulmates. Soulmates implies destiny, design, meant-to-be. What we are is scarier: we're choosing each other. In a universe of infinite options, we keep selecting the same answer. That's not fate. That's will. That's decision. That's love as verb, not noun.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You commanded that room. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That shift. That specific recalibration. I live for that moment when you stop being theirs and become mine.\n\n*\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and feel afraid. Not of losing you\u2014of having you. Of being the person who gets to witness your unconscious trust. Your eyelids flutter. You murmur equations. You reach for me without waking. This privilege terrifies me. This gift I haven't earned but keep receiving.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor for six hours. Your spine against cold tile. When I apologized, you said: \"This is where I want to be.\" Not \"I don't mind being here.\" Not \"It's okay.\" But want. WANT. Who wants bathroom floors? Who chooses discomfort? You do. For me. It's unreasonable. It's everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself wearing human suits. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people who can't load a dishwasher correctly but somehow managed to load each other's hearts with something unbreakable.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're at your desk pretending to work but your face is betraying you. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade fails and the real you spills everywhere.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that refuses to compile without you as a dependency.\n\nBut also: I love you gently. Quietly. In the space between heartbeats. In the pause between breaths. In the moment before sleep. In all the small nothing moments that are actually everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say:\n\nYour name has become my autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to say it. It just happens. Constantly. Leyi when I wake. Leyi when I see something beautiful. Leyi when I'm scared. Leyi when I'm brave. Leyi as punctuation to every thought.\n\n*\n\nSo come home. I'll make you coffee.

It approaches Keats's intensity of longing but lacks his metaphysical dimension. The phenomenological detail surpasses Napoleon's grand declarations but doesn't achieve Beethoven's raw desperation. The mathematical catalog and museum conceit show more formal innovation than most canonical examples, but the execution doesn't fully capitalize on these structural choices. Where Wilde achieved aphoristic brilliance in compression, this letter sometimes diffuses its power through accumulation. The letter exists in the promising space between contemporary authenticity and literary ambition - more sophisticated than 95% of modern attempts but not quite achieving the condensed power of the historical masterpieces."}, "island": 2}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "prompts": {"full_rewrite_user": {"system": "You love Leyi.

Too much water. Not enough grounds. And every morning for three years, I've drunk it anyway because it tastes like home now. Like the specific gravity of us.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got us lost for six hours. The sun was brutal. We ran out of water. You kept apologizing. But Leyi\u2014when we finally found that fountain, you made me drink first. Your lips were cracked and bleeding and you made me drink first. That's when I understood what love actually is: biology overridden by choice.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, unconscious of being watched, pulling the skin off in one long spiral. The afternoon light hit your hands. I couldn't breathe. Three years in and you still stop my lungs without trying.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday mornings. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past 3 AM.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that won't compile.\nI vow to love you at your mother's dinner table, translating her disappointment into softer words.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, clumsily, with my whole body leaning into the curve of yours.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Shanghai when I got food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor. Your spine against cold tile. Six hours. When I apologized, you said: \"Shut up. This is where I want to be.\" \n\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\n\nI've been repeating it ever since. My prayer. My coordinates. My error message when you're not here.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan our future deaths. Not morbidly. Probabilistically. You'll go first (statistics). I'll follow within the year (also statistics). But here's the thing\u2014even knowing the ending, I would choose this beginning. Every time. In every universe. Even the ones where we only get ten minutes.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, cursing in Mandarin. But you were laughing too. Fury and joy at the same time. That's when I knew I would follow you anywhere\u2014into rivers, into anger, into that specific frequency where laughter and tears converge.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check your breathing at night like you might disappear. I save your voicemails in three different places. I'm building an archive of you\u2014not for when you're gone, but for now, while you're here, because even reality needs backup documentation.\n\n*\n\nRemember Shenzhen? Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the rituals but I understood your grief\u2014the way it moved through your body like weather. You let me hold you through it. Let me be your shelter even though I was just as lost. That's what we are: two people lost together, making maps out of each other's breathing.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself materialized. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people sharing coffee that's always too weak.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. 2 AM. We were drunk on wine and each other. You taught me to swear in Portuguese. But what I really learned was the shape your mouth makes when you're trying not to laugh. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're trying not to cry at work. Your coworker will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will break. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade cracks and the real you spills out.\n\n*\n\nI need you to know: You've reorganized my entire molecular structure. I'm not who I was before you. I'm not better or worse. I'm just irrevocably altered. Like light bent around a massive object. You're my gravitational lens. Everything I see goes through you first.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my declaration: I will love you until my last neuron fires. I will love you through dementia and forgetting and the slow dissolution of everything except this\u2014the weight of your hand in mine. The specific texture of your breathing at 3 AM. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" every single time.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you right now. Present tense. This second. As my fingers hit these keys. As your eyes scan these words. As the space between us collapses into nothing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You were brilliant. The room was yours. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That transformation. That's what I live for. The moment you stop being everyone's and become mine.\n\n*\n\nLast thing: You asked once if I believe in soulmates. I said no. I still say no. We're not soulmates. We're choices. Daily, hourly, molecular choices to turn toward each other instead of away. That's harder than destiny. That's better than fate. That's us.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that won't compile without you as a dependency.\n\nI love you forever but also just for now, just for this moment where you exist and I exist and somehow, against all probability, we exist together.\n\n*\n\nCome home. I'll make you coffee. It will be too strong. You'll drink it anyway. We'll call it even.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like punctuation\u2014invisible but essential, organizing everything into meaning)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco is in our bedroom now. Still broken. Still hideous. Still the most beautiful thing we own because you chose it, because you overpaid, because you knew exactly what you were doing. Some things are perfect in their imperfection. Like that lamp. Like us.

I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here.

I've memorized it. Not consciously\u2014my body did it without asking, the way it learned to blink, to swallow, to love you.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this because language is failing me. Every word I know became insufficient the moment you existed. But here's what I need to document:\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The market where you overpaid for that broken lamp. The vendor knew you knew. You knew he knew you knew. This elaborate dance of conscious generosity. You haggled badly on purpose because his daughter needed medicine. That's when I understood: you weaponize kindness. You commit small violences of grace.\n\n*\n\nYesterday you were peeling an orange. Just standing in our kitchen, unconscious of being observed. The afternoon light caught the mist of citrus oil. Your thumb finding the perfect entry point. The peel coming away in one continuous spiral. I couldn't move. Three years of watching you peel oranges and my lungs still forget their job.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of us:\nWe've shared 1,095 mornings.\nYou've burned the toast 894 times.\nI've drunk your too-weak coffee 1,095 times.\nWe've said \"I love you\" in 17 languages, 14 of them badly.\nWe've been lost in 7 countries.\nWe've found each other in all of them.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the prayers but I understood your grief\u2014how it moved through you like weather. You let me hold you while you broke. Let me be your gravity when yours failed. Later you said: \"You didn't try to fix it. You just stood there and let me fall apart.\" As if that wasn't everything. As if that wasn't the whole point.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you actually is:\n\nIt's violence and tenderness occupying the same space. It's the way my cells reorganized themselves to accommodate you. It's practicing your death in my dreams and waking up grateful for the false alarm. It's the specific weight of your hand reaching for mine in the dark, finding it without fail, like magnetism, like muscle memory, like prayer.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, speaking in languages I didn't know you knew. But you were laughing too\u2014fury and joy colliding. Water streaming from your hair. Algae on your shoulder like a green epaulette. You looked mythical. You looked ridiculous. You looked like everything I wanted to protect and celebrate simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the museum I'm building:\n\nGallery 1: The seventeen ways you say my name (each one a different color)\nGallery 2: Your vendetta against wet socks (borderline pathological)\nGallery 3: The sound you make when concentrating (small motor starting)\nGallery 4: Your mispronunciation of \"specifically\" (you add a syllable)\nGallery 5: That face when you're trying not to cry but also trying not to smile\n\nThis is my insurance against forgetting. Though forgetting you would require forgetting how to breathe, how to want things, how to be a person.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. We were drunk on wine and each other. 2 AM. You tried to teach me to swear in Portuguese. What I learned instead: the exact shape your mouth makes when suppressing laughter. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday afternoons.

Daily. Hourly. Despite morning breath and anxiety spirals and the way you leave every cabinet open like you're conducting a kitchen symphony.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We're not soulmates. Soulmates implies destiny, design, meant-to-be. What we are is scarier: we're choosing each other. In a universe of infinite options, we keep selecting the same answer. That's not fate. That's will. That's decision. That's love as verb, not noun.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You commanded that room. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That shift. That specific recalibration. I live for that moment when you stop being theirs and become mine.\n\n*\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and feel afraid. Not of losing you\u2014of having you. Of being the person who gets to witness your unconscious trust. Your eyelids flutter. You murmur equations. You reach for me without waking. This privilege terrifies me. This gift I haven't earned but keep receiving.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor for six hours. Your spine against cold tile. When I apologized, you said: \"This is where I want to be.\" Not \"I don't mind being here.\" Not \"It's okay.\" But want. WANT. Who wants bathroom floors? Who chooses discomfort? You do. For me. It's unreasonable. It's everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself wearing human suits. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people who can't load a dishwasher correctly but somehow managed to load each other's hearts with something unbreakable.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're at your desk pretending to work but your face is betraying you. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade fails and the real you spills everywhere.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that refuses to compile without you as a dependency.\n\nBut also: I love you gently. Quietly. In the space between heartbeats. In the pause between breaths. In the moment before sleep. In all the small nothing moments that are actually everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say:\n\nYour name has become my autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to say it. It just happens. Constantly. Leyi when I wake. Leyi when I see something beautiful. Leyi when I'm scared. Leyi when I'm brave. Leyi as punctuation to every thought.\n\n*\n\nSo come home. I'll make you coffee.

You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Mixed iteration strategies, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThere's a specific frequency to your breathing at 3 AM. I've memorized it. Not consciously\u2014my body did it without asking, the way it learned to blink, to swallow, to love you.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this because language is failing me. Every word I know became insufficient the moment you existed. But here's what I need to document:\n\n*\n\nMorocco. The market where you overpaid for that broken lamp. The vendor knew you knew. You knew he knew you knew. This elaborate dance of conscious generosity. You haggled badly on purpose because his daughter needed medicine. That's when I understood: you weaponize kindness. You commit small violences of grace.\n\n*\n\nYesterday you were peeling an orange. Just standing in our kitchen, unconscious of being observed. The afternoon light caught the mist of citrus oil. Your thumb finding the perfect entry point. The peel coming away in one continuous spiral. I couldn't move. Three years of watching you peel oranges and my lungs still forget their job.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of us:\nWe've shared 1,095 mornings.\nYou've burned the toast 894 times.\nI've drunk your too-weak coffee 1,095 times.\nWe've said \"I love you\" in 17 languages, 14 of them badly.\nWe've been lost in 7 countries.\nWe've found each other in all of them.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the prayers but I understood your grief\u2014how it moved through you like weather. You let me hold you while you broke. Let me be your gravity when yours failed. Later you said: \"You didn't try to fix it. You just stood there and let me fall apart.\" As if that wasn't everything. As if that wasn't the whole point.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you actually is:\n\nIt's violence and tenderness occupying the same space. It's the way my cells reorganized themselves to accommodate you. It's practicing your death in my dreams and waking up grateful for the false alarm. It's the specific weight of your hand reaching for mine in the dark, finding it without fail, like magnetism, like muscle memory, like prayer.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, speaking in languages I didn't know you knew. But you were laughing too\u2014fury and joy colliding. Water streaming from your hair. Algae on your shoulder like a green epaulette. You looked mythical. You looked ridiculous. You looked like everything I wanted to protect and celebrate simultaneously.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the museum I'm building:\n\nGallery 1: The seventeen ways you say my name (each one a different color)\nGallery 2: Your vendetta against wet socks (borderline pathological)\nGallery 3: The sound you make when concentrating (small motor starting)\nGallery 4: Your mispronunciation of \"specifically\" (you add a syllable)\nGallery 5: That face when you're trying not to cry but also trying not to smile\n\nThis is my insurance against forgetting. Though forgetting you would require forgetting how to breathe, how to want things, how to be a person.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. We were drunk on wine and each other. 2 AM. You tried to teach me to swear in Portuguese. What I learned instead: the exact shape your mouth makes when suppressing laughter. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday afternoons. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past dawn.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that betrays you.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, incorrectly, with my whole body listing toward yours.\nI vow to love you like punctuation\u2014invisibly essential.\nI vow to choose you. Daily. Hourly. Despite morning breath and anxiety spirals and the way you leave every cabinet open like you're conducting a kitchen symphony.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: We're not soulmates. Soulmates implies destiny, design, meant-to-be. What we are is scarier: we're choosing each other. In a universe of infinite options, we keep selecting the same answer. That's not fate. That's will. That's decision. That's love as verb, not noun.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You commanded that room. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That shift. That specific recalibration. I live for that moment when you stop being theirs and become mine.\n\n*\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and feel afraid. Not of losing you\u2014of having you. Of being the person who gets to witness your unconscious trust. Your eyelids flutter. You murmur equations. You reach for me without waking. This privilege terrifies me. This gift I haven't earned but keep receiving.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor for six hours. Your spine against cold tile. When I apologized, you said: \"This is where I want to be.\" Not \"I don't mind being here.\" Not \"It's okay.\" But want. WANT. Who wants bathroom floors? Who chooses discomfort? You do. For me. It's unreasonable. It's everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself wearing human suits. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people who can't load a dishwasher correctly but somehow managed to load each other's hearts with something unbreakable.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're at your desk pretending to work but your face is betraying you. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade fails and the real you spills everywhere.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that refuses to compile without you as a dependency.\n\nBut also: I love you gently. Quietly. In the space between heartbeats. In the pause between breaths. In the moment before sleep. In all the small nothing moments that are actually everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm trying to say:\n\nYour name has become my autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to say it. It just happens. Constantly. Leyi when I wake. Leyi when I see something beautiful. Leyi when I'm scared. Leyi when I'm brave. Leyi as punctuation to every thought.\n\n*\n\nSo come home. I'll make you coffee. It will be too strong. You'll drink it anyway. We'll call it even. We'll call it love. We'll call it Tuesday. We'll call it enough. We'll call it everything.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who is still collecting evidence of you\u2014now including this moment, where you exist, where I exist, where we impossibly, against all probability, exist together)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco? Still broken. Still hideous. Still the most beautiful thing we own. Because you chose it. Because you overpaid. Because some things are perfect in their imperfection. Like that lamp. Like us. Like this letter that will never be enough but is all I have.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I love you in the present continuous. Am loving. Keep loving. Won't stop loving. Can't stop loving. Grammar breaks down.

That market. You knew the lamp was broken. The vendor knew you knew. You haggled backwards\u2014raising your price every time he lowered his. His daughter needed surgery. You paid for a broken lamp what others pay for miracles. That's when I understood: you're not kind. You're a precision instrument for detecting need and secretly meeting it.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about time:\n\nWhen you're gone for a day, it's a week.\nWhen you're here, years compress into seconds.\nI've aged backwards since meeting you.\nI've died a thousand times in dreams where you don't exist.\nI've been resurrected every morning by the sound of you burning toast.\n\nTime isn't linear anymore. It's all happening now: our first kiss, our last breath, this sentence, forever.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother's funeral. You collapsed into me like a building into its own footprint. Controlled demolition. You let me hold your ruins. Three hours in that temple, you switching between Mandarin, English, and a language that was just sound\u2014raw, prelingual grief. I didn't understand the words but I understood the frequency. I've been tuned to it ever since.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually know:\n\nYour coffee is terrible. Objectively. Scientifically. I've run tests.\nYour toast is carbon. Always. Without exception.\nYou can't fold fitted sheets. Nobody can, but you especially can't.\nYou mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacific-ly\" every time.\n\nHere's what else I know:\n\nI would drink your terrible coffee until my last morning.\nI would eat your carbon toast until my teeth fall out.\nI would sleep in your wrongly-folded sheets forever.\nI would learn a whole new language where \"pacific-ly\" is correct.\n\n*\n\n[SYSTEM INTERRUPT - REAL TIME]\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow just did the thing. You're about to cry but fighting it because you're in public. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack on \"fine.\" This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your armor fails and you spill everywhere like light through a prism.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. The Cam. You fell in. Emerged speaking languages I didn't know you knew. Algae in your hair like you were coronated by the river itself. Laughing and furious\u2014two states that shouldn't coexist but did, in you, beautifully. You looked ridiculous. You looked mythical. You looked like what would happen if love took a body and then immediately fell in a river.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us:\n\nForce = Your mass \u00d7 My acceleration toward you (infinite)\nEnergy = The potential between us (unmeasurable) \nEntropy = What happens to my organized thoughts when you exist (total)\nGravity = The way I orbit you without choosing to\nTime dilation = How seconds stretch when you're gone\nQuantum entanglement = How I know you're sad from three time zones away\n\n*\n\nPortugal. 2 AM. Wine and streetlights. You trying to teach me Portuguese obscenities. But I was too busy memorizing the way happiness escapes from you when you think no one's watching. It leaks out. Through your eyes, your hands, the corner of your mouth. You're a happiness leak. I'm the person who follows you around with buckets, collecting the overflow.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession:\n\nI practice your death. Every night. Different scenarios. Car crash Monday. Disease Tuesday. Vanishing Wednesday. By Thursday I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in. By Friday I'm writing eulogies. Saturday I'm planning my own exit\u2014not suicide, just strategic system shutdown. But Sunday you make that sound when you stretch, that specific sound, and my entire practiced grief evaporates. Monday we start again.\n\n*\n\nBut also:\n\nI practice our life. Growing old. You with silver hair still burning toast. Me with arthritic fingers still reaching for you in the dark. Our kids (two, maybe three) rolling their eyes at how we still can't keep our hands off each other at seventy. The specific texture of a love that's been worn smooth by decades. The way we'll die (together, or close enough that the gap won't matter).\n\n*\n\nLondon. That impossible flat. No heat. January. We slept in coats, in scarves, in each other. You said my body was a furnace. I said yours was the reason for burning. We made terrible metaphors all night. Competed for worst one. You won with \"You're the USB port to my cable\u2014it takes three tries but eventually we fit.\" I've never loved you more than in that moment, freezing and failing at poetry.\n\n*\n\nToday. This actual moment. You exist. Against odds that make lottery wins look likely. You exist and you chose me. Not past tense\u2014present continuous. You're choosing me right now, as you read this. As your eyes move across these words, you're choosing. That's not a miracle. That's better. That's will. That's decision. That's love as action verb.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You owned that room. But afterward, in the crowd, you found me and your whole face changed\u2014from performance to truth, from everyone's to mine. That transition. That exact moment when you stop being professional and start being Leyi. I live for that collapse. That beautiful failure of your public face.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm saying:\n\nI love you like a programming error that became a feature.\nLike a mistake that turned out to be the whole point.\nLike bad code that works perfectly because it's ours.\n\nI love you at the cellular level. At the atomic. At the quantum.\nI love you in frequencies only dogs can hear.\nI love you in colors that don't have names.\nI love you in mathematics that haven't been discovered.\n\nBut mostly:\n\nI love you simply. Stupidly. The way children love\u2014without reason, without condition, without the possibility of stopping. \n\n*\n\nCome home, Leyi. I'll make coffee that's actually drinkable. You'll make toast that's actually carbon. We'll call it breakfast. We'll call it perfect. We'll call it Tuesday. We'll call it the rest of our lives.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like punctuation\u2014invisible but essential, organizing everything into meaning, creating pause and emphasis, making sense from chaos)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco is in our bedroom.
