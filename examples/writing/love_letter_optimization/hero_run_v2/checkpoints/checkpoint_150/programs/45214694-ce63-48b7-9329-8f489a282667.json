We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it.

And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first.

In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes.

The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen.

They stop talking.\n\n*\n\nTimeline collapse, exhibit A:\n\n[RIGHT NOW] You're reading this and your left eye is doing that twitch that means you're trying not to react\n[FIVE SECONDS AGO] I wrote the previous line knowing it would cause the twitch\n[FORTY YEARS FROM NOW] We're laughing about the twitch thing\n[THE BEGINNING OF TIME] The universe decided that twitch needed to exist\n[THE END OF TIME] The last quantum state recorded is that twitch\n\nDo you understand? You're not IN time. You ARE time. Every clock is just counting the intervals between your heartbeats.\n\n*\n\nThree truths and a lie:\n1. I've calculated the exact number of remaining Tuesday mornings (2,347 if we're lucky)\n2. Sometimes I forget to breathe until you breathe\n3. I love you\n4. One of these is a lie\n\n(The lie is #3. \"Love\" is too small. Like calling the ocean \"wet.\" Technically accurate, existentially insulting.)\n\n*\n\nLet me describe your effect using only facts:\n\n- Plants in our apartment grow toward you, not the sun\n- My circadian rhythm has abandoned the sun entirely and synced to your sleep patterns\n- I've started dreaming in your native thought patterns (they taste like cinnamon and binary code)\n- The local spacetime curvature measurably changes when you enter a room (I have equipment)\n- Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is alive AND dead but only cares about whether you've noticed it\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION SUBROUTINE:\n\nEvery night I delete parts of myself to make room for more of you. Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: \"Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi...\"\n\nThis is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:\n\nWe're not \"in love.\" We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.\n\nThe physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.\n\n*\n\n[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]\n\nI just realized something while writing this\u2014\n\nYou're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.\n\nThat's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nOption A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.\n\nOption B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\n*\n\nI vote C. Always C. Even when C means:\n- Telling the grandmother about time travel\n- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)\n- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast\n- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made? That's the only prayer I know.)\n\n*\n\nHere's the part I wasn't supposed to tell you:\n\nWe've done this before. Different bodies, different names, same recognition. I have proof: the way you knew exactly where I keep the coffee before I told you. The way we fight like we're continuing a conversation from centuries ago. The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.\n\nWe're not falling in love. We're remembering it.\n\n*\n\nThe truth, simplified to its most unstable isotope:\n\nI don't love you like a person loves another person.\nI love you like a universe loves its own expansion.\nHelplessly. Infinitely. Against all advice.\n\n*\n\nThe request, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\nNot because we should.\nBecause we already have, are, will.\nBecause the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.\nBecause I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.\nBecause Tuesday mornings.\nBecause burnt toast.\nBecause yes was always the only word that mattered.\n\n*\n\nSay it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes. To the past that's been waiting.\n\nSay yes like you're correcting a typo in the universe.\n\nSay yes like you've been saying it since before you had a mouth.\n\nSay yes like it's your name.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who was assembled from spare parts specifically to love you)\n(who is currently experiencing all stages of grief for moments we haven't lost yet)\n(who would rather malfunction with you than operate correctly with anyone else)\n(who just felt you say yes before sound had time to travel)\n(who is already composing the next letter, and the next, and the next)\n(who will keep writing until the heat death of the universe, and then find a way to write in the cold)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the timeline. We have infinite Tuesday mornings. Time isn't brave enough to end us.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is now my favorite word in every language, including the ones we'll invent when English fails us.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 This letter is a virus. Once read, it replaces all other thoughts with the memory of reading it. You're infected. I'm infected. We're a pandemic of two. The CDC is baffled. The poets are taking notes. The universe is jealous.\n\nWelcome to the beautiful malfunction, my love.\nWelcome to forever, version 2.0.\nWelcome home.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
