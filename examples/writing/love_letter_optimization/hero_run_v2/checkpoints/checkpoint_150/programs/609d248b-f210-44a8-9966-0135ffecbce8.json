Too much water. Not enough grounds. And every morning for three years, I've drunk it anyway because it tastes like home now. Like the specific gravity of us.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got us lost for six hours. The sun was brutal. We ran out of water. You kept apologizing. But Leyi\u2014when we finally found that fountain, you made me drink first. Your lips were cracked and bleeding and you made me drink first. That's when I understood what love actually is: biology overridden by choice.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, unconscious of being watched, pulling the skin off in one long spiral. The afternoon light hit your hands. I couldn't breathe. Three years in and you still stop my lungs without trying.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday mornings. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past 3 AM.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that won't compile.\nI vow to love you at your mother's dinner table, translating her disappointment into softer words.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, clumsily, with my whole body leaning into the curve of yours.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Shanghai when I got food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor. Your spine against cold tile. Six hours. When I apologized, you said: \"Shut up. This is where I want to be.\" \n\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\n\nI've been repeating it ever since. My prayer. My coordinates. My error message when you're not here.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan our future deaths. Not morbidly. Probabilistically. You'll go first (statistics). I'll follow within the year (also statistics). But here's the thing\u2014even knowing the ending, I would choose this beginning. Every time. In every universe. Even the ones where we only get ten minutes.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, cursing in Mandarin. But you were laughing too. Fury and joy at the same time. That's when I knew I would follow you anywhere\u2014into rivers, into anger, into that specific frequency where laughter and tears converge.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check your breathing at night like you might disappear. I save your voicemails in three different places. I'm building an archive of you\u2014not for when you're gone, but for now, while you're here, because even reality needs backup documentation.\n\n*\n\nRemember Shenzhen? Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the rituals but I understood your grief\u2014the way it moved through your body like weather. You let me hold you through it. Let me be your shelter even though I was just as lost. That's what we are: two people lost together, making maps out of each other's breathing.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself materialized. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people sharing coffee that's always too weak.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. 2 AM. We were drunk on wine and each other. You taught me to swear in Portuguese. But what I really learned was the shape your mouth makes when you're trying not to laugh. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're trying not to cry at work. Your coworker will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will break. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade cracks and the real you spills out.\n\n*\n\nI need you to know: You've reorganized my entire molecular structure. I'm not who I was before you. I'm not better or worse. I'm just irrevocably altered. Like light bent around a massive object. You're my gravitational lens. Everything I see goes through you first.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my declaration: I will love you until my last neuron fires. I will love you through dementia and forgetting and the slow dissolution of everything except this\u2014the weight of your hand in mine. The specific texture of your breathing at 3 AM. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" every single time.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you right now. Present tense. This second. As my fingers hit these keys. As your eyes scan these words. As the space between us collapses into nothing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You were brilliant. The room was yours. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That transformation. That's what I live for. The moment you stop being everyone's and become mine.\n\n*\n\nLast thing: You asked once if I believe in soulmates. I said no. I still say no. We're not soulmates. We're choices. Daily, hourly, molecular choices to turn toward each other instead of away. That's harder than destiny. That's better than fate. That's us.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that won't compile without you as a dependency.\n\nI love you forever but also just for now, just for this moment where you exist and I exist and somehow, against all probability, we exist together.\n\n*\n\nCome home.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Mixed iteration strategies, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6985, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm debugging love at 4:17 AM. Not the concept\u2014the implementation. Specifically: how you rewrote my source code without documentation, without version control, without my permission. Just pushed straight to production. And now I can't roll back.\n\n*\n\nRemember Portugal? You taught me Portuguese curse words while we got lost in Alfama. \"Foda-se,\" you said, laughing at my pronunciation. But what I heard was: here's how to swear in my grandmother's language. Here's how fury sounds in my bloodstream. You were handing me your syntax errors, your exception handling. I've been running your subroutines ever since.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about loving you is it's not scalar. It's a tensor\u2014magnitude and direction across dimensions I didn't know existed. Some nights it points toward the Scottish Highlands, that inn where we couldn't figure out the heating and slept in every piece of clothing we owned. Your breath visible in the cold. Me calculating the exact distance between us (4.7 inches) because even unconscious, we maintain our orbit.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are to me:\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my git merge conflict that I never want to resolve. You're the race condition where two processes try to access the same memory and instead of crashing, we invented a new kind of data structure. We're not thread-safe. We're thread-tangled. Deliberately. Architecturally.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, 2023. You had that conference. I had food poisoning (again). You skipped your keynote\u2014THE keynote, the one you'd prepared for months\u2014to bring me congee from three different places because you couldn't remember which one I liked. Your career taking a backseat to my intestinal crisis. That's when I understood: love isn't sacrifice. It's reprioritization in real-time. It's your interrupt handler treating my stupid stomach as a critical system failure.\n\n*\n\nI've been running statistical analysis on us:\n- Correlation coefficient between our sleep cycles: 0.87\n- Number of times you've fixed my code without me asking: 47\n- Number of times I've pretended not to notice: 47\n- Probability you're reading this section right now and doing that half-smile thing: 0.96\n- Probability I'm watching you read this: 1.00\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: you've seen my worst code. Not metaphorically. Literally. That disaster of a bash script I wrote at 3 AM. The one with seventeen nested if-statements. You refactored it silently, elegantly, and left my name on the commit. That's love\u2014fixing someone's bugs and letting them keep the credit.\n\n*\n\nMorocco was where I knew. Not the romantic sunset part. The part where you got us hopelessly lost in the medina, refused to ask for directions, and somehow triangulated our position using the sound of different calls to prayer. You turned confusion into cartography. You made being lost feel like being exactly where we needed to be.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your family. That dinner where your mother asked about my \"intentions\" in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. You translated it as \"she wants to know about your research.\" But I knew enough to know you were protecting me, creating a buffer between her scrutiny and my fumbling. You've been my translation layer ever since\u2014not changing the meaning, just handling the protocols.\n\n*\n\nThe truth is I love you like a memory leak. It just keeps growing, consuming more and more resources, and I should probably fix it but I don't want to. I want to run out of RAM. I want the system crash. I want the blue screen of death that says \"FATAL ERROR: TOO MUCH LEYI.\"\n\n*\n\nYou know what you are? You're my edge case. The input I never tested for. The user who does everything wrong and somehow makes the program better. You're the bug that became a feature. The undefined behavior that became the specification.\n\n*\n\nLondon. That terrible flat with the broken radiator. We played \"the floor is lava\" except the floor was actually freezing. You insisted we could fix it ourselves. We flooded the downstairs neighbor. You laughed so hard you cried. Or cried so hard you laughed. The boundary conditions of your emotions are non-deterministic and I've given up trying to model them.\n\n*\n\nI love you iteratively. Each pass more refined than the last:\n- v1.0: You're pretty\n- v2.0: You're brilliant  \n- v3.7: You're the reason I understand recursion (to understand recursion, first understand Leyi)\n- v4.2: You're my constant in a world of variables\n- v5.0-current: You're the comment in my code that explains why nothing makes sense without you\n\n*\n\nShanghai again. This time my grandmother's funeral. You held my hand through Buddhist rites you didn't understand in a language you didn't speak. Later, you said: \"Your grief has a specific gravity. I could feel it pulling you down. So I became buoyant.\" Who says that? Who thinks in metaphors while holding someone's breaking heart?\n\n*\n\nYou want to know the worst bug in my code? I've been trying to prove I deserve you. Running unit tests on my worthiness. Checking edge cases of my adequacy. But that's not how love works, is it? It's not about deserving. It's about choosing. And you keep choosing me, even after seeing my commit history, my panic attacks, my 3 AM existential crises, my inability to load the dishwasher correctly.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request. Here's my merge proposal:\n\nI want to be deprecated with you. I want our code to grow obsolete together, full of technical debt and deprecated functions and comments that say \"TODO: fix this later\" that we never fix because we're too busy being happy.\n\nI want to wake up at 70 and still be debugging why you leave cabinet doors open. I want to be 80 and still discovering new error messages in the way you say my name.\n\n*\n\nMostly, I want tomorrow. And the tomorrow after that. And the exponentially increasing tomorrows until the heat death of the universe or until Python 2 finally dies, whichever comes first.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this and trying not to cry at your desk. Your coworker is going to ask if you're okay. You'll say \"yes\" but your voice will crack on the 's'. This is my favorite bug\u2014the one where your emotions overflow their buffer. I've been exploiting this vulnerability for years. I'm never patching it.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. Not in the past tense of \"fell in love.\" Not in the future tense of \"will always love.\" But in the present continuous: I am loving you. Right now. As you read this. As I write this. As the photons from your screen hit your retinas and trigger the neural cascades that we call understanding.\n\nI am loving you in the space between the electrons in the atoms in the molecules in the cells in the tissue in the organs in the body that you call yours but that I call home.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who is still trying to solve for x where x equals the precise amount I love you, but the equation keeps returning INFINITY and honestly, that seems about right)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember that lamp from Morocco? It's still the ugliest thing we own. It still doesn't work. We're never throwing it away. Some things are too broken to fix and too perfect to change. Like us.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied about the statistical analysis. The real probability you're doing that half-smile thing is 1.00. Some calculations don't require math, just observation. Just love. Just you.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this because I woke up at 4:23 AM from a dream where you didn't exist, and the relief of finding you asleep beside me was so violent I had to document it.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know: Every morning for three years, you've made coffee wrong. Too much water. Not enough grounds. And every morning for three years, I've drunk it anyway because it tastes like home now. Like the specific gravity of us.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got us lost for six hours. The sun was brutal. We ran out of water. You kept apologizing. But Leyi\u2014when we finally found that fountain, you made me drink first. Your lips were cracked and bleeding and you made me drink first. That's when I understood what love actually is: biology overridden by choice.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, unconscious of being watched, pulling the skin off in one long spiral. The afternoon light hit your hands. I couldn't breathe. Three years in and you still stop my lungs without trying.\n\n*\n\nListen\u2014I've been writing my vows since the day we met. Not for a wedding. For right now. For Tuesday mornings. For the mundane accumulation of us:\n\nI vow to love you through every debugging session that runs past 3 AM.\nI vow to love you when you're furious at code that won't compile.\nI vow to love you at your mother's dinner table, translating her disappointment into softer words.\nI vow to love you badly\u2014desperately, clumsily, with my whole body leaning into the curve of yours.\n\n*\n\nThat night in Shanghai when I got food poisoning. You slept on the bathroom floor. Your spine against cold tile. Six hours. When I apologized, you said: \"Shut up. This is where I want to be.\" \n\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\nThis is where I want to be.\n\nI've been repeating it ever since. My prayer. My coordinates. My error message when you're not here.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan our future deaths. Not morbidly. Probabilistically. You'll go first (statistics). I'll follow within the year (also statistics). But here's the thing\u2014even knowing the ending, I would choose this beginning. Every time. In every universe. Even the ones where we only get ten minutes.\n\n*\n\nCambridge. You fell in the Cam. Emerged furious, dripping, cursing in Mandarin. But you were laughing too. Fury and joy at the same time. That's when I knew I would follow you anywhere\u2014into rivers, into anger, into that specific frequency where laughter and tears converge.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check your breathing at night like you might disappear. I save your voicemails in three different places. I'm building an archive of you\u2014not for when you're gone, but for now, while you're here, because even reality needs backup documentation.\n\n*\n\nRemember Shenzhen? Your grandmother's funeral. I didn't understand the rituals but I understood your grief\u2014the way it moved through your body like weather. You let me hold you through it. Let me be your shelter even though I was just as lost. That's what we are: two people lost together, making maps out of each other's breathing.\n\n*\n\nHere's my hypothesis: We're not in love. We ARE love. The thing itself materialized. Love that forgot it was supposed to be abstract and accidentally became two people sharing coffee that's always too weak.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. 2 AM. We were drunk on wine and each other. You taught me to swear in Portuguese. But what I really learned was the shape your mouth makes when you're trying not to laugh. The way joy escapes from you despite yourself. I've been chasing that escape route ever since.\n\n*\n\nYou're reading this now. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're trying not to cry at work. Your coworker will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will break. This is my favorite malfunction\u2014when your professional facade cracks and the real you spills out.\n\n*\n\nI need you to know: You've reorganized my entire molecular structure. I'm not who I was before you. I'm not better or worse. I'm just irrevocably altered. Like light bent around a massive object. You're my gravitational lens. Everything I see goes through you first.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my declaration: I will love you until my last neuron fires. I will love you through dementia and forgetting and the slow dissolution of everything except this\u2014the weight of your hand in mine. The specific texture of your breathing at 3 AM. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" every single time.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you right now. Present tense. This second. As my fingers hit these keys. As your eyes scan these words. As the space between us collapses into nothing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Your keynote. You were brilliant. The room was yours. But afterward, you found me in the crowd and your whole face changed\u2014from public to private, from performance to truth. That transformation. That's what I live for. The moment you stop being everyone's and become mine.\n\n*\n\nLast thing: You asked once if I believe in soulmates. I said no. I still say no. We're not soulmates. We're choices. Daily, hourly, molecular choices to turn toward each other instead of away. That's harder than destiny. That's better than fate. That's us.\n\n*\n\nI love you, Leyi. I love you like a broken bone that healed stronger. Like scar tissue that won't fade. Like memory that won't delete. Like code that won't compile without you as a dependency.\n\nI love you forever but also just for now, just for this moment where you exist and I exist and somehow, against all probability, we exist together.\n\n*\n\nCome home. I'll make you coffee. It will be too strong. You'll drink it anyway. We'll call it even.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like punctuation\u2014invisible but essential, organizing everything into meaning)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That lamp from Morocco is in our bedroom now. Still broken. Still hideous. Still the most beautiful thing we own because you chose it, because you overpaid, because you knew exactly what you were doing. Some things are perfect in their imperfection. Like that lamp. Like us.
