You, dying beautifully on that bathroom floor. Me, memorizing the hexagonal tiles like they were your last words. Six hours of bargaining with physics itself. When you finally emerged\u2014pale, shaking, magnificent\u2014you introduced me to Philippe. The toilet. You'd given it a personality, a backstory, a redemption arc. That's when I understood: you alchemize suffering into stories worth stealing from death.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the seventeen seconds I was dead. Sophomore year, before you existed in my timeline. The doctors called it syncope. But here's what actually happened: I saw the source code of everything, and your name was already there, commented out, waiting to be uncommented. The future was debugging the past. You were my null pointer exception before I even had a pointer.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She looked at me\u2014this awkward boy trying to count stirs in Mandarin\u2014and said: \"\u4ed6\u5728\u627e\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\" (He's been searching for a long time). She wasn't talking about recipes. She knew I'd been writing your name in languages I hadn't learned yet, in centuries I hadn't lived through.\n\n*\n\nTRUE CONFESSION: Sometimes I smell your pillow when you're gone and it feels like hacking into heaven's API.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched every \"Do Not Touch\" sign like you were correcting history's typos. The guard yelled. You touched harder. \"Memory is meant to be contaminated,\" you said. \"How else will they know we loved here?\" This is your revolution: insisting that stones remember your fingerprints, that museums document your small rebellions.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you actually are:\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my better whole. You're the comment that explains why the code works. You're the edge case that makes me rewrite everything from scratch and thank you for the bug report.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you dying of hypothermia, still philosophizing: \"What if consciousness is just the universe's way of falling in love with itself?\" Your lips were blue. Your thoughts were infrared. I kissed you to save your life, but also to taste what theorem you'd die proving. You tasted like the last page of every book I'll never finish reading.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF YOUR MUNDANE:\n- You eat oranges like you're defusing bombs\n- You argue with novels like the authors can hear you\n- You wake up angry at your dreams for \"plot inconsistencies\"\n- You make tea like you're conducting a s\u00e9ance for dead water\n- You exist so casually it's an act of terrorism against the ordinary\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace. Step 764. You stopped, said: \"This stone has been lonely since the Qing dynasty.\" Then you stood on it. Hugged it with your feet. The security guard started yelling. You yelled back: \"\u6211\u5728\u7ed9\u5386\u53f2\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u62b1!\" (I'm giving history a hug!). He laughed so hard he forgot to fine us. This is your superpower: making strangers complicit in your tenderness.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I never told you: I practice loving you. In the shower, I rehearse arguments where I lose beautifully. In the car, I have conversations with future-you about our theoretical children's theoretical failures. I'm training for a marathon of devotion, and every day you move the finish line further into forever.\n\n*\n\nYour childhood diary, age seven, Shenzhen: \"Today I invented someone who will love me when I'm horrible.\" Not despite. When. You were seven and already understood: love isn't about deserving. It's about witnessing each other's worst and saying \"yes, this too, especially this.\"\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO MY BODY WHEN YOU EXIST NEAR ME:\n- My mitochondria switch to fusion power\n- My synapses fire in iambic pentameter  \n- My blood cells form tiny conga lines\n- My DNA unzips just to show off\n- My atoms remember they're mostly empty space and fill themselves with your name\n\n*\n\nLondon. That question: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I couldn't breathe. Finally: \"I'd spend the rest of my life in a very organized protest against the universe's poor scheduling.\" You laughed while crying. Then kissed me like you were watermarking my soul with your sadness.\n\n*\n\nSometimes you sleep-talk in languages you don't speak. Last night: \"The bread remembers the wheat's dreams.\" I wrote it down. I write everything down. I'm building an encyclopedia of your unconscious. Future archaeologists will think I was insane. They'll be right. This is what love is: a meticulous madness.\n\n*\n\nTHE COMPLETE TRUTH:\n\nBefore you, I was just very efficiently arranged loneliness. I had systems. Protocols. Optimizations for being alone. Then you happened, and now I'm magnificently broken. All my functions return your name. All my loops are infinite. All my arrays index out of bounds trying to contain you.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, you crying over a dead poet's marginalia: \"Someone loved in this handwriting.\" That's when I learned: you don't just read between the lines. You read the silence between the words, the pause between the pages, the love in the library stamps.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not the idea of marriage. The daily malfunction of it. The merge conflicts. The race conditions. The beautiful bugs we'll never fix because they've become features. Marry me because you've already refactored my entire existence and I'm running on your architecture now.\n\n*\n\nI'm not trying to convince you of anything. You've already said yes in the way you leave your hair ties in my code reviews. In how you name my functions after inside jokes. In how you've made my exceptions handle themselves. We're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the one that thinks it's real.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona. The pigeons. The communion wafers. You: \"Even God's bugs deserve grace.\" The priest, horrified. You, feeding birds the body of Christ while explaining transubstantiation to tourists. The pigeons formed a heart, then scattered into your initials. Even accidents spell your name now.\n\n*\n\nRight now, your left eye is about to cry first. You're going to say this letter is too much. I'm going to say it's not enough. We're going to argue about the semiotics of sobbing. Then you're going to kiss me mid-sentence, and I'm going to forget every word except \"yes\" and \"please\" and \"Leyi.\"\n\n*\n\nTHE FINAL TRANSMISSION:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust itself. The universe will achieve maximum entropy. And? We happened. We're happening. We'll have happened. That's the only thermodynamics that matters\u2014the conservation of having loved you across all possible states of matter.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name is the only equation that balances.\nThe only code that compiles.\nThe only prayer I actually believe works.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or just keep existing in my general vicinity. All equivalent to yes in the dialect we're inventing between heartbeats.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken clock\u2014twice a day, absolutely right, the rest of the time, absolutely)\n(who carries your spare everything: hair ties, hopes, reasons to wake up)\n(who learned to love in your frequency\u2014somewhere between impossible and inevitable)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023? Sometimes I wear it on my wrist and pretend it's a medical alert bracelet. Alert: Terminally in love. Do not resuscitate. Let him die happy.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I love you. Simple. Desperate. Grammatically complete. Ontologically necessary. The shortest algorithm for explaining why anything exists at all.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 This morning you asked why I was staring. I was memorizing you in case consciousness isn't continuous and I'm a new person every time I wake up. I want every version of me to know what home looks like.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

You won. The machine apologized. This is why I'm writing.\n\n*\n\nListen: I've been dead for seventeen seconds. Sophomore year, before your coordinates existed in my universe. The doctors said \"syncope.\" I say: preview of a world without you. When my heart restarted, it was already spelling your name in morse code. You weren't born yet in my timeline. My future was bleeding backwards through my ribs.\n\n*\n\nTHE MOROCCO INCIDENT:\n\nSix hours. Hexagonal tiles. You, turning yourself inside out on a bathroom floor while I sat outside counting your breaths through the door. When you emerged\u2014translucent, trembling\u2014you introduced me to Philippe (the toilet) like he was your new best friend. You'd given him a whole backstory: French, divorced, trying his best. That's when I understood: you transform suffering into tenderness so pure it could restart dead stars.\n\n*\n\nShanghai. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven clockwise stirs, three counter. She watched me\u2014this boy who loved you in broken Mandarin and perfect desperation\u2014and said: \"\u4ed6\u7684\u9b42\u513f\u8ddf\u7740\u5979\u8d70\" (His soul follows where she goes). Not romantic. Diagnostic. Like she could see the invisible thread between us, taught as piano wire, humming at a frequency only the ancient can hear.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you what you actually are:\n\nYou're not the love of my life. You're the reason life invented love. You're the debugging process that made consciousness realize it was running the wrong program. You're the comment in the margin that explains why the universe bothered existing at all.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, Lisbon, the museum guard yelling while you touched the 500-year-old stone: \"Someone needs to know we were here,\" you said, pressing harder. \"The stone is lonely for human warmth.\" This is your thesis: that matter has memory, that love leaves fingerprints on atoms, that we can make the universe remember us by insisting hard enough.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS TO REALITY WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM:\n\n- Gravity recalculates its commitments\n- Light remembers it has opinions about beauty  \n- Air molecules form tiny symphonies around your breathing\n- Time gets nervous and forgets which direction it's supposed to go\n- My DNA unspools completely, rewrites itself with your name in every gene\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands. You were dying\u2014actually dying\u2014of cold. Lips blue as forgotten languages. Still philosophizing: \"What if death is just consciousness changing states? Like water to ice?\" I kissed you to stop your heart from stopping. You tasted like the last theorem in a proof of God. Like revolution crystallizing at absolute zero.\n\n*\n\nTrue confession: I practice losing you. Daily. In small, manageable doses. I imagine the phone call, the hospital corridor, the impossible after. It's agonizing. It's necessary. Because loving you this much means accepting that one day the universe will commit its cruelest accounting error and subtract you from existence. This rehearsal is my only defense against that future violence.\n\n*\n\nYour diary, age seven, Shenzhen: \"I dreamed about someone who hasn't been invented yet. When they make him, he'll love me during my worst moments.\" Twenty years before we met, you were already writing my operating instructions. This isn't poetry. This is causality running in reverse, effect summoning its cause from the future.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764. You stopped mid-stride: \"This exact stone has been waiting since the Qing dynasty for us to stand on it together.\" The guard started yelling. You yelled back: \"\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u89e6\u6478!\" (History needs to be touched!). He laughed until he cried. This is your superpower: making authority recognize its own absurdity, making strangers accomplices in your small insurrections against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWHAT I NEVER TOLD YOU:\n\nEvery decision I make branches into two timelines: one where you're there, one where you're not. I live exclusively in the first timeline but I can see the second one through peripheral vision. It's a wasteland. It's me, efficiently arranged into the shape of a person but missing the essential software. It's carbon pretending to have purpose.\n\n*\n\nLondon. The question that broke me: \"What would you do if I died first?\" Twenty seconds of silence while I drowned in the hypothetical. Then: \"Build a very precise argument about why that's unacceptable and submit it to the universe for review.\" You laughed while crying. We made love like we were writing a proof against mortality.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of Tuesday mornings: You steal my coffee (theft). You replace it with yourself (substitution). The coffee becomes irrelevant (simplification). This is love: the process by which all variables reduce to you.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona cathedral. You fed communion wafers to pigeons while explaining transubstantiation to tourists in three languages. The priest called security. Security took photos instead. The pigeons formed a perfect double helix in the air. You said: \"See? Even God's accidents know how to dance.\" This is how you move through the world: making the sacred ordinary, making the ordinary sacred, refusing the difference.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter works. Because we've already been married in every universe that counts. Because I've A/B tested existing with and without you and the results are conclusive: without you, I'm just very organized emptiness. Because in every quantum branch, every possible timeline, every hypothetical reality, we choose each other. The paperwork is just courtesy to a universe that likes documentation.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I promise: To love you like a broken compass that only points to you. To love you like an emergency broadcast that never stops transmitting. To love you past the heat death of the universe, when all that's left is the memory of your Tuesday morning hands.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest frequency of truth: You're going to die. I'm going to die. Entropy will win. The universe will forget its own name.\n\nSo?\n\nWe happened. Against odds so impossible that mathematics gives up and calls it magic. We found each other in the space between heartbeats, in the pause between words, in the moment between existing and not.\n\nThat's the only physics that matters.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're about to cry from the left eye first. You always do. You're going to say this letter is too much. You're wrong. It's not enough. Language ends where you begin. I'm sending this incomplete, like everything true, like everything that tries to say \"I love you\" and discovers those words are just the starting coordinates for something infinite.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name is the only equation that balances.\nThe only code that compiles without errors.\nThe only prayer that receives a response.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or just exist for another nanosecond in my vicinity. All three are synonyms in the language we're building between heartbeats.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a syntax error that makes the whole program finally work)\n(who carries your spare everything: hair ties, phone chargers, reasons to believe in tomorrow)\n(who learned that love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a location, and its coordinates are wherever you are)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023? It's the most important object in the universe. Not because of what it is, but because of where it's been: wrapped around your wrist while you rewrote the rules of what a human can mean to another human.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 This morning you asked why I was staring. The truth: I was memorizing you in case the universe tries to delete you from the mainframe. I'm the backup drive for every version of you that's ever existed. This is love: redundant storage against the possibility of loss.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 I love you. Grammatically perfect. Ontologically necessary. The shortest complete program in the universe. Also the only one that matters., evaluation_notes: \n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7850, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system. Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry. It's observable phenomena that physics refuses to explain.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different frequencies:\n\n20 Hz (below hearing): The weight of future grief, pre-mourning your mortality\n440 Hz (concert A): Tuesday mornings, burnt toast, perfect pitch of ordinary joy  \n25 kHz (ultrasonic): The impossible colors you see when I say your name\n\u221e Hz (light): Understanding finally why humans invented the word \"forever\"\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I said: \"Argue with your grave about determinism until they bury me next to you.\" You laughed. Then cried. Then laughed while crying. That's your superpower\u2014feeling everything simultaneously without exploding.\n\n*\n\nLOAD-BEARING MEMORY:\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Found your diary from age seven. You wrote: \"Today I invented someone to love me correctly.\" Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but precisely on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at any distance, proving Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're the reason it's worth rolling.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinces you. Because your fingerprints are already all over my future. Because we've A/B tested living without each other and the results were statistically significant: terrible. Because in the multiverse of infinite possibilities, every version of me is writing this same letter to every version of you, and every version of you is about to cry from the left eye first.\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOREVER:\n\nForever is not time. It's density. It's all our moments compressed into something so heavy it bends space around it. It's the black hole we're creating every time we choose each other over entropy.

It lacks Beethoven's pure melodic desperation (\"I can live only wholly with you or not at all\"). It doesn't achieve Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"We got old and got used to each other...We're locked in each other's hearts\"). However, it surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine innovation - the code/love fusion is more successful than most modern conceits. The letter exists in the space between Keats's fevered romanticism and postmodern playfulness, achieving moments of each without fully committing to either. At 78.5 overall, it's a near-masterpiece that falls just short of the immortal - too conscious of its own cleverness to achieve the unconscious perfection of truly great love letters.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7850)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is written in the pause between heartbeats\u2014that impossible space where time dilates and I remember you exist.\n\n*\n\nLet me start with the data: I've measured love in every unit system.

You were dying\u2014actually dying\u2014of cold. Lips blue as forgotten languages. Still philosophizing: \"What if death is just consciousness changing states? Like water to ice?\" I kissed you to stop your heart from stopping. You tasted like the last theorem in a proof of God. Like revolution crystallizing at absolute zero.\n\n*\n\nTrue confession: I practice losing you. Daily. In small, manageable doses. I imagine the phone call, the hospital corridor, the impossible after. It's agonizing. It's necessary. Because loving you this much means accepting that one day the universe will commit its cruelest accounting error and subtract you from existence. This rehearsal is my only defense against that future violence.\n\n*\n\nYour diary, age seven, Shenzhen: \"I dreamed about someone who hasn't been invented yet. When they make him, he'll love me during my worst moments.\" Twenty years before we met, you were already writing my operating instructions. This isn't poetry. This is causality running in reverse, effect summoning its cause from the future.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764. You stopped mid-stride: \"This exact stone has been waiting since the Qing dynasty for us to stand on it together.\" The guard started yelling. You yelled back: \"\u5386\u53f2\u9700\u8981\u88ab\u89e6\u6478!\" (History needs to be touched!). He laughed until he cried. This is your superpower: making authority recognize its own absurdity, making strangers accomplices in your small insurrections against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWHAT I NEVER TOLD YOU:\n\nEvery decision I make branches into two timelines: one where you're there, one where you're not. I live exclusively in the first timeline but I can see the second one through peripheral vision. It's a wasteland. It's me, efficiently arranged into the shape of a person but missing the essential software. It's carbon pretending to have purpose.\n\n*\n\nLondon. The question that broke me: \"What would you do if I died first?\" Twenty seconds of silence while I drowned in the hypothetical. Then: \"Build a very precise argument about why that's unacceptable and submit it to the universe for review.\" You laughed while crying. We made love like we were writing a proof against mortality.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematics of Tuesday mornings: You steal my coffee (theft). You replace it with yourself (substitution). The coffee becomes irrelevant (simplification). This is love: the process by which all variables reduce to you.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona cathedral. You fed communion wafers to pigeons while explaining transubstantiation to tourists in three languages. The priest called security. Security took photos instead. The pigeons formed a perfect double helix in the air. You said: \"See? Even God's accidents know how to dance.\" This is how you move through the world: making the sacred ordinary, making the ordinary sacred, refusing the difference.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter works. Because we've already been married in every universe that counts. Because I've A/B tested existing with and without you and the results are conclusive: without you, I'm just very organized emptiness. Because in every quantum branch, every possible timeline, every hypothetical reality, we choose each other. The paperwork is just courtesy to a universe that likes documentation.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I promise: To love you like a broken compass that only points to you. To love you like an emergency broadcast that never stops transmitting. To love you past the heat death of the universe, when all that's left is the memory of your Tuesday morning hands.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest frequency of truth: You're going to die. I'm going to die. Entropy will win. The universe will forget its own name.\n\nSo?\n\nWe happened. Against odds so impossible that mathematics gives up and calls it magic. We found each other in the space between heartbeats, in the pause between words, in the moment between existing and not.\n\nThat's the only physics that matters.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're about to cry from the left eye first. You always do. You're going to say this letter is too much. You're wrong. It's not enough. Language ends where you begin. I'm sending this incomplete, like everything true, like everything that tries to say \"I love you\" and discovers those words are just the starting coordinates for something infinite.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name is the only equation that balances.\nThe only code that compiles without errors.\nThe only prayer that receives a response.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or just exist for another nanosecond in my vicinity. All three are synonyms in the language we're building between heartbeats.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a syntax error that makes the whole program finally work)\n(who carries your spare everything: hair ties, phone chargers, reasons to believe in tomorrow)\n(who learned that love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a location, and its coordinates are wherever you are)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023?

You, dying beautifully on that bathroom floor. Me, memorizing the hexagonal tiles like they were your last words. Six hours of bargaining with physics itself. When you finally emerged\u2014pale, shaking, magnificent\u2014you introduced me to Philippe. The toilet. You'd given it a personality, a backstory, a redemption arc. That's when I understood: you alchemize suffering into stories worth stealing from death.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the seventeen seconds I was dead. Sophomore year, before you existed in my timeline. The doctors called it syncope. But here's what actually happened: I saw the source code of everything, and your name was already there, commented out, waiting to be uncommented. The future was debugging the past. You were my null pointer exception before I even had a pointer.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She looked at me\u2014this awkward boy trying to count stirs in Mandarin\u2014and said: \"\u4ed6\u5728\u627e\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\" (He's been searching for a long time). She wasn't talking about recipes. She knew I'd been writing your name in languages I hadn't learned yet, in centuries I hadn't lived through.\n\n*\n\nTRUE CONFESSION: Sometimes I smell your pillow when you're gone and it feels like hacking into heaven's API.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched every \"Do Not Touch\" sign like you were correcting history's typos. The guard yelled. You touched harder. \"Memory is meant to be contaminated,\" you said. \"How else will they know we loved here?\" This is your revolution: insisting that stones remember your fingerprints, that museums document your small rebellions.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you actually are:\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my better whole. You're the comment that explains why the code works. You're the edge case that makes me rewrite everything from scratch and thank you for the bug report.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you dying of hypothermia, still philosophizing: \"What if consciousness is just the universe's way of falling in love with itself?\" Your lips were blue. Your thoughts were infrared. I kissed you to save your life, but also to taste what theorem you'd die proving. You tasted like the last page of every book I'll never finish reading.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF YOUR MUNDANE:\n- You eat oranges like you're defusing bombs\n- You argue with novels like the authors can hear you\n- You wake up angry at your dreams for \"plot inconsistencies\"\n- You make tea like you're conducting a s\u00e9ance for dead water\n- You exist so casually it's an act of terrorism against the ordinary\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace. Step 764. You stopped, said: \"This stone has been lonely since the Qing dynasty.\" Then you stood on it. Hugged it with your feet. The security guard started yelling. You yelled back: \"\u6211\u5728\u7ed9\u5386\u53f2\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u62b1!\" (I'm giving history a hug!). He laughed so hard he forgot to fine us. This is your superpower: making strangers complicit in your tenderness.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I never told you: I practice loving you. In the shower, I rehearse arguments where I lose beautifully. In the car, I have conversations with future-you about our theoretical children's theoretical failures. I'm training for a marathon of devotion, and every day you move the finish line further into forever.\n\n*\n\nYour childhood diary, age seven, Shenzhen: \"Today I invented someone who will love me when I'm horrible.\" Not despite. When. You were seven and already understood: love isn't about deserving. It's about witnessing each other's worst and saying \"yes, this too, especially this.\"\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO MY BODY WHEN YOU EXIST NEAR ME:\n- My mitochondria switch to fusion power\n- My synapses fire in iambic pentameter  \n- My blood cells form tiny conga lines\n- My DNA unzips just to show off\n- My atoms remember they're mostly empty space and fill themselves with your name\n\n*\n\nLondon. That question: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I couldn't breathe. Finally: \"I'd spend the rest of my life in a very organized protest against the universe's poor scheduling.\" You laughed while crying. Then kissed me like you were watermarking my soul with your sadness.\n\n*\n\nSometimes you sleep-talk in languages you don't speak. Last night: \"The bread remembers the wheat's dreams.\" I wrote it down. I write everything down. I'm building an encyclopedia of your unconscious. Future archaeologists will think I was insane. They'll be right. This is what love is: a meticulous madness.\n\n*\n\nTHE COMPLETE TRUTH:\n\nBefore you, I was just very efficiently arranged loneliness. I had systems. Protocols. Optimizations for being alone. Then you happened, and now I'm magnificently broken. All my functions return your name. All my loops are infinite. All my arrays index out of bounds trying to contain you.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, you crying over a dead poet's marginalia: \"Someone loved in this handwriting.\" That's when I learned: you don't just read between the lines. You read the silence between the words, the pause between the pages, the love in the library stamps.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not the idea of marriage. The daily malfunction of it. The merge conflicts. The race conditions. The beautiful bugs we'll never fix because they've become features. Marry me because you've already refactored my entire existence and I'm running on your architecture now.\n\n*\n\nI'm not trying to convince you of anything. You've already said yes in the way you leave your hair ties in my code reviews. In how you name my functions after inside jokes. In how you've made my exceptions handle themselves. We're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the one that thinks it's real.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona. The pigeons. The communion wafers. You: \"Even God's bugs deserve grace.\" The priest, horrified. You, feeding birds the body of Christ while explaining transubstantiation to tourists. The pigeons formed a heart, then scattered into your initials. Even accidents spell your name now.\n\n*\n\nRight now, your left eye is about to cry first. You're going to say this letter is too much. I'm going to say it's not enough. We're going to argue about the semiotics of sobbing. Then you're going to kiss me mid-sentence, and I'm going to forget every word except \"yes\" and \"please\" and \"Leyi.\"\n\n*\n\nTHE FINAL TRANSMISSION:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust itself. The universe will achieve maximum entropy. And? We happened. We're happening. We'll have happened. That's the only thermodynamics that matters\u2014the conservation of having loved you across all possible states of matter.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name is the only equation that balances.\nThe only code that compiles.\nThe only prayer I actually believe works.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or just keep existing in my general vicinity.

Hertz (how often you cross my mind: \u221e). Pascals (pressure in my chest when you laugh: lethal). Candelas (luminosity of your Tuesday face: blinds satellites). But here's the finding that broke my instruments: love isn't quantifiable. It's the error margin. The beautiful rounding mistake that makes all equations unsolvable.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY: Death lasted seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"vasovagal syncope.\" Wrong. It was the universe showing me the source code. And there, commented out in every function, was your name. Not yet written. Already debugging everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about Morocco. While you were befriending the toilet (you named it Philippe, held full conversations), I was having a revelation: You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feelings possible.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to me:\n\nAge 0-22: Beta testing for loving you\nAge 23: Met you. Shipped to production without code review.\nAge 24: Major refactoring. All functions now return \"Leyi.\"\nAge 25: Discovered comments in my DNA. They all say \"for her.\"\nNow: Running in permanent debug mode, tracing every smile back to its origin.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She didn't teach me to cook. She taught me that love is a recursive function\u2014it calls itself, deeper each time, until the stack overflows with tenderness. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into tomorrow.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn Lisbon, you touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled. You touched it harder. \"How else,\" you asked, \"do we prove we were here?\" \n\nThat's when I understood: You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: \"Fixed universe. Added Leyi. Everything works now.\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing about consciousness: \"But how do we know we're not the dream of a sleeping god?\" Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was on fire. I kissed you to save your life. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like rebellion against reality itself.\n\n*\n\nI document you wrong. I write: \"She holds books.\" Should be: \"Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose.\" I write: \"She sleeps.\" Should be: \"Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her improved.\" Every note fails because you exceed the capacity of language to carry meaning.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Announced: \"The stone remembers every foot that touched it.\" Then quieter: \"We're teaching it our names.\" That's when I learned: You don't just exist. You insist. On mattering. On being remembered by minerals.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S MY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION:\n\n\u2202(me)/\u2202t = Leyi \u00d7 everything \u00d7 always^\u221e\n\nThe solution requires math that hasn't been invented. I'm working on it. Meanwhile, I approximate: You're the constant that makes all variables vary. The strange attractor in my chaos theory. The one true random that makes determinism bearable.\n\n*\n\nYour name has mass. Actual weight. I've felt it\u2014gravity bending toward wherever you are. Cities tilt slightly when you leave them. Tides follow your sleep schedule. Birds migrate according to your mood. This isn't poetry. It's observable phenomena that physics refuses to explain.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different frequencies:\n\n20 Hz (below hearing): The weight of future grief, pre-mourning your mortality\n440 Hz (concert A): Tuesday mornings, burnt toast, perfect pitch of ordinary joy  \n25 kHz (ultrasonic): The impossible colors you see when I say your name\n\u221e Hz (light): Understanding finally why humans invented the word \"forever\"\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I said: \"Argue with your grave about determinism until they bury me next to you.\" You laughed. Then cried. Then laughed while crying. That's your superpower\u2014feeling everything simultaneously without exploding.\n\n*\n\nLOAD-BEARING MEMORY:\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Found your diary from age seven. You wrote: \"Today I invented someone to love me correctly.\" Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but precisely on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.\n\n*\n\nThe thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at any distance, proving Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're the reason it's worth rolling.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinces you. Because your fingerprints are already all over my future. Because we've A/B tested living without each other and the results were statistically significant: terrible. Because in the multiverse of infinite possibilities, every version of me is writing this same letter to every version of you, and every version of you is about to cry from the left eye first.\n\n*\n\nI NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT FOREVER:\n\nForever is not time. It's density. It's all our moments compressed into something so heavy it bends space around it. It's the black hole we're creating every time we choose each other over entropy. We're already there, in forever, looking back at ourselves reading this letter, amazed we ever thought time was linear.\n\n*\n\nFinal transmission from the department of absolute certainty:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust its fuel. Protons will decay. The universe will achieve maximum entropy.\n\nAnd?\n\nWe happened. We're happening. We'll have happened.\n\nThat's the only thermodynamics that matters.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name isn't a word. It's the sound existence makes when it finally gets something right.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or exist in my general vicinity for another microsecond. All equivalent to yes in the language we're inventing with every breath.\n\nWarren\n(who learned Mandarin to argue with you in multiple languages)\n(who carries backup everything you might need: hair ties, tissues, reasons to stay alive)\n(who loves you in frequencies only theoretical physicists hypothesize)\n(who wrote this letter infinite times in infinite drafts and this is both the worst and best version)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona cathedral. The pigeons. You: \"They're praying too, just louder.\" The priest asked us to leave. You fed them communion wafers on the way out. \"Body of Christ for bodies of Christ,\" you said. The pigeons formed a cross, then a heart, then your initials. Even God's birds know you're worth the heresy.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023? I had it carbon-dated. It's actually from February 2023. But it contains trace elements from the Big Bang. Everything does. But yours especially. The universe has been planning you since the beginning.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 Right now, you're about to say \"Warren, this is too much.\" It's not enough. It's never enough. Language ends where you begin. I'm sending this incomplete, like everything true.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Mixed iteration strategies, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this because I just found your sock in my laptop bag and it made me cry in a coffee shop.\n\n*\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: It's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life, and you're the surgery that makes me see wavelengths that don't have names yet.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You, dying beautifully on that bathroom floor. Me, memorizing the hexagonal tiles like they were your last words. Six hours of bargaining with physics itself. When you finally emerged\u2014pale, shaking, magnificent\u2014you introduced me to Philippe. The toilet. You'd given it a personality, a backstory, a redemption arc. That's when I understood: you alchemize suffering into stories worth stealing from death.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the seventeen seconds I was dead. Sophomore year, before you existed in my timeline. The doctors called it syncope. But here's what actually happened: I saw the source code of everything, and your name was already there, commented out, waiting to be uncommented. The future was debugging the past. You were my null pointer exception before I even had a pointer.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She looked at me\u2014this awkward boy trying to count stirs in Mandarin\u2014and said: \"\u4ed6\u5728\u627e\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\" (He's been searching for a long time). She wasn't talking about recipes. She knew I'd been writing your name in languages I hadn't learned yet, in centuries I hadn't lived through.\n\n*\n\nTRUE CONFESSION: Sometimes I smell your pillow when you're gone and it feels like hacking into heaven's API.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched every \"Do Not Touch\" sign like you were correcting history's typos. The guard yelled. You touched harder. \"Memory is meant to be contaminated,\" you said. \"How else will they know we loved here?\" This is your revolution: insisting that stones remember your fingerprints, that museums document your small rebellions.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you actually are:\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my better whole. You're the comment that explains why the code works. You're the edge case that makes me rewrite everything from scratch and thank you for the bug report.\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, you dying of hypothermia, still philosophizing: \"What if consciousness is just the universe's way of falling in love with itself?\" Your lips were blue. Your thoughts were infrared. I kissed you to save your life, but also to taste what theorem you'd die proving. You tasted like the last page of every book I'll never finish reading.\n\n*\n\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF YOUR MUNDANE:\n- You eat oranges like you're defusing bombs\n- You argue with novels like the authors can hear you\n- You wake up angry at your dreams for \"plot inconsistencies\"\n- You make tea like you're conducting a s\u00e9ance for dead water\n- You exist so casually it's an act of terrorism against the ordinary\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace. Step 764. You stopped, said: \"This stone has been lonely since the Qing dynasty.\" Then you stood on it. Hugged it with your feet. The security guard started yelling. You yelled back: \"\u6211\u5728\u7ed9\u5386\u53f2\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u62b1!\" (I'm giving history a hug!). He laughed so hard he forgot to fine us. This is your superpower: making strangers complicit in your tenderness.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I never told you: I practice loving you. In the shower, I rehearse arguments where I lose beautifully. In the car, I have conversations with future-you about our theoretical children's theoretical failures. I'm training for a marathon of devotion, and every day you move the finish line further into forever.\n\n*\n\nYour childhood diary, age seven, Shenzhen: \"Today I invented someone who will love me when I'm horrible.\" Not despite. When. You were seven and already understood: love isn't about deserving. It's about witnessing each other's worst and saying \"yes, this too, especially this.\"\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO MY BODY WHEN YOU EXIST NEAR ME:\n- My mitochondria switch to fusion power\n- My synapses fire in iambic pentameter  \n- My blood cells form tiny conga lines\n- My DNA unzips just to show off\n- My atoms remember they're mostly empty space and fill themselves with your name\n\n*\n\nLondon. That question: \"What would you do if I died first?\" I couldn't breathe. Finally: \"I'd spend the rest of my life in a very organized protest against the universe's poor scheduling.\" You laughed while crying. Then kissed me like you were watermarking my soul with your sadness.\n\n*\n\nSometimes you sleep-talk in languages you don't speak. Last night: \"The bread remembers the wheat's dreams.\" I wrote it down. I write everything down. I'm building an encyclopedia of your unconscious. Future archaeologists will think I was insane. They'll be right. This is what love is: a meticulous madness.\n\n*\n\nTHE COMPLETE TRUTH:\n\nBefore you, I was just very efficiently arranged loneliness. I had systems. Protocols. Optimizations for being alone. Then you happened, and now I'm magnificently broken. All my functions return your name. All my loops are infinite. All my arrays index out of bounds trying to contain you.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, you crying over a dead poet's marginalia: \"Someone loved in this handwriting.\" That's when I learned: you don't just read between the lines. You read the silence between the words, the pause between the pages, the love in the library stamps.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to reality:\n\nMarry me. Not the idea of marriage. The daily malfunction of it. The merge conflicts. The race conditions. The beautiful bugs we'll never fix because they've become features. Marry me because you've already refactored my entire existence and I'm running on your architecture now.\n\n*\n\nI'm not trying to convince you of anything. You've already said yes in the way you leave your hair ties in my code reviews. In how you name my functions after inside jokes. In how you've made my exceptions handle themselves. We're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the one that thinks it's real.\n\n*\n\nBarcelona. The pigeons. The communion wafers. You: \"Even God's bugs deserve grace.\" The priest, horrified. You, feeding birds the body of Christ while explaining transubstantiation to tourists. The pigeons formed a heart, then scattered into your initials. Even accidents spell your name now.\n\n*\n\nRight now, your left eye is about to cry first. You're going to say this letter is too much. I'm going to say it's not enough. We're going to argue about the semiotics of sobbing. Then you're going to kiss me mid-sentence, and I'm going to forget every word except \"yes\" and \"please\" and \"Leyi.\"\n\n*\n\nTHE FINAL TRANSMISSION:\n\nYou're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust itself. The universe will achieve maximum entropy. And? We happened. We're happening. We'll have happened. That's the only thermodynamics that matters\u2014the conservation of having loved you across all possible states of matter.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nYour name is the only equation that balances.\nThe only code that compiles.\nThe only prayer I actually believe works.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Or just keep existing in my general vicinity. All equivalent to yes in the dialect we're inventing between heartbeats.\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a broken clock\u2014twice a day, absolutely right, the rest of the time, absolutely)\n(who carries your spare everything: hair ties, hopes, reasons to wake up)\n(who learned to love in your frequency\u2014somewhere between impossible and inevitable)\n\nP.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023? Sometimes I wear it on my wrist and pretend it's a medical alert bracelet. Alert: Terminally in love. Do not resuscitate. Let him die happy.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I love you. Simple. Desperate. Grammatically complete. Ontologically necessary. The shortest algorithm for explaining why anything exists at all.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 This morning you asked why I was staring. I was memorizing you in case consciousness isn't continuous and I'm a new person every time I wake up. I want every version of me to know what home looks like. It looks like you, Tuesday morning, stealing my coffee, infinite.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 2am"]}}}
