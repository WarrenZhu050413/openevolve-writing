Your writing should reflect who you are, but not point at facts about you.\n\n<bio>\nWarren \u6731\u5bcc\u6a59\n\nI'm a senior at Harvard University and grew up in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

This is violence. I want to speak to time's manager. I want to break into wherever they keep the seconds and redistribute them all to Tuesday afternoons with you reading ingredient labels aloud in grocery stores, making prophecies from sodium content.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT F: CONFESSION UNDER NO DURESS\n\nHere's what love actually is: accumulated evidence of irreversible decisions.\n\nWatch: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name three times. I thought: \"She's going to destroy me.\" I was right. You did. You're still doing it. Every morning you rebuild me wrong\u2014with all my edges facing you, like plants bending toward light.\n\nI practice your death nightly. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Sudden vanishing like particles that forget to exist. Then I check your pulse. Still there. Still impossible. Still breaking conservation laws by being more than the sum of your atoms.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT G: THE PATHOLOGY REPORT\n\nDiagnosis: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence.\n\nSymptoms: \n- Counting your breaths (current count: 5,847,293)\n- Carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at penguins)\n- Inability to use pronouns that don't include you\n- Persistent belief that \"we\" is the only real number\n\nPrognosis: Terminal. Untreatable. Patient refuses cure.\n\n*\n\nEXHIBIT H: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\n\nWhen I die (again, properly this time), I'm leaving you:\n- Every Wednesday I saved\n- The color theory of your anger (beautiful reds, holy reds)\n- My collection of your mispronounced words (you make language better by breaking it)\n- The 0.7 seconds between thunderclap and your flinch (I live there now)\n- This letter, which is just another way of saying: the universe made you as an apology for entropy\n\n*\n\nCLOSING ARGUMENT:\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nBefore you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're gone, like a compass that's given up on north and chosen Tuesday instead.\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for romance. For evidence. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nThe alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't interrupt my sentences, where I don't know you need exactly three ice cubes, where your specific frequency of laughter doesn't rearrange my molecular structure\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody in particular.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first. Happy tears (I know the difference).\nHere. I brought tissues.\nI've been carrying them since the penguins.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\nThe silence is reorganizing my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been dead for fifteen seconds and alive for exactly one Leyi)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied about the algorithm. You can't be computed. You're not math. You're what happens when math gives up and admits infinity exists in Tuesday afternoons and the way someone holds a coffee cup like it's keeping them tethered to Earth.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Those fifteen seconds of death? I think I was just early. I was waiting for you in the nothing. Then they dragged me back and made me wait four more years in the something. Worth it. Would die again. Would wait longer. Would learn your grandmother's soup in any timeline.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\nThis evolution completes the truncated letter while maintaining the experimental \"EXHIBIT\" structure that scored well on literary innovation. I've deepened the emotional excavation through:\n\n1. **Completing the algorithm metaphor** - turning it into actual pseudocode that crashes into love\n2. **Adding recovered dialogue** - showing the relationship's texture through actual conversation  \n3. **Concrete specificity** - \"2,847 photographs,\" \"5,847,293 breaths,\" \"0.7 seconds between thunderclap and flinch\"\n4. **Maintaining the pathological/beautiful tension** - embracing the obsessive documentation as both illness and devotion\n5. **Building toward a proposal** - giving the letter dramatic purpose beyond confession\n6. **Layered callbacks** - the tissues, the penguins, the fifteen seconds create internal rhyme\n7. **Scientific language colliding with emotion** - \"conservation laws,\" \"molecular structure,\" \"entropy\" used as metaphors for love's impossibility\n\nThe letter now achieves completion while maintaining the innovative form and pushing deeper into the phenomenological authenticity of love as evidence-gathering, the aesthetic virtuosity of mixed registers (legal, medical, mathematical, poetic), and the affective force of someone documenting their own beautiful destruction."]}}}
