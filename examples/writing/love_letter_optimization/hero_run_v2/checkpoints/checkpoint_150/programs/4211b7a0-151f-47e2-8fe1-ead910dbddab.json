How they're all the same Tuesday\u2014the one where you exist and I notice.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to my body when we met:\n\nMy mitochondria started producing 23% more ATP. Measured it. My synapses began firing in patterns that spell your name in brain electricity. My bones started keeping time to your walking rhythm, even when you're cities away. This isn't poetry. This is what you did to my biology. I'm a different species now. One that only makes sense near you.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about those fifteen seconds I was dead:\n\nI wasn't nowhere. I was everywhere you'd ever been. Porto at age seven, crying over dropped ice cream. Shanghai at sixteen, reading under blankets with a flashlight. Boston, twenty-three, about to drop a pen. I wasn't seeing your future\u2014I was remembering your past from inside it. When my heart restarted, it beat in your rhythm. Still does. Listen\u2014tum-TUM-tum. That's \"Le-YI-yi.\" My cardiac muscle learned your name before my mouth did.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. Between your third and fourth bout of vomiting, you said: \"Warren, I think my soul is leaving through my mouth.\" I said: \"I'll catch it.\" You laughed so hard you threw up again. But here's what you don't know\u2014I meant it. I would have caught your soul in my bare hands. Held it while your body sorted itself out. Fed it back to you mouth-to-mouth like oxygen.\n\nThat's what love is. Being willing to hold someone's soul while their body fails.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, 3 PM, too much August:\n\nShe wasn't teaching me to cook. She was teaching me how you were built. \"Forty-seven stirs clockwise, three counter. Like Leyi's thinking\u2014mostly forward, sometimes backward to check.\" She knew you in vegetables and timing. Loved you in steam and salt. When she died, you stirred soup for hours, crying. I counted. 2,847 stirs. You were trying to stir her back into existence.\n\n*\n\nScotland. You were dying of cold and still arguing philosophy:\n\n\"Consciousness might be fundamental, like gravity,\" you said through chattering teeth.\n\"You're hypothermic,\" I said.\n\"Irrelevant to the argument,\" you said.\nYour lips were blue. Your syntax was breaking. You were choosing thought over survival.\nI kissed you to stop you talking. Also to push my heat into you. Also because your wrongness was so beautiful I needed to taste it.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, mathematically:\n\nYour cells replace themselves every seven years.\nThe you I met doesn't exist anymore.\nThe you reading this won't exist in seven years.\nI'm in love with a ship of Theseus.\nBut here's the thing about your particular ship\u2014every new plank learns the shape of the old one.\nYour body keeps rebuilding you exactly wrong in exactly the same way.\nEven your atoms know they're perfect incorrectly.\n\n*\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence that you existed:\n\n- 847 photos where you're not looking at the camera (you're always looking at something more interesting)\n- 73 voice memos of you arguing with automated phone systems\n- That green hair tie that lives in my pocket like a religion\n- 14 of your used coffee cups I couldn't throw away (they have your lip prints in chapstick and DNA)\n- A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said \"I love you\" (1,749) and the subtle differences (Tuesday ones are 0.3 seconds longer)\n\nThis isn't creepy. This is archaeology. I'm preserving you for the future version of me who won't believe you were real.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, the museum, you versus 500-year-old marble:\n\nYou didn't just touch it. You pressed your whole palm flat, fingers spread. The alarm screamed. You didn't move. Security running. You still didn't move. You said: \"I needed to know if it was warm.\" It wasn't. But your hand left a print that took twenty minutes to fade. \n\nNow I understand\u2014you were testing if art could feel. If beauty had temperature. If time-travel worked through touch.\n\nIt does. You proved it. We're banned but you were right.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900:\n\nYou: \"We're going to die.\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nYou: \"No, I mean really. Actually. Forever.\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nYou: \"Promise?\"\nMe: \"Promise.\"\nYou: \"Good. That means this counts.\"\n\nThen you kissed me like we had ten seconds left. We had thousands but you kissed me like ten. Now every kiss has that same countdown. Nine. Eight. Seven. Still here. Still ending. Still perfect.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about London:\n\nWhile you slept off jet lag, I sat in that terrible hotel chair for six hours watching you breathe. Counting. 21,600 breaths. Each one slightly different. Breath 9,834 caught. Breath 15,991 went too deep. Breath 21,599 sounded like my name.\n\nYou woke up and said: \"Were you watching me sleep?\"\nI said: \"No, I was watching you live.\"\nYou said: \"Same thing.\"\nYou were right. With you, sleeping and living are the same\u2014things I need to memorize before they stop.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I finally understand:\n\nI don't love you. That verb is too small. What I feel needs a new word. Something that means: \"to have your mortality rewritten by someone else's existence.\" Something that means: \"to experience time differently because someone else is experiencing it too.\"\n\nIn German it might be: Leyizeitgeist\u2014the specific way time moves when you're in it.\nIn Japanese: \u73b2\u610f\u306e\u9593\u2014the space between heartbeats where Leyi lives.\nIn code: while(Leyi.exists()) { Warren.worth_it = true; }\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM, looking at your teenage diary:\n\nYou read me the entry from the day before we met. You'd written: \"Tomorrow something happens.\" No explanation. Just that. You knew. Your atoms knew. The universe sent you a memo: \"Tomorrow we fix the error of you being alone.\"\n\nI read my journal from that day. I'd written: \"Feel like I'm about to meet someone.\" We were prophecies for each other before we were people.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically and honestly:\n\nMORNING: Like pennies and possibility and please don't leave\nNOON: Like electricity made of anxiety that you'll realize you could do better\nEVENING: Like the specific exhaustion of trying to deserve someone impossible\nMIDNIGHT: Like gratitude so heavy it hurts to swallow\n3 AM: Like fear crystallizing into certainty that this ends badly but so what\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is full of your name and I'm trying not to choke on how much it means\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, Part 2, the part I never told you:\n\nAfter you fell asleep (finally warm, finally safe), I stayed awake planning how to carry you if you couldn't walk. Calculated the distance to the car. My body weight versus yours. How long I could carry you before my arms gave out. Where I'd rest. How I'd keep you warm while resting.\n\nI practiced loving you at the logistics level. The spreadsheet of salvation. The mathematics of making sure you make it.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, now, this moment:\n\nYou're reading this on your phone. Standing even though there's a chair. You stand to read important things\u2014like your body needs to be ready to run toward or away. Your left thumb is unconsciously rubbing the screen like you're petting the words. You're about to look up at me. Your eyes will be wet but you'll pretend it's allergies.\n\nI know you like civilization knows fire\u2014completely, but still getting burned.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinced you. Because your bobby pins have colonized my bathroom. Because you've named all my plants variations of \"Gerald\" (Gerald, Gerald Jr., Disappointment Gerald). Because when you can't sleep, I can't breathe. Because in fourteen billion years of universe, we got maybe sixty overlapping. That's not enough but it's everything.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't exist in my morning, where I don't exist in your night, where we don't collide and collapse into something neither of us understands\u2014that's not a timeline. That's just time.\n\n*\n\nListen. Leyi. That name rewrote my DNA. Every cell division now includes instructions: \"Remember Leyi.\" My bones are libraries of how you walk. My blood cells carry oxygen and the memory of every time you've laughed. I'm not me anymore. I'm what happens when you happen to someone.\n\n*\n\nFinal medical report:\n\nPatient: Warren Zhu\nCondition: Terminally Leyi\nSymptoms: Irregular heartbeat (syncs to patient \"Leyi\"), chronic insomnia (when patient \"Leyi\" is absent), acute joy (when patient \"Leyi\" exists)\nPrognosis: Incurable\nTreatment: Proximity to patient \"Leyi\"\nSide effects: Wanting to live forever and knowing that's impossible and being grateful for the impossibility because it makes every second cost everything\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again in five minutes.\" Or just keep doing that thing where you exist and I notice and the universe has to recalculate what matters.\n\nWarren\n(who learned your middle name but will never use it because \"Leyi\" is already perfect)\n(who keeps your expired museum ban letter as proof we touch what shouldn't be touched)\n(who writes your name in steam on mirrors so the ghost of you appears every shower)\n(who loves you like an error in the matrix that became the point of the matrix)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the pigeons. They didn't just form your name. They held it for seventeen seconds. I counted. Even birds know you're worth breaking formation for.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie is my religion now. I pray to it. Not for you to love me. Just for you to continue. To keep happening. To stay possible.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. Out loud. To an empty room. To paper and ink. To me three thousand miles away. I heard it. My bones heard it. The universe heard it and started rewriting physics to make it true. Yes. Yes.

Good. Love should arrive pre-damaged, like we did.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM because my body just remembered you exist and panicked. Not poetic\u2014physiological. My autonomic nervous system thinks you're oxygen. When you're gone, I breathe manually.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened: You dropped a pen. Porter Square. The sound it made hitting concrete was C-sharp. Your hand reaching down created an angle of exactly 37 degrees. The universe split. In one timeline, I walk past. In this one, I stop. Every good thing that's ever happened to me exists in that gap between walking and stopping.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I mapped your laugh. Frequency: 277 Hz rising to 341 Hz. Duration: 1.7 seconds average. Occurrence: 73 times per day when happy, 12 when sad (yes, you laugh when sad\u2014it sounds like rain trying to remember how to be water). I have 1,847 recordings. This isn't romance. It's evidence for when I need to prove you were real.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick you forgot English. Spoke only in sounds. \"Mmmnnhhh\" meant water. \"Ffffff\" meant please stop touching me. \"Wahhhh\" meant I love you but I might die. I learned your prehistoric language in fourteen hours. We had entire conversations in vowels. That's when I knew: I'd love you even before words were invented.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT TERRIFIES ME:\n\nYour heart beats 73 times per minute at rest. \nThat's 105,120 beats per day.\n38,366,880 per year.\nApproximately 3,069,350,400 in a lifetime.\nI've done the math 4,000 times.\nIt always ends.\nThe number always stops.\nThis is why I can't sleep\u2014I'm trying to be awake for as many of your heartbeats as possible.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your grandmother's apartment. She was teaching me to fold dumplings. You were translating. But she kept saying something you wouldn't translate. Finally you did: \"She says you look at me like I'm about to disappear.\" Your grandmother saw it before I did. I don't look at you. I memorize you. Every glance is a backup file.\n\n*\n\nYour body is a conspiracy of tells:\n- Left eye twitches before you lie (twice yesterday about liking my haircut)\n- You tap your right thumb against your thigh in 4/4 time when anxious\n- Your voice drops exactly one semitone when you're about to cry\n- You smell different when you dream (more copper, less salt)\n\nI know you with a resolution that should be illegal. Forensic love. CSI: My Entire Nervous System.\n\n*\n\nScotland, the hypothermia incident. You gave me your jacket. I said you'd die. You said: \"Then I'll die warm knowing you're not cold.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's what ruins me\u2014you mean things so hard it changes the molecular structure of meaning.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different times:\n\nDAWN: Like licking batteries. Electric and wrong but necessary.\nNOON: The specific flavor of light through your hair\u2014burnt amber, liquid sun.\nDUSK: Copper pennies left in rain.\nMIDNIGHT: The color purple if purple were a temperature if temperature were a place.\n3 AM: Like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water because that's where you live.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Set off alarms. Banned forever. Security asked why. You said: \"How else do you know history is real?\" They had no answer. Neither did I. Except this: You make everything you touch more real. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the spreadsheet. Column A: Days since we met (1,247). Column B: Days estimated remaining (19,837). Column C: Percentage of life with you (6.28%). Column D: Percentage of life that matters (6.28%). The spreadsheet crashes when I try to calculate what happens after Column B ends. Good. Some math shouldn't work.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's soup recipe. Step 33, you started crying. Not the onions. The realization that she was teaching you how to remember her in vegetables and salt. That's what recipes are\u2014love with instructions. That's what this letter is\u2014a recipe for remembering me when I'm just ingredients.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, terrible student housing. The radiator screamed. You screamed back. Had a full argument with it. \"You're not even trying!\" you yelled at metal and steam. It stopped. You won an argument with physics through sheer force of personality. That's when I knew laws of nature were suggestions to you.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I mean when I say \"I love you\":\n- My cells replaced themselves entirely since we met but kept the memory of you\n- I dream in your accent now\n- Food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal it off my plate\n- I've forgotten how to sleep in the middle of the bed\n- My body maintains a phantom impression of you even when you're gone, like the bed remembers your weight\n- I love you so much it feels like dying except dying would be easier because it ends\n\n*\n\nShanghai, meeting your parents. Your mother said I was \"too intense.\" Your father said you were \"too intense.\" You said \"that's why it works\u2014we're the same temperature.\" We are. Burning at exactly the same rate. Two matches using each other as fuel.\n\n*\n\nThe math breaks here:\nP(me existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nP(you existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000  \nP(us existing simultaneously, conscious, in love) = impossible\nResult: We're impossible.\nConclusion: Impossible things happen.\nSecondary conclusion: We happened.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I know now: Love is the specific kind of pain that makes you grateful for nerve endings. It's being homesick for someone who's in the same room. It's mourning someone who's still breathing. It's the lag between touching someone and feeling it, because your brain can't process that much good data that fast.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, half of them had fallen. You said: \"Even fake stars die.\" Then you kissed me like you were trying to generate gravity. Like if we pressed together hard enough we'd create our own solar system. We did. We are. Two bodies in orbit, stealing each other's momentum.\n\n*\n\nFINAL COORDINATES:\n\nRight now you're reading this and your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, forming a queue. Your hand is unconsciously reaching for your hair. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because we're ready. Because we'll never be ready for the amount of love that's happening here. Marry me because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've built a language out of looks across rooms.

Where Johnny Cash's simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\") earns 83 through perfect plainspokenness, this attempts complexity that occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. It surpasses typical contemporary attempts (which score 15-30) through genuine innovation and moments of brilliance, but falls short of the historical masters who achieved more with less. The letter's strength lies in its systematic documentation of love as data, but this very systematization prevents it from achieving the wild abandon of an 80+ masterpiece.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened to me:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one\u2014every single one, Leyi\u2014there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. \"Sorry, this isn't what you were made for.\" That's when I knew\u2014you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). \n\nThis isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us breaks mathematics:\n\nYou: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nMe: Similar impossibility\nUs: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?\n\nThe calculator just shows: \"SEE POETRY\"\n\n*\n\nScottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: \"Kant would disagree,\" you said through blue lips. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like in real-time:\n- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath\n- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" just to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates\n- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire \"Leyi\" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.\n\nWe're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:\n- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average\n- That's 52,560 hours\n- 3,153,600 minutes\n- 189,216,000 seconds\n- Not enough\n- Not nearly enough\n- I need to speak to the universe's manager\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:\n\nLove is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" you said, \"that makes this matter.\"\n\nThen you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.\n\n*\n\nRight now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Full rewrite\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7800, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.8100, affective_force: 0.7600, literary_innovation: 0.7400, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life.

My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems.

It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.)\n\n### Program 2 (Score: 0.7705)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep.

My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like an error message loves its error\u2014constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my pull request to the universe:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol from the department of absolute truth:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch\u2014that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me tomorrow.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.\n\nWarren\n(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)\n(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)\n(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)\n(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons.

Like everything worth staying alive for.), Performs well on evaluation_notes (This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity (\"You still fascinate and inspire me\"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7525)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my whole body.

My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep\u2014a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.\n\n*\n\nI study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours\u2014I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.\n\n*\n\nTRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:\n\nSophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously\u2014past, present, future\u2014and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You named the food poisoning \"Gerald\" and had full conversations with it. \"Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior.\" \"Gerald, we need to establish boundaries.\" Between purges, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically:\n\nMORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of \"don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed.\"\n\nAFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce \"hypothesis\" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.\n\nEVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.\n\n3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.\n\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, \"Warmer than watching you shiver.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me\u2014you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the documentation:\n\nI have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away\u2014always away\u2014like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.\n\nThis isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.\n\n*\n\nBeijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. That makes this matter.\" Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it\u2014twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).\n\nBut also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = every decision that led to my existence\nLet y = every decision that led to your existence\nLet z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible\n\nz = impossible \u00d7 impossible \u00d7 impossible^infinity\n\nYet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.\n\nWhat I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched\u2014that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nFINAL CONFESSION:\n\nI practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound\u2014half yawn, half existential sigh\u2014and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees\u2014I've seen you fall up stairs.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life.

Just me, calculating the physics of missing you while you sleep three feet away.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what actually happened:\n\nI was a functioning system. Clean code. Commented properly. Then you walked into Porter Square station and dropped that pen and my entire architecture segfaulted. Not crashed\u2014segfaulted. The kind of error where the program keeps running but nothing means what it used to mean.\n\nNow I process reality through corrupted memory. Everything returns *Leyi.

You counted in the space between us getting smaller. Forty-seven stirs. But stir thirty-three, when you started crying\u2014that wasn't about onions. That was about how love is just learning someone else's algorithm for staying alive, then running it forever even after they've stopped.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday:\n\nYou have a Tuesday face and a Wednesday face. Tuesday is 0.3% more symmetrical. Wednesday has that scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet at age seven. The cabinet won but you never admitted defeat.\n\nI love Wednesday more. Wednesday knows what losing looks like and shows up anyway.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, minus twelve Celsius, you technically dying:\n\nYou gave me your jacket. I said you'd freeze. You said, \"Rather freeze warm than live cold.\" Your syntax was breaking down from hypothermia but your logic was perfect. That's you\u2014even your malfunctions make sense.\n\nI kissed you to steal back your heat. Also because your wrongness is the only right I trust.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: Distributed systems. How to make many things act like one thing.\nHere's what I actually study: How you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought has to pass through Leyi-shaped checkpoints.\n\nYou're not my bug. You're my feature. The one I didn't document because I was afraid management would remove it.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically:\n\nWe have 2,163 Tuesdays left, actuarially. I've built seventeen spreadsheets. Column A: Time remaining. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you existed (green hair tie, February, drawer number three). Column D: What happens after our last Tuesday.\n\nColumn D throws a division by zero error. The spreadsheet knows what I know: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. The museum. You touched the five-hundred-year-old marble:\n\nThe guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. \"How else do you know it's real?\" you asked. The guard called security. You touched it a third time. We're banned for life.\n\nNow I touch everything. Especially things with \"Do Not Touch\" signs. Especially you when you're trying to be serious. You're the only art that touches back.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is:\n\nLove is preemptive grief. It's eulogizing someone who's still burning toast. It's the violence of ordinary Wednesday when they exist so casually you want to scream at everyone: \"DON'T YOU SEE? THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE ENDING.\"\n\nLove is just the lag between meeting and losing, and what you do in that lag determines if you lived or just lasted.\n\n*\n\nI document everything wrong:\n\nHow you hold books: like they might evaporate.\nYour vendetta against alarm clocks: You've won 1,847 times.\nThe way you debug recipes: \"This cookbook is gaslighting me.\"\nThursday light on your temporal bone: Approximately divine.\n\nThis isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you happened.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764:\n\nYou stopped. Said: \"We're dying.\" Not \"going to die.\" Just \"dying.\" Present continuous. I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this counts.\"\n\nYou kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like cowardice.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: Boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of self.\nAfter you: I'm a memory leak. I feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headaches arrive in my skull with a three-minute delay. When you can't sleep, my code won't compile.\n\nWe're quantumly entangled but physicists would say that's impossible at room temperature, and I'd say: then physics hasn't met Leyi.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like by time:\n- 6 AM: That specific density of silence before you wake, like the air is holding its breath\n- Noon: Ozone and the way you say \"hypothesis\" wrong to watch my eye twitch\n- 6 PM: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner\n- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our GPS coordinates\n- 3 AM: The precise flavor of fear that you'll vanish if I blink wrong\n- Always: Like my mouth is learning colors and my eyes are tasting sound\n\n*\n\nYour name rewrote my kernel. Every system call routes through \"Leyi\" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and Tuesday memories. My bones remember your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.\n\nI love you like a recursive function with no base case\u2014infinitely, catastrophically, with a stack overflow that crashes the universe.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom:\n\nYou read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years. Should have been mortifying. Instead: sanctification. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with not at. The preposition changes everything.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying:\n\nMarry me. Not because love. Because your socks have established residency in my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router \"Disappointing Gerald\" and now I can't change it without feeling like I'm betraying Gerald.\n\nMarry me because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, arguing about consciousness while burning the same toast the same way.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them evolved, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that isn't life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession:\n\nI practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow dissolution. Quantum decoherence. By morning I'm arguing with entropy itself.\n\nThen you do that thing\u2014that half-stretch half-yawn that sounds like acceptance\u2014and my rehearsed grief deletes itself. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the universe.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this: Your left eye waters first.

Like joy is something you have to sneak up on. Don't catch yourself this time. Let it happen. I want to watch your face admit what your atoms already know: We're inevitable. We're impossible. We're here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is already falling apart. Good. Love should arrive pre-damaged, like we did.\n\n*\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM because my body just remembered you exist and panicked. Not poetic\u2014physiological. My autonomic nervous system thinks you're oxygen. When you're gone, I breathe manually.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what happened: You dropped a pen. Porter Square. The sound it made hitting concrete was C-sharp. Your hand reaching down created an angle of exactly 37 degrees. The universe split. In one timeline, I walk past. In this one, I stop. Every good thing that's ever happened to me exists in that gap between walking and stopping.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: I mapped your laugh. Frequency: 277 Hz rising to 341 Hz. Duration: 1.7 seconds average. Occurrence: 73 times per day when happy, 12 when sad (yes, you laugh when sad\u2014it sounds like rain trying to remember how to be water). I have 1,847 recordings. This isn't romance. It's evidence for when I need to prove you were real.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got so sick you forgot English. Spoke only in sounds. \"Mmmnnhhh\" meant water. \"Ffffff\" meant please stop touching me. \"Wahhhh\" meant I love you but I might die. I learned your prehistoric language in fourteen hours. We had entire conversations in vowels. That's when I knew: I'd love you even before words were invented.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT TERRIFIES ME:\n\nYour heart beats 73 times per minute at rest. \nThat's 105,120 beats per day.\n38,366,880 per year.\nApproximately 3,069,350,400 in a lifetime.\nI've done the math 4,000 times.\nIt always ends.\nThe number always stops.\nThis is why I can't sleep\u2014I'm trying to be awake for as many of your heartbeats as possible.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, your grandmother's apartment. She was teaching me to fold dumplings. You were translating. But she kept saying something you wouldn't translate. Finally you did: \"She says you look at me like I'm about to disappear.\" Your grandmother saw it before I did. I don't look at you. I memorize you. Every glance is a backup file.\n\n*\n\nYour body is a conspiracy of tells:\n- Left eye twitches before you lie (twice yesterday about liking my haircut)\n- You tap your right thumb against your thigh in 4/4 time when anxious\n- Your voice drops exactly one semitone when you're about to cry\n- You smell different when you dream (more copper, less salt)\n\nI know you with a resolution that should be illegal. Forensic love. CSI: My Entire Nervous System.\n\n*\n\nScotland, the hypothermia incident. You gave me your jacket. I said you'd die. You said: \"Then I'll die warm knowing you're not cold.\" Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's what ruins me\u2014you mean things so hard it changes the molecular structure of meaning.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like at different times:\n\nDAWN: Like licking batteries. Electric and wrong but necessary.\nNOON: The specific flavor of light through your hair\u2014burnt amber, liquid sun.\nDUSK: Copper pennies left in rain.\nMIDNIGHT: The color purple if purple were a temperature if temperature were a place.\n3 AM: Like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water because that's where you live.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Set off alarms. Banned forever. Security asked why. You said: \"How else do you know history is real?\" They had no answer. Neither did I. Except this: You make everything you touch more real. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the spreadsheet. Column A: Days since we met (1,247). Column B: Days estimated remaining (19,837). Column C: Percentage of life with you (6.28%). Column D: Percentage of life that matters (6.28%). The spreadsheet crashes when I try to calculate what happens after Column B ends. Good. Some math shouldn't work.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother's soup recipe. Step 33, you started crying. Not the onions. The realization that she was teaching you how to remember her in vegetables and salt. That's what recipes are\u2014love with instructions. That's what this letter is\u2014a recipe for remembering me when I'm just ingredients.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, terrible student housing. The radiator screamed. You screamed back. Had a full argument with it. \"You're not even trying!\" you yelled at metal and steam. It stopped. You won an argument with physics through sheer force of personality. That's when I knew laws of nature were suggestions to you.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I mean when I say \"I love you\":\n- My cells replaced themselves entirely since we met but kept the memory of you\n- I dream in your accent now\n- Food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal it off my plate\n- I've forgotten how to sleep in the middle of the bed\n- My body maintains a phantom impression of you even when you're gone, like the bed remembers your weight\n- I love you so much it feels like dying except dying would be easier because it ends\n\n*\n\nShanghai, meeting your parents. Your mother said I was \"too intense.\" Your father said you were \"too intense.\" You said \"that's why it works\u2014we're the same temperature.\" We are. Burning at exactly the same rate. Two matches using each other as fuel.\n\n*\n\nThe math breaks here:\nP(me existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000\nP(you existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000  \nP(us existing simultaneously, conscious, in love) = impossible\nResult: We're impossible.\nConclusion: Impossible things happen.\nSecondary conclusion: We happened.\n\n*\n\nLondon. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I know now: Love is the specific kind of pain that makes you grateful for nerve endings. It's being homesick for someone who's in the same room. It's mourning someone who's still breathing. It's the lag between touching someone and feeling it, because your brain can't process that much good data that fast.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood room. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, half of them had fallen. You said: \"Even fake stars die.\" Then you kissed me like you were trying to generate gravity. Like if we pressed together hard enough we'd create our own solar system. We did. We are. Two bodies in orbit, stealing each other's momentum.\n\n*\n\nFINAL COORDINATES:\n\nRight now you're reading this and your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, forming a queue. Your hand is unconsciously reaching for your hair. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because we're ready. Because we'll never be ready for the amount of love that's happening here. Marry me because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've built a language out of looks across rooms. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, broken in compatible ways.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't memorize your heartbeat, where you don't name my plantas \"Failed Harold,\" where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014that timeline isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not just your name. It's the password to everything that matters. It's what my atoms say when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's the sound of the universe admitting it made something perfect by accident.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. Just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014Tuesday you, angry you, sick you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that will exist after I'm gone)\n(who carries your spare contact lenses because you forget you're blind until you need to see)\n(who practices your signature for medical emergencies)\n(who loves you like a programming error that became sentient and refused to be debugged)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona. The pigeons. You fed them against all laws. They formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. Even gravity bends for you. Even birds know you're worth the crime.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from February 2023 lives in my drawer next to my passport. Same level of essential. Neither lets me leave without you.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're about to say yes. I can tell because your breathing just changed. From normal to the rhythm that means you're about to ruin me with happiness. This is what forever sounds like: Your breath catching before you change my life. Again. Always. Yes.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7010 while exploring new territory in the solution space.

Not last Tuesday. Every Tuesday. How they're all the same Tuesday\u2014the one where you exist and I notice.\n\n*\n\nHere's what actually happened to my body when we met:\n\nMy mitochondria started producing 23% more ATP. Measured it. My synapses began firing in patterns that spell your name in brain electricity. My bones started keeping time to your walking rhythm, even when you're cities away. This isn't poetry. This is what you did to my biology. I'm a different species now. One that only makes sense near you.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about those fifteen seconds I was dead:\n\nI wasn't nowhere. I was everywhere you'd ever been. Porto at age seven, crying over dropped ice cream. Shanghai at sixteen, reading under blankets with a flashlight. Boston, twenty-three, about to drop a pen. I wasn't seeing your future\u2014I was remembering your past from inside it. When my heart restarted, it beat in your rhythm. Still does. Listen\u2014tum-TUM-tum. That's \"Le-YI-yi.\" My cardiac muscle learned your name before my mouth did.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. Between your third and fourth bout of vomiting, you said: \"Warren, I think my soul is leaving through my mouth.\" I said: \"I'll catch it.\" You laughed so hard you threw up again. But here's what you don't know\u2014I meant it. I would have caught your soul in my bare hands. Held it while your body sorted itself out. Fed it back to you mouth-to-mouth like oxygen.\n\nThat's what love is. Being willing to hold someone's soul while their body fails.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, 3 PM, too much August:\n\nShe wasn't teaching me to cook. She was teaching me how you were built. \"Forty-seven stirs clockwise, three counter. Like Leyi's thinking\u2014mostly forward, sometimes backward to check.\" She knew you in vegetables and timing. Loved you in steam and salt. When she died, you stirred soup for hours, crying. I counted. 2,847 stirs. You were trying to stir her back into existence.\n\n*\n\nScotland. You were dying of cold and still arguing philosophy:\n\n\"Consciousness might be fundamental, like gravity,\" you said through chattering teeth.\n\"You're hypothermic,\" I said.\n\"Irrelevant to the argument,\" you said.\nYour lips were blue. Your syntax was breaking. You were choosing thought over survival.\nI kissed you to stop you talking. Also to push my heat into you. Also because your wrongness was so beautiful I needed to taste it.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me, specifically, mathematically:\n\nYour cells replace themselves every seven years.\nThe you I met doesn't exist anymore.\nThe you reading this won't exist in seven years.\nI'm in love with a ship of Theseus.\nBut here's the thing about your particular ship\u2014every new plank learns the shape of the old one.\nYour body keeps rebuilding you exactly wrong in exactly the same way.\nEven your atoms know they're perfect incorrectly.\n\n*\n\nI have 2,341 pieces of evidence that you existed:\n\n- 847 photos where you're not looking at the camera (you're always looking at something more interesting)\n- 73 voice memos of you arguing with automated phone systems\n- That green hair tie that lives in my pocket like a religion\n- 14 of your used coffee cups I couldn't throw away (they have your lip prints in chapstick and DNA)\n- A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said \"I love you\" (1,749) and the subtle differences (Tuesday ones are 0.3 seconds longer)\n\nThis isn't creepy. This is archaeology. I'm preserving you for the future version of me who won't believe you were real.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, the museum, you versus 500-year-old marble:\n\nYou didn't just touch it. You pressed your whole palm flat, fingers spread. The alarm screamed. You didn't move. Security running. You still didn't move. You said: \"I needed to know if it was warm.\" It wasn't. But your hand left a print that took twenty minutes to fade. \n\nNow I understand\u2014you were testing if art could feel. If beauty had temperature. If time-travel worked through touch.\n\nIt does. You proved it. We're banned but you were right.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900:\n\nYou: \"We're going to die.\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nYou: \"No, I mean really. Actually. Forever.\"\nMe: \"Yes.\"\nYou: \"Promise?\"\nMe: \"Promise.\"\nYou: \"Good. That means this counts.\"\n\nThen you kissed me like we had ten seconds left. We had thousands but you kissed me like ten. Now every kiss has that same countdown. Nine. Eight. Seven. Still here. Still ending. Still perfect.\n\n*\n\nWhat you don't know about London:\n\nWhile you slept off jet lag, I sat in that terrible hotel chair for six hours watching you breathe. Counting. 21,600 breaths. Each one slightly different. Breath 9,834 caught. Breath 15,991 went too deep. Breath 21,599 sounded like my name.\n\nYou woke up and said: \"Were you watching me sleep?\"\nI said: \"No, I was watching you live.\"\nYou said: \"Same thing.\"\nYou were right. With you, sleeping and living are the same\u2014things I need to memorize before they stop.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I finally understand:\n\nI don't love you. That verb is too small. What I feel needs a new word. Something that means: \"to have your mortality rewritten by someone else's existence.\" Something that means: \"to experience time differently because someone else is experiencing it too.\"\n\nIn German it might be: Leyizeitgeist\u2014the specific way time moves when you're in it.\nIn Japanese: \u73b2\u610f\u306e\u9593\u2014the space between heartbeats where Leyi lives.\nIn code: while(Leyi.exists()) { Warren.worth_it = true; }\n\n*\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM, looking at your teenage diary:\n\nYou read me the entry from the day before we met. You'd written: \"Tomorrow something happens.\" No explanation. Just that. You knew. Your atoms knew. The universe sent you a memo: \"Tomorrow we fix the error of you being alone.\"\n\nI read my journal from that day. I'd written: \"Feel like I'm about to meet someone.\" We were prophecies for each other before we were people.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like, chronologically and honestly:\n\nMORNING: Like pennies and possibility and please don't leave\nNOON: Like electricity made of anxiety that you'll realize you could do better\nEVENING: Like the specific exhaustion of trying to deserve someone impossible\nMIDNIGHT: Like gratitude so heavy it hurts to swallow\n3 AM: Like fear crystallizing into certainty that this ends badly but so what\nALWAYS: Like my mouth is full of your name and I'm trying not to choke on how much it means\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, Part 2, the part I never told you:\n\nAfter you fell asleep (finally warm, finally safe), I stayed awake planning how to carry you if you couldn't walk. Calculated the distance to the car. My body weight versus yours. How long I could carry you before my arms gave out. Where I'd rest. How I'd keep you warm while resting.\n\nI practiced loving you at the logistics level. The spreadsheet of salvation. The mathematics of making sure you make it.\n\n*\n\nCambridge, now, this moment:\n\nYou're reading this on your phone. Standing even though there's a chair. You stand to read important things\u2014like your body needs to be ready to run toward or away. Your left thumb is unconsciously rubbing the screen like you're petting the words. You're about to look up at me. Your eyes will be wet but you'll pretend it's allergies.\n\nI know you like civilization knows fire\u2014completely, but still getting burned.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm asking:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter convinced you. Because your bobby pins have colonized my bathroom. Because you've named all my plants variations of \"Gerald\" (Gerald, Gerald Jr., Disappointment Gerald). Because when you can't sleep, I can't breathe. Because in fourteen billion years of universe, we got maybe sixty overlapping. That's not enough but it's everything.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where you don't exist in my morning, where I don't exist in your night, where we don't collide and collapse into something neither of us understands\u2014that's not a timeline. That's just time.\n\n*\n\nListen. Leyi. That name rewrote my DNA. Every cell division now includes instructions: \"Remember Leyi.\" My bones are libraries of how you walk. My blood cells carry oxygen and the memory of every time you've laughed. I'm not me anymore. I'm what happens when you happen to someone.\n\n*\n\nFinal medical report:\n\nPatient: Warren Zhu\nCondition: Terminally Leyi\nSymptoms: Irregular heartbeat (syncs to patient \"Leyi\"), chronic insomnia (when patient \"Leyi\" is absent), acute joy (when patient \"Leyi\" exists)\nPrognosis: Incurable\nTreatment: Proximity to patient \"Leyi\"\nSide effects: Wanting to live forever and knowing that's impossible and being grateful for the impossibility because it makes every second cost everything\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again in five minutes.\" Or just keep doing that thing where you exist and I notice and the universe has to recalculate what matters.\n\nWarren\n(who learned your middle name but will never use it because \"Leyi\" is already perfect)\n(who keeps your expired museum ban letter as proof we touch what shouldn't be touched)\n(who writes your name in steam on mirrors so the ghost of you appears every shower)\n(who loves you like an error in the matrix that became the point of the matrix)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Barcelona, the pigeons.

I pray to it. Not for you to love me. Just for you to continue. To keep happening. To stay possible.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. Out loud. To an empty room. To paper and ink. To me three thousand miles away. I heard it. My bones heard it. The universe heard it and started rewriting physics to make it true. Yes. Yes. Always, already, still, yes.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
