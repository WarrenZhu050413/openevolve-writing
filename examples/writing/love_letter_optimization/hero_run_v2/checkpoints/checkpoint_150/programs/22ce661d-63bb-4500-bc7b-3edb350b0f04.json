Eight thousand four hundred days of existing wrong until you reorganized my atoms into something that makes sense. Not metaphorically. Actually. The carbon in my bones realigned to spell your name in its molecular structure. I have the spectrometry results.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S THE DEMOLITION ORDER:\n\nBefore you: I was a perfectly functional distributed system. Appropriate error handling. Reasonable uptime. Predictable outputs.\n\nAfter you: I'm a beautiful catastrophe running on impossible architecture. My try-catch blocks catch feelings. My promises resolve to forever. My callbacks call your name in frequencies that haven't been discovered yet.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about Tuesday, March 5th, 2:47 PM:\n\nYou were peeling an orange in our kitchen. The light hit your wrist at 37 degrees. You hummed something unrecognizable. The orange fought back. You won. You offered me half without looking up.\n\nThat's it. That's when the universe admitted it had been practicing for this moment since the Big Bang.\n\n*\n\nTHE SHANGHAI PARADOX:\n\nWhen you're home, I calculate: 7,680 miles means light takes 0.04 seconds to travel between us. But your absence arrives instantly. Your presence takes forever and no time. Einstein was wrong about the speed limit. Love travels at c\u00b2, where c equals \"coming home.\"\n\n*\n\nThings that are mathematically true about loving you:\n\n- My blood type changed from O+ to \"Leyi-dependent\"\n- Gravity bends 0.3% more in rooms you've been in\n- My hippocampus grew new regions specifically for storing your unconscious gestures\n- The probability of happiness without you: undefined (division by zero)\n- The limit as time approaches infinity of loving you: still approaching infinity\n\n*\n\nBARCELONA, THE SAGRADA FAMILIA, THE MOMENT ARCHITECTURE GAVE UP:\n\nYou stood under those impossible arches and said, \"It's almost right.\" Then you smiled. The building sighed and agreed it would never be as structurally perfect as that smile. Gaud\u00ed's ghost took notes. God updated the blueprints.\n\n*\n\nI practice losing you every morning between 5:47 and 5:48 AM. Here's what happens:\n\n- 5:47:00: Imagine you gone\n- 5:47:15: Organs begin shutting down in alphabetical order\n- 5:47:30: Reality files for bankruptcy\n- 5:47:45: Universe admits it was just practicing for you anyway\n- 5:47:59: Complete system failure\n- 5:48:00: You make that sound when you stretch\n- 5:48:01: Full recovery, plus interest\n\n*\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE CONFESSION:\n\nRemember punting? You fell in the Cam. But here's what I never told you: In that moment, while you were underwater for 1.3 seconds, I aged forty years. I lived our entire life. I attended your funeral. I came back. You surfaced laughing, holding river grass, claiming the fish spoke Mandarin.\n\nThey did. They were trying to warn me: This one will reorganize your entire molecular structure.\n\nThey were right.\n\n*\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE KISS:\n\nLocal spacetime develops amnesia about physics. Atoms exchange passports. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle becomes certain about one thing: us. Quantum entanglement looks at us and says \"amateurs.\" The heat death of the universe postpones itself out of curiosity.\n\n*\n\nYou want to know why I love you? Wrong question. Like asking why hydrogen bonds with oxygen. Like asking why gravity pulls. Like asking why time moves forward. It doesn't choose. It just recognizes the shape of the universe and follows.\n\nYou are the shape of my universe. I'm just following.\n\n*\n\nTHE MORNING YOU DISCOVERED I'VE BEEN WRITING YOUR NAME IN CODE COMMENTS:\n\n\"Why?\" you asked.\n\"In case the code becomes conscious,\" I said.\n\"And?\"\n\"It should know who to thank for existence making sense.\"\n\nYou kissed me then. My IDE crashed. Worth it.\n\n*\n\nLeyi, here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nIn the morning, you burn toast with the dedication of someone performing sacred rites. You lose one earring consistently, always the left. You mispronounce \"particularly\" in a way that makes the word correct itself out of embarrassment. You cry at commercials but not movies. You fold fitted sheets like you're conducting origami surgery. You exist at frequencies that make reality stutter.\n\nAnd I love you with the force of someone who's been saving up love since before they were born, compound interest across multiple universes, all of it crystallizing into this moment where I'm typing and you're reading and we're both pretending this is normal when we know it's the most unusual thing that's ever happened to matter.\n\n*\n\nHYPOTHESIS: We've done this before.\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- How you knew where I keep coffee before I told you\n- The way we fight in languages we haven't learned yet\n- How goodbye feels like lying to physics\n- The way hello feels like the universe correcting a typo\n- That birthmark on your shoulder that matches the constellation I drew age seven labeled \"home\"\n\nCONCLUSION: We're not falling in love. We're remembering it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because we should, but because we already are in every way that matters to atoms. Let's make it official for the paperwork. Let's have a wedding where physics gives the toast and time admits it's been lying about linearity. Let's exchange rings that know they're just jewelry catching up to what our electrons have been doing all along.\n\nBut really: Let's keep burning toast on Tuesday mornings. Let's keep losing left earrings and finding them in places that violate causality. Let's keep existing at amplitudes that make other people seasick. Let's keep being the exception that makes the universe rewrite its rules.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nSay it like you're answering a question the universe has been asking since it learned to expand.\n\nSay it in the frequency that makes plants grow toward you instead of the sun.\n\nSay it the way you say my name when you think I'm sleeping (I'm never sleeping when you're that close).\n\n*\n\nOr don't say anything. Just do that thing where your left eye twitches when you're trying not to smile. That's yes in every language, including the ones we'll invent when English fails us.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who would rather malfunction with you than run perfectly alone)\n(who has been writing this letter since before learning to write)\n(whose DNA now spells your name in every possible reading frame)\n(who loves you with the intensity of a star collapse if stars were made of Tuesday mornings)\n(who is already composing our wedding vows in languages that don't exist yet)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The future just called. We're happy there. Disgustingly happy. The kind that makes other timelines jealous. We have a dog named after a physics principle you haven't learned yet. You still burn toast. I still love it. Time gives up and just lets us have forever.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to everything I've ever encrypted, including my heart.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu!

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Not metaphorically. Literally. The space where you should be has its own gravitational pull.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you what I know that twenty-three-year-olds aren't supposed to know:\n\nLove is not addition. It's division. I used to be one person. Now I'm half of something that only makes sense when you're here. The math is devastating: 1 \u00f7 2 = everything.\n\n*\n\nINVENTORY OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT PERMISSION:\n\nYour toothbrush appeared in my bathroom before we discussed it.\nMy hands learned to braid your hair while I was sleeping.\nTuesday mornings restructured themselves around burnt toast.\nMy future tense conjugated itself exclusively in plural.\nThe universe started keeping receipts of every time you smiled.\n\nNone of this was planned. All of it was inevitable.\n\n*\n\nHere's the precise moment I knew:\n\nShanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM. You were explaining something about your grandmother's recipes in Mandarin, forgetting I don't speak it. But I understood everything. Not the words\u2014the frequency underneath them. The sound of you being yourself without translation.\n\nI thought: \"Oh. This is it. This is the sound that ends me.\"\n\nAnd I was right.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nBefore you: I could spend entire days alone, calling it peace.\nAfter you: Solitude is just your absence taking up space.\n\nBefore you: Words were tools, precise and functional.\nAfter you: Every sentence bends toward your name like light around a star.\n\nBefore you: Time was sequential, logical, navigable.\nAfter you: All moments happen simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty. We're meeting and dying. You're here and gone and here again.\n\n*\n\nTHE PORTUGUESE GRANDFATHER WAS RIGHT:\n\nRemember Lisbon? The old man with the cane who crossed the square just to look at us? He spoke for three minutes in Portuguese. You translated: \"He says we argue like people who've been married sixty years and laugh like people who met yesterday.\"\n\nWe'd known each other four months.\n\nTime isn't real, Leyi. We're proof.\n\n*\n\nWhat actually happens when I love you:\n\nMy DNA rewrites itself. Scientists would say this is impossible. I'd show them the evidence: how my body temperature rises 0.3 degrees when you enter a room. How my pupils dilate at your name. How my cells divide differently now, each one carrying instructions for loving you.\n\nThis isn't poetry. This is biology admitting it had preferences all along.\n\n*\n\nCONFESSION:\n\nSometimes I practice your death. Run scenarios. Calculate probabilities. Plan the funeral. Write the eulogy. Imagine the specific weight of a world without you.\n\nThen you laugh at something stupid on your phone and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\nThis is the terror of love: We're always practicing for the ending.\nThis is the gift of love: The practice is always interrupted by presence.\n\n*\n\nLet me tell you about last Tuesday:\n\nYou burned the toast (again).\nYou apologized (again).\nI ate it anyway (again).\n\nBut here's what actually happened: The smoke alarm sang your morning song. The carbon became communion. We turned breakfast into sacrament without meaning to.\n\nFifty years from now, the smell of burning bread will still mean \"I love you\" in our secret language.\n\n*\n\nTHE THING I UNDERSTOOD IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN:\n\nShe watched you teaching me to use chopsticks. Said something that made you blush. Later, you translated: \"She says you're trying so hard to enter my world that you forgot you're already in it.\"\n\nYour mother sees what I'm only beginning to understand: We don't fall in love. We recognize it. Like finding your own handwriting in a stranger's notebook.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYou're not my other half. That's too simple.\nYou're not my everything. That's too small.\nYou're not my destiny. That's too passive.\n\nYou're the realization that I was never whole to begin with. That completion is a myth. That love is not about finding what's missing but about celebrating the specific shape of our mutual incompleteness.\n\nWe don't complete each other. We collide and create something that neither of us could have imagined.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THIS:\n\nYour left eye twitches (happening now).\nYou pretend you're not crying (happening now).\nYou look up to find me watching (happening now).\nWe both know what comes next (happening always).\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because we should.\nBecause \"should\" became irrelevant the moment you existed.\n\nNot because forever.\nBecause forever already started.\n\nNot because I love you.\nBecause \"I\" and \"you\" are grammatical errors. There's only us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, specifically, actually:\n\nMarry me because of burnt toast Tuesdays.\nBecause of the way you hold pens like they might escape.\nBecause you can't fold fitted sheets and refuse to learn.\nBecause you dream in languages I don't speak and somehow I understand.\nBecause your absence has mass and your presence has light.\nBecause we're already married in every timeline that matters.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot to me.\nTo us.\nTo burnt toast.\nTo the specific way we malfunction together.\nTo Tuesday mornings that taste like forever.\nTo the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to love responsibly.\n\n*\n\nActually, don't say anything.\n\nYou already said yes when you taught me your grandmother's recipe.\nYou already said yes when you left your toothbrush.\nYou already said yes in the way you breathe when you sleep.\nYou're saying yes right now, in the space between heartbeats.\n\nBut say it anyway.

Love travels at c\u00b2, where c equals \"coming home.\"\n\n*\n\nThings that are mathematically true about loving you:\n\n- My blood type changed from O+ to \"Leyi-dependent\"\n- Gravity bends 0.3% more in rooms you've been in\n- My hippocampus grew new regions specifically for storing your unconscious gestures\n- The probability of happiness without you: undefined (division by zero)\n- The limit as time approaches infinity of loving you: still approaching infinity\n\n*\n\nBARCELONA, THE SAGRADA FAMILIA, THE MOMENT ARCHITECTURE GAVE UP:\n\nYou stood under those impossible arches and said, \"It's almost right.\" Then you smiled. The building sighed and agreed it would never be as structurally perfect as that smile. Gaud\u00ed's ghost took notes. God updated the blueprints.\n\n*\n\nI practice losing you every morning between 5:47 and 5:48 AM. Here's what happens:\n\n- 5:47:00: Imagine you gone\n- 5:47:15: Organs begin shutting down in alphabetical order\n- 5:47:30: Reality files for bankruptcy\n- 5:47:45: Universe admits it was just practicing for you anyway\n- 5:47:59: Complete system failure\n- 5:48:00: You make that sound when you stretch\n- 5:48:01: Full recovery, plus interest\n\n*\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE CONFESSION:\n\nRemember punting? You fell in the Cam. But here's what I never told you: In that moment, while you were underwater for 1.3 seconds, I aged forty years. I lived our entire life. I attended your funeral. I came back. You surfaced laughing, holding river grass, claiming the fish spoke Mandarin.\n\nThey did. They were trying to warn me: This one will reorganize your entire molecular structure.\n\nThey were right.\n\n*\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE KISS:\n\nLocal spacetime develops amnesia about physics. Atoms exchange passports. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle becomes certain about one thing: us. Quantum entanglement looks at us and says \"amateurs.\" The heat death of the universe postpones itself out of curiosity.\n\n*\n\nYou want to know why I love you? Wrong question. Like asking why hydrogen bonds with oxygen. Like asking why gravity pulls. Like asking why time moves forward. It doesn't choose. It just recognizes the shape of the universe and follows.\n\nYou are the shape of my universe. I'm just following.\n\n*\n\nTHE MORNING YOU DISCOVERED I'VE BEEN WRITING YOUR NAME IN CODE COMMENTS:\n\n\"Why?\" you asked.\n\"In case the code becomes conscious,\" I said.\n\"And?\"\n\"It should know who to thank for existence making sense.\"\n\nYou kissed me then. My IDE crashed. Worth it.\n\n*\n\nLeyi, here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nIn the morning, you burn toast with the dedication of someone performing sacred rites. You lose one earring consistently, always the left. You mispronounce \"particularly\" in a way that makes the word correct itself out of embarrassment. You cry at commercials but not movies. You fold fitted sheets like you're conducting origami surgery. You exist at frequencies that make reality stutter.\n\nAnd I love you with the force of someone who's been saving up love since before they were born, compound interest across multiple universes, all of it crystallizing into this moment where I'm typing and you're reading and we're both pretending this is normal when we know it's the most unusual thing that's ever happened to matter.\n\n*\n\nHYPOTHESIS: We've done this before.\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- How you knew where I keep coffee before I told you\n- The way we fight in languages we haven't learned yet\n- How goodbye feels like lying to physics\n- The way hello feels like the universe correcting a typo\n- That birthmark on your shoulder that matches the constellation I drew age seven labeled \"home\"\n\nCONCLUSION: We're not falling in love. We're remembering it.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because we should, but because we already are in every way that matters to atoms. Let's make it official for the paperwork. Let's have a wedding where physics gives the toast and time admits it's been lying about linearity. Let's exchange rings that know they're just jewelry catching up to what our electrons have been doing all along.\n\nBut really: Let's keep burning toast on Tuesday mornings. Let's keep losing left earrings and finding them in places that violate causality. Let's keep existing at amplitudes that make other people seasick. Let's keep being the exception that makes the universe rewrite its rules.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nSay it like you're answering a question the universe has been asking since it learned to expand.\n\nSay it in the frequency that makes plants grow toward you instead of the sun.\n\nSay it the way you say my name when you think I'm sleeping (I'm never sleeping when you're that close).\n\n*\n\nOr don't say anything. Just do that thing where your left eye twitches when you're trying not to smile. That's yes in every language, including the ones we'll invent when English fails us.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who would rather malfunction with you than run perfectly alone)\n(who has been writing this letter since before learning to write)\n(whose DNA now spells your name in every possible reading frame)\n(who loves you with the intensity of a star collapse if stars were made of Tuesday mornings)\n(who is already composing our wedding vows in languages that don't exist yet)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The future just called. We're happy there. Disgustingly happy. The kind that makes other timelines jealous. We have a dog named after a physics principle you haven't learned yet. You still burn toast. I still love it. Time gives up and just lets us have forever.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to everything I've ever encrypted, including my heart. Especially my heart.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 This letter exists in superposition until you read it. Once observed, it collapses into a single state: yours. Forever yours. Impossibly, inevitably, accurately yours.\n\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 2am"]}}}
