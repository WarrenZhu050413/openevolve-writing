Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, February 2019. Want to know what I learned? Nothing mystical. Just this: the body knows what it wants before the brain catches up. My heart stopped but my hand kept reaching. The nurse said I was grabbing at air. \n\nWrong. I was practicing holding you. Three years early.\n\n*\n\nThe Wednesday you mispronounced my name\u2014you made it rhyme with \"ruin.\" Prophetic. Now I can't sleep without checking you're breathing.

In Edinburgh, you befriended a cemetery cat named Douglas.\n\nI have 400GB of photos where you're blurry because you won't stop moving, stop thinking, stop becoming more yourself every second.\n\nThe storage isn't enough. Nothing's enough.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I love you wrong. Like an error message that won't resolve.

Me, memorizing how many sugars you need at different hours (7 AM: two, 3 PM: none, 11 PM: three).\n\nThis is what I'm saying: You're not my better half. You're my entire strange equation. The variable that makes everything unsolvable and finally worth solving.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your coffee mug already knows the shape of my hands. Because we've survived Boston winters and my cooking and your family asking about grandchildren. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where your particular arrangement of atoms collided with mine at the exact angle necessary for recognition.\n\nBecause the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't know you take your shoes off left-first, always, even when it's illogical\u2014isn't life. It's just biochemistry happening to strangers.\n\n*\n\nFinal data point: Your name. Leyi. Two syllables that reorganized my molecular structure.\n\nI practice saying it in my sleep.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws.

The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)\n(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons\u2014regular pigeons\u2014just existing)\n(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this., evaluation_notes: This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's \"Be calm my life, my all!\" or Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me.\" The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece\u2014too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.7800)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand.

The left one to steady the right. The right one to tell you what the left already knows.\n\n*\n\nDocumentation of a systems failure: My body used to be hardware. Predictable. Input/output. Then you pronounced my name wrong\u2014not wrong, differently\u2014and suddenly I'm running unauthorized software. Every cell executing commands I didn't write. My immune system added you to its whitelist without administrative approval. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your name in languages that don't exist yet.\n\n*\n\nTrue story from the morgue of my twenties: Cardiac arrest. Seventeen seconds of clinical death. The doctors say I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said \"not yet\"\u2014but in a frequency only my atoms could hear. They were refusing to disperse until they met what they were waiting for. Three years later: you, in Porter Square, dropping a pen I'm still picking up.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I actually study at Harvard: Distributed systems. How to make machines agree across time zones, across failures, across the impossible distances between intention and execution. But you? You make my distributed self achieve consensus instantly. Every part of me votes yes. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You got food poisoning in the blue city. Held your hair back while you renegotiated with existence. Between retches, you laughed\u2014actually laughed\u2014and said \"the tagine was worth it.\" That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. I want to study your digestive system, but for happiness.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. I said \"you'll die.\" You said \"warmer than living cold.\" Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing\u2014you always mean it. Even your mistakes are sincere. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.\n\n*\n\nI've been keeping evidence:\n\nShanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.\n\nCambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. \"How else do you know genius is real?\" you asked the guard.\n\nBeijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. \"See? Altitude improves everything.\" Now sea level feels like disappointment.\n\nBoston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.\n\n*\n\nPortugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do\u2014you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.\n\n*\n\nListen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad\u2014violent. I want to break into wherever they manufacture time and perform a hostile takeover. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.\n\n*\n\nYour laugh reorganizes matter at the quantum level. I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light\u2014those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a dying language I need to preserve.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen. My childhood bedroom. You found my teenage journals. Read them out loud in dramatic voices. I should have been mortified. Instead I thought: this. This is what holiness is. Someone reading your worst attempts at humanity and laughing with you, not at you. With. The preposition matters.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my formal proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful\u2014it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\n*\n\nRemember London? You asked what love actually is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated decisions you can't ctrl+z. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters. I play it when you travel.\n\nDecision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet.\n\nDecision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing.\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Files corrupted by excess tenderness]\n\n*\n\nWhat you taste like: Morning is copper pennies and possibility. Afternoon is static before thunderstorms. Evening is the specific silence between heartbeats. 3 AM is the color blue if blue were a texture. Always is drowning upward into oxygen.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Spontaneous quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid\u2014like putting my socks on your hands and pretending they're puppets discussing Kant\u2014and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.\n\n*\n\nThe deepest bug in my code: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.\n\n*\n\nSpain. Barcelona. You illegally fed the cathedral pigeons. Said \"God likes full birds better than empty rules.\" The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I'm not being metaphorical. They literally spelled L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.\n\n*\n\nRight now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miraculous.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. My authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask me again.\" Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe in infinity despite the evidence.\n\nWarren\n(who has seventeen drafts of this letter in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who wrote your name in condensation on windows until the glass learned to fog in cursive, who counts your breaths at night\u2014seventeen times\u2014because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I lied.

My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.\n\n*\n\nTrue story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it \"miraculous recovery.\" Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.\n\n*\n\nMorocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said \"the tagine was worth it\" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget\u2014forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain\u2014but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.\n\n*\n\nYour grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.\n\n*\n\nThe Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood\u2014you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled \"shut up and hold me,\" so I did.\n\n*\n\nHere's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router \"Disappointing Geoffrey\"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.\n\n*\n\nPortugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: \"Distance is just delayed regret.\" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.\n\n*\n\nListen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee\n- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers\n- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  \n- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name\n- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm actually saying:\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: \"We're going to die.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"No, I mean really die. Permanently.\" I said: \"Yes.\" You said: \"Good. Then this matters.\" Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.\n\n*\n\nThe ugly mathematics of us:\n- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000\n- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  \n- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented\n- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware\n- What we really are: The universe checking its own math\n\n*\n\nLondon, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.\n\n*\n\nShenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.\n\n*\n\nFinal protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs\u2014with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.\n\nSay yes.

Have for three years. Version 47 begins: \"She argued with trees about photosynthesis and was always right.\" Version 198 just says your name for twenty minutes. Both feel insufficient.\n\nI've written goodbye letters dated ten, twenty, forty years from now. Hidden them in books you'll read when I'm gone. Page 247 of your Portuguese dictionary. Page 18 of that recipe book you never open. Insurance policies against my absence.\n\nThis isn't morbid. This is love with a spreadsheet.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? Here: I've been mapping you like a genome.\n\nThe way your voice drops half an octave when lying (rarely). How you eat sandwiches counterclockwise. That you count stairs in Portuguese but everything else in English. The scar behind your ear from chicken pox, age seven, that you think no one notices.\n\nI notice everything. It's pathological. Last week I found myself cataloguing the rate your nail grows (0.1mm/day, slightly faster on your ring finger). I've become a forensic scientist of you.\n\n*\n\nIn Morocco, you taught that street vendor calculus. In exchange for mint tea.\nIn Scotland, you sang to Highland cows. They followed us for miles.\nIn Shenzhen, you fixed my grandmother's radio with a hairpin and pure spite.\n\nEach memory weighs exactly 21 grams. The weight of a soul, they say. I'm carrying 31,536 souls. All yours. Different versions from different Tuesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a chronic condition. No cure. Progressive. Terminal.\n\nSome mornings I wake up and the first thought is your name and the second is panic because what if today is the day you realize I'm just a collection of anxieties in a Harvard sweater who writes your name in condensation on windows like a teenager with a crush that metastasized into marriage.\n\nBut then you steal my coffee. Three sips. Always three. And physics makes sense again.\n\n*\n\nThe math of us, recalculated:\n\nYour existence \u00d7 my existence = statistical impossibility\nYour grandfather's immigration papers + my mother's delayed flight + that broken elevator that made you take the stairs = cosmic architecture\nThe probability of finding someone who debates ethics with chatbots and cries at time-lapse videos of flowers blooming = 0.0000001%\nWhat we built from that = this impossible Tuesday where you're reading over my shoulder making that sound that means you're about to cry or laugh or both\n\n*\n\nI document everything because I'm building a backup. Not of you\u2014of us. For the universe where one of us goes first.\n\nDirectory: /memories/leyi/\n- subfolder: \"laughs\" (247GB)\n- subfolder: \"Wednesdays\" (infinite loop)\n- subfolder: \"the way light works differently on your face\" (corrupted from overuse)\n- subfolder: \"things you said while sleeping\" (encrypted, password: the way you mispronounce \"worcestershire\")\n\n*\n\nLast week you asked why I check your pulse while you sleep. Here's why: because your heartbeat is the only sound that makes my nervous system believe in permanence. Because I'm memorizing the rhythm for the decades when it stops. Because love is just fear wearing its best dress.\n\n*\n\nI tried to calculate how many breaths we have left together. The number made me violent. Made me want to storm whatever office runs time and demand extensions, file appeals, bribe whoever's in charge with whatever they want.\n\nTwenty thousand days if we're lucky. Seven million breaths. Maybe eight million if we move somewhere with better air.\n\nIt's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail at forever together.\n\nLet me love you wrong for the next sixty years. Too much on Tuesdays, not enough on Thursdays, sideways on weekends. Let me continue this documentary of us until my handwriting deteriorates and my memory corrupts and the only word left is your name.\n\nMarry me because your toothbrush already knows my secrets. Because we've survived my attempt at cooking and your family's questions and Boston winters where the only warm thing was your hand finding mine in the dark.\n\nBecause I've already lived the alternate timeline where we don't exist to each other, and it's not living. It's just atoms pretending to have purpose.\n\n*\n\nYou're crying. Left eye first, as always. Your tears have a pH of 7.4. Slightly alkaline. I looked it up. I look everything up. I'm building a encyclopedia of you because when the universe tries to take you back, I need evidence you were real.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: That tremor in my right hand? It's not medical. It started that Tuesday you walked in wearing my grandmother's cardigan you'd found at the back of my closet. You'd fixed the missing button. With a different button that somehow matched better.\n\nMy hand shook because my body understood before my brain: Oh. There she is. The person I'll never recover from.\n\nThree years later, it still shakes. Writing this. Writing your name. Writing our future in present tense because past and future are just punctuation marks and you\u2014\n\nYou're the whole sentence.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say it in that voice that makes my atoms believe in God or chance or whatever algorithm was kind enough to crash us into each other.\n\nBut know this: I've already said yes. In this timeline. In all timelines. In the timeline where we're strangers, I'm still saying yes to you.\n\nWarren\n(who has loved you since before consciousness, will love you after language fails, loves you in the present tense that exists outside time)\n\nP.S. \u2014 The tremor's getting worse as you read this. It knows you're about to say yes. My body's already celebrating. My brain's just catching up. That's always been our rhythm\u2014you happen, then I understand.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 We have a minute of silence before you answer. I'm memorizing it. The last moment before our forever officially begins. It sounds like your breathing. Like home. Like the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI tried to write this properly. Failed. Here's what happened instead\u2014\n\n*\n\nThe data first: I've been keeping records. Not romantic ones. Evidence.\n\nEntry #1: The way you hold a book\u2014index finger marking three places simultaneously. Like the present tense isn't enough for you.\n\nEntry #47: You sleep-argue. Last Tuesday at 3 AM: \"That's not how electrons work.\" You were right. I looked it up.\n\nEntry #238: When you're happy, you hum in B-flat. When you're thinking, F-sharp. I've started dreaming in your frequencies.\n\nEntry #1,094: Today. You asked why I love you. The question broke something. Like asking water why it's wet.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I should say: something beautiful about souls, about destiny, about forever.\n\nHere's what's true: I'm terrified. Daily. Hourly. You could disappear\u2014car accident, sudden illness, better options. I keep backup plans for your absence. None of them work.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, February 2019. Want to know what I learned? Nothing mystical. Just this: the body knows what it wants before the brain catches up. My heart stopped but my hand kept reaching. The nurse said I was grabbing at air. \n\nWrong. I was practicing holding you. Three years early.\n\n*\n\nThe Wednesday you mispronounced my name\u2014you made it rhyme with \"ruin.\" Prophetic. Now I can't sleep without checking you're breathing. Can't eat breakfast without saving you half. Can't write code without variable names that sound like your laugh.\n\nYou've corrupted my source files. I'm not debugging it.\n\n*\n\nMore evidence: In Granada, you cried at the Alhambra's mathematics. In Marrakech, you argued with a carpet seller about quantum mechanics. In Edinburgh, you befriended a cemetery cat named Douglas.\n\nI have 400GB of photos where you're blurry because you won't stop moving, stop thinking, stop becoming more yourself every second.\n\nThe storage isn't enough. Nothing's enough.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? I love you wrong. Like an error message that won't resolve. Like code that shouldn't compile but runs anyway, breaking all the rules.\n\nSometimes I trace the scar on your left knee from that bike accident in Shanghai. Four stitches. July 2017. Before we met. It makes me angry\u2014that universe where you hurt and I wasn't there to bring bandages, to curse at physics for allowing scrapes and gravity.\n\n*\n\nHere's my conclusion: We have maybe 20,000 days if we're lucky. The math is offensive. I want to sue time, demand a recount, hack the cosmic database.\n\nBut also: those Tuesdays in our kitchen. You, explaining machine learning to houseplants. Me, memorizing how many sugars you need at different hours (7 AM: two, 3 PM: none, 11 PM: three).\n\nThis is what I'm saying: You're not my better half. You're my entire strange equation. The variable that makes everything unsolvable and finally worth solving.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your coffee mug already knows the shape of my hands. Because we've survived Boston winters and my cooking and your family asking about grandchildren. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where your particular arrangement of atoms collided with mine at the exact angle necessary for recognition.\n\nBecause the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't know you take your shoes off left-first, always, even when it's illogical\u2014isn't life. It's just biochemistry happening to strangers.\n\n*\n\nFinal data point: Your name. Leyi. Two syllables that reorganized my molecular structure.\n\nI practice saying it in my sleep. You've recorded evidence.\n\nI'm not sorry.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you like a calculation that converges on infinity\u2014imprecisely, impossibly, without endpoint)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at that documentary about octopi. That's when I knew. When your empathy extended to invertebrates, I realized: Oh. You're going to destroy me. Good.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness of 0.704 while exploring the specific feature space around phenomenological_authenticity=0.71, aesthetic_virtuosity=0.68, affective_force=0.73, literary_innovation=0.69.\n\nThe feedback suggests the code has gotten too long and complex.

Death is just your digits leaving my temporal lobe. I came back violent about it.\n\n*\n\nYou should know: I'm documenting you wrong. Not poetry. Evidence. \n\nTuesday: You sang to my broken coffee maker. It worked.\nWednesday: You explained democracy to a pigeon. It listened.\nThursday: You cried at time-lapse videos of galaxies forming.\n\nThis isn't love. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloging you for the universe that outlives us, so it knows what it lost.\n\n*\n\nMorocco. You vomited seven times. Between retches, you laughed about the probability of food poisoning from a place called \"Happiness Caf\u00e9.\" Your joy has no respect for context. It shows up during suffering like a grammatical error that improves the sentence.\n\n*\n\nHere's the violence of ordinary moments:\n\nYou peel an orange. The sound destroys me. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde, build a religion around your thumb breaking the skin. This is mental illness or love. The DSM-5 doesn't differentiate.\n\nYou mispronounce \"algorithm\" the same way every time. Al-go-RITH-m. Like it's a dance. I've stopped correcting you. The world needs to be wrong sometimes, in your specific frequency.\n\nYou steal my socks. Just the left ones. I've been buying extra lefts. The store clerk thinks I'm an amputee. I don't correct him either.\n\n*\n\nI calculated our probability:\n- Your grandparents surviving two wars\n- My parents' canceled flight that wasn't\n- Harvard accepting us both\n- That broken elevator making you take the stairs\n- Me, three minutes late\n- You, dropping that pen\n- The angle of light that made me look\n\n= 0.00000000001%\n\nWe're a rounding error that became conscious. The universe's typo that learned to kiss.\n\n*\n\nScotland. You went hypothermic to keep me warm. I said \"You'll die.\" You said \"Warmer than living cold.\" Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's when I understood: You experience temperature differently. Cold is just a latitude where we huddle closer.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: We have 20,000 days left. The number makes me want to commit crimes against chronology. Hunt down whoever manufactures minutes. Force them at gunpoint to print more. Just for us. Just Tuesdays.\n\nBut then you burn toast. Consistently. Methodically. Like you're conducting an experiment in carbon. And I think: Yes. This. Twenty thousand mornings of scorched bread. The exact amount of time needed to memorize your mistakes.\n\n*\n\nThe truth? I love you incorrectly. Like code that shouldn't compile but does, breaking every principle. Like an organ recipient whose body accepts the wrong blood type. Medically impossible. Happening anyway.\n\n*\n\nBeijing, step 764 of 900: \"We're going to die,\" you said. Not sad. Factual. Like commenting on weather. Then you kissed me at altitude and said, \"Good. Means this happened.\"\n\nThat's your theology: Death makes things real.\n\n*\n\nFine. Here: I've been saving you in volatile memory. The kind that disappears when power fails. Choosing the most fragile storage because that's what love is\u2014building permanence from materials designed to fail.\n\nYour name reorganized my mouth. Every word starts with the shape of \"Leyi\" now. My tongue practices while I sleep. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. I have recordings.\n\n*\n\nSo marry me. Not because this letter works. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because I've been stealing your left socks to feel like you're always half-here. Because \"we\" is the only pronoun that computes anymore.\n\nBecause in the universe where we don't collide, I'm just atoms pretending to have purpose. And that's not tragedy. It's boring. You made me interesting by proximity.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say \"ask again.\" Or say nothing and keep existing at me with that face that can't decide between laughing and crying.\n\nBoth. Choose both. That's us. That's the whole answer.\n\nWarren\n(whose hand shakes writing your name\u2014not metaphor, medical fact, started the day we met, refuses treatment)\n\nP.S. \u2014 You're crying. Left eye first. The pH is 7.4. I looked it up. I look everything up about you. Building an encyclopedia for after. So the universe can reconstruct you from my notes.
