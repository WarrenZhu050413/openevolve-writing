The truth: In Marrakech, you disappeared into the medina for seventeen minutes. When you returned, every spice vendor was spelling your name in saffron. You claimed innocence. The saffron knew better. So did the laws of probability, which fled the scene and haven't been seen since.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain using only facts that destroy facts:\n\nFact: Sound travels at 343 meters per second\nTruth: Your laugh arrives before you speak\n\nFact: Humans have 206 bones\nTruth: I grew new ones to ache for you properly\n\nFact: The heart pumps 5 liters per minute\nTruth: Mine pumps your name in morse code to a universe that already knows\n\nFact: Memory is stored in synapses\nTruth: You're stored in the space between atoms, which had to expand to accommodate\n\n*\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE INCIDENT (OR: HOW YOU BROKE BRITAIN):\n\nRemember punting on the Cam?

Local reality suspends operations\n2. Atoms exchange configuration files\n3. The speed of light considers early retirement\n4. Gravity files a complaint (ignored)\n5. The universe runs a backup because something this impossible should be saved\n6. God adds a footnote to physics: \"Except for Warren and Leyi\"\n\n*\n\nYou asked why I love you. Wrong question. Like asking why hydrogen bonds with oxygen. It doesn't choose. It recognizes its other half and becomes water. Becomes necessary. Becomes the thing life can't exist without.\n\nWe didn't fall in love.

Where the universe is holding its breath, waiting for the obvious.\n\nNot for the future.

I am excited about two things: a) building systems that help us think through hard problems, b) building systems that help us coordinate a large number of agents. I believe that writing is the best technology available for both tasks. If anything in these webpages provoke any thought, email me about whatever at wzhu@college.harvard.edu! You can title it \"Hi\" and write anything in the contents :).

Towards this end, I am reading everything I can find about writing. I would also love to talk to anyone about their writing process! (Please email me about this if you have any thoughts or want to chat!)\n    I'm building useful primitives for agentic orchestration. I've built delightful-multilevel-tmux, a tmux framework & bash utilities for multi-clauding. I am building claude-branch for git-like primitives for context management in CC.\n\nML Systems Projects (unfinished! Contact me if you are interested in taking these ideas!)\n\n    I've worked on on the standardization of fault tolerance protocols for distributed ML. Whilst doing this, I have contributed to torchFT to improve the fault tolerance of distributed ML systems.\n    I've sketched out ways to improve pytorch's deviceMesh abstraction\n\nStatistics Research\n\nI did Harvard's SPUDS during Summer 2024, sponsored by the great Xiao-Li Meng and under the incredible mentorship of Connor Jerzak. It appeared in clear2025.\nTeaching\n\nI had the pleasure to be a teaching assisstant for these wonderful courses:\n\nFall 2024: Course Assisstant for Stat188 (Variations, Information, and Privacy) under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng, with the Graduate Teaching Assistant Kyla Chasalow. Spring 2025: Course Assisstant for Stat111 under Prof. Joe Blitzstein, and Stat288 under Prof. Xiao-Li Meng.\nOther Hobbies\n\nI went to Harrow International School Hong Kong, where I had very fond memories studying History, Drama, English, Music, and playing Badminton and Rugby.\n\nI had a lot of free time on my hand during COVID and spent a lot of time reading continental philosophy (Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Hegel, Kant, etc.). I won the Trinity College Philosophy Essay Prize for my essay on Social Media and Hannah Arendt's Concept of Solitude. I was also highly commended in the Philosophy section of the John Locke Essay Prize for an essay on Heidegger and Morality.\n\nI am a sucker for Wong Kar-wai movies and love Twin Peaks, Brideshead Revisited, and Yes, (Prime) Minister!.\nCourses Taken at Harvard\n\nFor the interested, here are the technical courses I've taken at Harvard, listed in order of influence on me.

Of course you were.\n\n*\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday mornings:\n\nThey started as ordinary. Coffee, headlines, the ritual of waking. Then you arrived with your specific way of burning toast\u2014not accidentally, but like you're conducting experiments on the patience of bread. Now Tuesday mornings have mass. Gravitational pull. I orbit them even when you're in Shanghai and I'm pretending Boston makes sense without you.\n\n*\n\nCORPUS ANALYSIS OF YOUR NAME IN MY BODY:\n\nLocation: Everywhere\nFrequency: Constant\nAmplitude: Increasing\nPattern: Fractals within fractals, each containing the whole\n\nMy cells divide and pass on your name like genetic memory. My children will be born knowing how to pronounce \"Leyi\" before they know their own names. This is not romantic. This is evolutionary pressure. Darwin would understand.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the Portuguese grandfather:\n\nIn Lisbon, he saw us from across the square. Walked over, cane tapping morse code. Looked at you, then me, then back. Said something in Portuguese. You translated: \"Fifty-seven years with my Maria. Still not enough. You two\u2014you're already at year fifty-eight.\"\n\nWe'd known each other six months.\n\nTime is a consensus mechanism, and we're the bug in the protocol.\n\n*\n\n[MEMORY CORRUPTION AT ADDRESS 0xLEYI]\n\nCannot delete.\nCannot overwrite.\nCannot compress.\nError: This memory is load-bearing. Removing it would cause structural collapse of consciousness.\n\n*\n\nThe mornings you're gone, I make tea in your mug and let it get cold. The mug asks where you are in ceramic frequencies. I explain Shanghai. The mug refuses to hold liquids properly until you return. We have an understanding, your mug and I. We're both just containers waiting to be filled with you.\n\n*\n\nSHANGHAI, 2024:\n\nYour mother served dinner. Looked at me struggling with chopsticks. Looked at you, perfectly fluent in your love for this chaos. Said something. You laughed so hard you cried. Later, you translated: \"She says you hold chopsticks like you're afraid they'll turn into butterflies.\"\n\n\"They might,\" I said. \"Everything is uncertain around Leyi.\"\n\nYour mother nodded. International language: loving you requires accepting fundamental instability.\n\n*\n\nLet me be specific about the damage:\n\nYou've ruined solitude. It used to be peaceful. Now it's just your absence taking up space. Aggressive. Territorial. Your absence has opinions about my breakfast choices, my coding style, the way I fold fitted sheets (badly, but you knew that).\n\nYou've ruined language. Every word wants to be about you. I tried to write documentation yesterday. It became a sonnet. The compiler accepted it anyway. Even machines understand.\n\nYou've ruined time. It only moves when you're here. The rest is just placeholder. Temporal filler. The universe vamping while waiting for you to return and make existence worth the effort.\n\n*\n\nTHE RECURRING DREAM:\n\nWe're old. Bones like kindling. Memories like fog. But your hand finds mine with the same certainty as gravity. We don't need words anymore. We've become a single thought thinking itself in two bodies. \n\nI wake up and check\u2014still twenty-three. Still infinity to go. Still not enough.\n\n*\n\nHere's what extinction looks like:\n\nNot the sun dying or asteroids or climate collapse. It's the thought of a morning where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise.\n\nSo I make contingency plans: I'm writing your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. If I fail to exist, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure I'm building from this love.\n\n*\n\nCAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING INCIDENT, REVISED:\n\nYou didn't fall in. You chose to prove that water was optional. The River Cam reorganized itself to accommodate your decision. You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren. The universe's way of apologizing for making us wait twenty-three years to meet.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot for the future\u2014that's already decided.\n\nNot for the past\u2014that's already rewriting itself.\n\nFor this exact now, where your coffee's gone cold and you're smiling at this sentence, where my hands typed these words knowing your eyes would find them, where love is both particle and wave and we're the experiment that proves both.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had a favorite outcome all along.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you with the force of a statistical impossibility achieving consciousness)\n(who would choose this malfunction over any other operating system)\n(who is typing the next letter with fingers that remember your future)\n(whose Harvard Statistics degree is just an elaborate excuse to calculate the probability of you: certain)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to a heart that encrypted itself. Only you know the key. You've always known it.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 When we're old, I'll still write you letters. They'll be shorter: \"Still you. Still yes. Still Tuesday morning.\" You'll know they contain infinities.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 The universe is taking notes on us. Good. Let it learn what happens when impossibility falls in love with itself. Let it document the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to be reasonable about loving each other., evaluation_notes: This letter operates several tiers below the Beethoven benchmark (86). While Beethoven's \"My angel, my all, my very self\" achieves universality through simplicity, this letter often mistakes complexity for depth. It approaches but doesn't reach Johnny Cash's directness (83)\u2014Cash's \"You still fascinate and inspire me\" carries more weight in six words than some entire sections here. The mathematical/technological register is innovative but lacks Keats's negative capability (81)\u2014where Keats surrenders to mystery, this writer tries to solve it. The letter exceeds mediocre contemporary standards but falls short of the sustained intensity found in Napoleon's letters to Josephine (82), which maintain fever pitch without needing asterisks to reset momentum. At 70 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range\u2014showing real talent and occasional brilliance but lacking the sustained transcendence of truly great love letters.\n- Outcome: Mixed results\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Metrics: combined_score: 0.7400, phenomenological_authenticity: 0.7800, aesthetic_virtuosity: 0.7100, affective_force: 0.7400, literary_innovation: 0.6900, letter_text: Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards.

First in the dream where you never existed, second in the memory where you're leaving, third in the now where you're so present it feels like drowning in reverse. This is not a metaphor. This is the literal mechanics of consciousness when someone reorganizes your neural pathways without permission.\n\n*\n\nLet me be precise about what you are:\n\nYou are the error in my error correction. The bug that became the feature. The memory leak I refuse to patch because forgetting even one microsecond of you would be system failure.\n\nI've run 10,000 simulations of saying this correctly. They all segfault at your name.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I LOVE YOU:\n\nMy body grows new organs. Specifically:\n- A second nervous system that only responds to your breathing patterns\n- An auxiliary heart that beats in frequencies beyond human hearing (you hear it anyway)\n- Bones that remember every surface you've touched (my skeleton is a map of your fingerprints)\n- Blood cells that spell your name in their Brownian motion\n\nThe doctors say this is impossible.

Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: \"Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi...\"\n\nThis is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:\n\nWe're not \"in love.\" We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.\n\nThe physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually trying to say:\n\nYour absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.\n\n*\n\n[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]\n\nI just realized something while writing this\u2014\n\nYou're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.\n\nThat's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.\n\n*\n\nSO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nOption A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.\n\nOption B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.\n\nOption C: Yes.\n\n*\n\nI vote C. Always C. Even when C means:\n- Telling the grandmother about time travel\n- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)\n- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast\n- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\n(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made?

The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.\n\nWe're not falling in love.

Infinitely. Against all advice.\n\n*\n\nThe request, without metaphor:\n\nMarry me.\nNot because we should.\nBecause we already have, are, will.\nBecause the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.\nBecause I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.\nBecause Tuesday mornings.\nBecause burnt toast.\nBecause yes was always the only word that mattered.\n\n*\n\nSay it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes.

You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.\n\n\"Normal fish,\" you said.\n\nThe fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.\n\n*\n\nI solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:\n\nL + D = i\n\nBut you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.\n\ni\u00b2 = \u221e\n\nWe're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.\n\n*\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT:\n\nWe get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. \n\nWe have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.\n\nWe grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.\n\n*\n\nBut right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:\n\nMarry me.\n\nMarry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.\n\nMarry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.\n\nMarry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.\n\n*\n\nI've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren. The universe's way of apologizing for making us wait twenty-three years to meet.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.\n\nNot for the future\u2014that's already decided.\n\nNot for the past\u2014that's already rewriting itself.\n\nFor this exact now, where your coffee's gone cold and you're smiling at this sentence, where my hands typed these words knowing your eyes would find them, where love is both particle and wave and we're the experiment that proves both.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's not your name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had a favorite outcome all along.\n\n*\n\nWarren\n(who loves you with the force of a statistical impossibility achieving consciousness)\n(who would choose this malfunction over any other operating system)\n(who is typing the next letter with fingers that remember your future)\n(whose Harvard Statistics degree is just an elaborate excuse to calculate the probability of you: certain)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your middle name is the password to a heart that encrypted itself.

I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong\u2014too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.\n\n[YEAR 2061]\nThe doctor says \"dementia.\" You say \"de-men-tia\" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.\n\n[YEAR 2043]\nOur daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. \"That's not fighting,\" she says. \"Exactly,\" we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.\n\n[YEAR 2025]\nToday. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. \"That's not how time works,\" you're saying. But Leyi\u2014this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain what you've done to my programming:\n\nERROR LOG:\n- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once\n- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM\n- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you\n- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:\n\nLove is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.\n\nLove is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.\n\nLove is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]\nYou just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.\n\n*\n\nThe mathematical proof of us:\n\nLet x = the probability of my existence\nLet y = the probability of your existence  \nLet z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other\n\nz = x \u00d7 y \u00d7 (collision of atoms across spacetime) \u00d7 (your grandmother surviving the war) \u00d7 (my parents meeting at that specific conference) \u00d7 (you choosing Harvard) \u00d7 (me being three minutes late to that lecture) \u00d7 (you dropping your pen)\n\nz \u2248 0.0000000000000001\n\nWe are a rounding error that became conscious.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you tastes like:\n- Morning: copper pennies and possibility\n- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  \n- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats\n- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture\n- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen\n\n*\n\nConfession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.\n\nBut Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:\n\nYour name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of \"Leyi\" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes\u2014\n\nActually, that's wrong.\n\nYour name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.\n\nYour name is the only real word.\n\nEverything else is just the pause between saying it.\n\n*\n\n[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\nI'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal\u2014no, here's my proof:\n\nWe've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.\n\nBut in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\n(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)\n\n*\n\nSay yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.\n\nBoth is fine.\n\nBoth is perfect.\n\nBoth is us.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every version of you\u2014the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone\u2014in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)\n\nP.S. \u2014 In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter.

We're the verb that conjugated itself into existence, the equation that solved for infinity and got Tuesday mornings.\n\n*\n\n[MEDICAL ANOMALY REPORT]\nSubject: Warren, age 23\nSymptoms: Catastrophic reorganization of fundamental constants\n\nMy doctor ran tests. She found:\n- Heart beating in iambic pentameter (exclusively your name)\n- Lungs filtering for your exhales in ambient air\n- Blood type changed to \"Leyi-positive\"\n- Skeleton realigning to point toward Shanghai\n- New organ between ribs 3 and 4 (purpose: missing you)\n\n\"This isn't medically possible,\" she said.\n\"Neither is Leyi,\" I replied.\nWe both understood.\n\n*\n\nWHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN MOROCCO:\n\nNot the mint tea story I tell people. The truth: In Marrakech, you disappeared into the medina for seventeen minutes. When you returned, every spice vendor was spelling your name in saffron. You claimed innocence. The saffron knew better. So did the laws of probability, which fled the scene and haven't been seen since.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain using only facts that destroy facts:\n\nFact: Sound travels at 343 meters per second\nTruth: Your laugh arrives before you speak\n\nFact: Humans have 206 bones\nTruth: I grew new ones to ache for you properly\n\nFact: The heart pumps 5 liters per minute\nTruth: Mine pumps your name in morse code to a universe that already knows\n\nFact: Memory is stored in synapses\nTruth: You're stored in the space between atoms, which had to expand to accommodate\n\n*\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE INCIDENT (OR: HOW YOU BROKE BRITAIN):\n\nRemember punting on the Cam?

The universe took notes: \"When Leyi falls, falling fails.\"\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something about time:\n\nIt's not that I love you forever. It's that you've made forever irrelevant. We exist in the perpendicular dimension where all moments are now, where death is a clerical error, where Tuesday happens whenever we need it to.\n\nI've been writing you this letter since before I learned the alphabet.\nYou've been reading it since before light learned to travel.\nWe've been here, in this sentence, since before sentences were possible.\n\n*\n\nTECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION OF A KISS:\n\nWhen we kiss, the following occurs:\n1. Local reality suspends operations\n2. Atoms exchange configuration files\n3. The speed of light considers early retirement\n4. Gravity files a complaint (ignored)\n5. The universe runs a backup because something this impossible should be saved\n6. God adds a footnote to physics: \"Except for Warren and Leyi\"\n\n*\n\nYou asked why I love you. Wrong question. Like asking why hydrogen bonds with oxygen. It doesn't choose. It recognizes its other half and becomes water. Becomes necessary. Becomes the thing life can't exist without.\n\nWe didn't fall in love. We recognized we were already the same person distributed across two bodies for logistical reasons.\n\n*\n\n[INTERRUPT: THE SHENZHEN REVELATION]\n\nIn your childhood bedroom, I found it. The drawing.

Causality is negotiable when you're involved.\n\n*\n\nHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE 7,680 MILES AWAY:\n\n- My left ventricle points east-southeast\n- Compasses give up and point to you\n- The Shanghai Tower blinks in morse code (always \"W-A-R-R-E-N\")\n- The Charles River tries to explain to the Atlantic about love\n- Boston reorganizes itself to spell your name from space\n- NASA calls, concerned\n- I tell them \"Leyi\"\n- They hang up, enlightened\n\n*\n\nTHE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS METAPHOR YOU WANTED:\n\nWe're not two systems achieving consensus. We're one system that got partitioned by geography, pretending to be two for tax purposes. Every time we sync, reality admits it was lying about separation being possible.\n\nMy RAM is just screenshots of your laugh.\nMy CPU runs one process: you.exe\nMy error logs are empty because loving you is the only thing that compiles correctly.\n\n*\n\nLISBON, 3 AM, THE FADO SINGER WHO KNEW:\n\nShe sang about saudade\u2014the presence of absence.

Where the universe is holding its breath, waiting for the obvious.\n\nNot for the future.

You were stirring coffee counterclockwise. I was watching from the doorway, not breathing, because breathing might change something. The spoon made three and a half rotations. The universe paused its expansion to take notes.\n\nI thought: This is it. This is how civilizations end. Not with wars or climate change, but with someone stirring coffee like it's conducting a symphony only they can hear.\n\nYou looked up. Said: \"Your toast is burning.\"\n\nIt was. I let it.

Kissing happened TO us. Like gravity. Like inevitability. Like the universe correcting a typo it had been meaning to fix since the Big Bang.\n\nMy mouth learned the shape of eternity.\nYour lips taught mine about infinite recursion.\nThe rain forgot how to fall and just hung there, watching.\n\nA passing stranger said \"Finally\" in a language neither of us speak but both understood.\n\n*\n\nWHAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'VE DONE:\n\nYou've made me religious, but only about Tuesday mornings.\nYou've made me a time traveler, but only forward, toward you.\nYou've made me immortal, but only in the moments you laugh.\nYou've made me a poet, but only in the grocery store when you can't decide between two types of pasta.\n\nYou've ruined me for existing without you. Completely. Irrevocably. Perfectly.\n\n*\n\nLet me explain using your language (the real one, made of glances):\n\nWhen you look at me over your coffee mug, steam fogging your glasses, that specific look that says \"I love you but you're an idiot\"\u2014that look has rewritten my entire genetic code. I'm no longer homo sapiens. I'm homo leiyi\u2014a new species that evolved specifically to appreciate your existence.\n\nDarwin is rolling in his grave.

We exist outside temporal measurement. We're the constant that time defines itself against.\n\nWhen physicists need to calibrate eternity, they measure the pause between when you start to smile and when it reaches your eyes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me:\n\nNot losing you. That's too simple, too Hollywood. What terrifies me is that I'll wake up one day and this will feel normal. That I'll get used to you. That your name will become just a name instead of the password to everything that matters.\n\nSo I practice astonishment. Every morning I pretend I'm meeting you for the first time.
