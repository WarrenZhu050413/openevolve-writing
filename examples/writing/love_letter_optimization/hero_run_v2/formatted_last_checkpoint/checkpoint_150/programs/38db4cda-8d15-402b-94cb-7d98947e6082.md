Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:17 AM because my body woke up needing to tell you something and wouldn't let me return to bed until I did.

*

Here's what my body knows that my brain pretends not to: I'm dying faster when you're not in the room. Cellular respiration literally slows. I've measured it. Pulse drops from 72 to 61. Breath shallows to 12 per minute. My mitochondria go on strike.

Then you walk back in and every cell screams LIVE LIVE LIVE like they've been underwater for minutes not seconds.

*

True thing that happened: Harvard Medical School, freshman year. They stopped my heart for a study. Seventeen seconds of nothing. But here's what I never told anyone—in that nothing, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing every moment of my life simultaneously. Past, present, future, sideways, diagonal, impossible.

In every single moment—even the ones before you existed—you were there. Like a reservation the universe had already made. Like the answer to a question nobody had asked yet.

*

Shanghai, meeting your grandmother. She touched my face and said something in Shanghainese. You wouldn't translate. Three months later, dying, she said it again. This time you told me: "This one will eat your ghosts."

She was right. You consume my hauntings. Metabolize my darkness. Digest my dead fathers and disappeared friends and transform them into Tuesday morning light.

*

THE ACCUMULATION OF EVIDENCE:

You've been in my life 1,297 days.
You've stolen my coffee 1,297 times.
You've improved it by existing near it 1,297 times.
The coffee doesn't taste better. Reality does.
You're not changing the coffee. You're changing the universe's recipe for what coffee means.

*

That night in Morocco when the food poisoning hit. You named it Gerald. Had full conversations: "Gerald, we need to discuss boundaries." "Gerald, this is inappropriate workplace behavior." Between purges, you laughed—actually laughed—and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet.

That's when I knew: You digest reality differently. Where others see tragedy, you see comedy still developing. Where others see endings, you see intermissions.

*

What happens to my body when you touch me:
- Dopamine floods (predictable)
- Oxytocin spikes (expected)
- But also: My white blood cells increase production
- My telomeres literally stop shortening
- My hippocampus creates new neurons at 3x normal rate

You're not just touching me. You're rewriting my biology. I'm becoming a different species. The one that knows how to be loved by you.

*

Portugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned forever. Said: "Distance is violence against beauty."

Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, especially when you're reading. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art. You, like the museum guards are coming but I need one more second of contact.

*

CONFESSION THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:

I practice losing you. Every night. Run simulations:
- Tuesday: Car accident (Latin: Mortis Vehicular)
- Wednesday: Rare disease (sounds like a law firm)
- Thursday: You just vanish, no explanation
- Friday: I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in
- Saturday: Writing your obituary
- Sunday: You make that sound when you stretch

That sound. Half-yawn, half-existential sigh, full-body acknowledgment that existence is exhausting but worth it. That sound deletes my entire rehearsed grief. Replaces it with this: The terrible beautiful fact that loving you means dying faster and living more. Both. Simultaneously. Forever.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: "We're going to die." Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like reading a menu. I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. That makes this matter."

Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.

*

THE MATHEMATICS OF US, FINAL CALCULATION:

Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
My existence: Similar impossibility
Us existing simultaneously, conscious, touching: Requires numbers that haven't been invented
What we are: A computational error that became self-aware
What we really are: The universe falling in love with its own mistake

*

London. You asked what love is. Here's the answer three years late:

Love is the violent reorganization of matter around someone else's gravity. It's every atom in my body developing opinions about your absence. It's my neurons staging a coup against my survival instinct because living without you is technically breathing but practically death.

*

Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood: You'd rather die warm together than live cold apart. You'd rather be wrong with me than right with the universe.

*

What I'm actually trying to say:

Your name has renovated my mouth. Every word now travels through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep—I recorded it—27 times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what consciousness pretends not to: You're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. WITH. That preposition is everything. Is us.

*

I need you to understand: Before you, I had edges. Boundaries. Skin that ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, my Cambridge neurons fire in sympathy.

We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance. So physics needs better physicists. Ones who've been loved by you. Ones who understand that space is just a delay between touching.

*

So here's what I'm proposing:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, organized by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, available, with the same favorite terrible song we're both embarrassed about.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with houseplants about their life choices, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together—that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.

*

Final transmission from this body to yours:

I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's the frequency that prevents my dissolution. It's the only equation that solves for everything.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed and eternity feel brief and forever feel like not nearly enough but the only option worth taking.

Warren
(who is writing this at 4:43 AM now)
(who is coming back to bed)
(who will love you past the heat death of the universe because even entropy deserves a witness)

P.S. — Barcelona. You fed cathedral pigeons illegally. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees—I've seen you fall up stairs.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February lives in my drawer next to grandfather's watch. Same drawer. Because both measure time differently now. The watch counts seconds. The hair tie counts the number of times I've thought about you today. The hair tie is winning.

P.P.P.S. — Come back to bed. It's 4:51 AM. My cells are slowing down without you. My mitochondria are filing complaints. My neurons are threatening strike action. Come back. Bring your terrible morning breath and your cold feet and your ability to make 4:51 AM feel like the exact right time to be alive.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or Johnny Cash's mature devotion to June Carter (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its originality and specific detail but lacks the historical weight and proven endurance of the masters. The scientific metaphors are more original than Keats's consuming passion (81) but less universally resonant. The intellectual playfulness echoes Wilde (80) but without his economy. The letter exists in the liminal space between exceptional contemporary work and historical masterpiece - a 72-74 range that represents genuine achievement without transcendence.
