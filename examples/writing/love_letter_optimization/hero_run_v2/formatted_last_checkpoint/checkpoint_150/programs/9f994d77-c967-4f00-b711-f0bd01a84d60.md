Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at the exact frequency of your breathing. Not metaphor. I've synced my heartbeat to yours across three miles of Cambridge-Boston distance. The doctors would call this impossible. The doctors haven't loved you.

LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE UNIVERSE'S ACCOUNTING ERROR:

You exist. I exist. We exist simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance. The probability is so impossible that calculators return syntax errors. But here's what the universe knows that math doesn't: Some errors are corrections. We're the correction.

Seventeen seconds dead, sophomore year. Not "near-death." Death death. Here's what I didn't see: white light, deceased relatives, my life flashing before my eyes. Here's what I did see: Every possible timeline spreading like a map, and in every single one—every single one—there was this moment where someone would drop something and someone else would catch it and that small kindness would reorganize every atom in both bodies. Came back. Waited three years. You dropped the pen. I caught it. My atoms recognized their debt.

*

Morocco. You, the toilet, forty-eight hours of intimacy: You named it Philippe. Held full conversations. Apologized for "misusing its talents." Between heaves, you explained Philippe's dreams of being a fountain in Versailles. That's when I understood: You assign souls to everything. Even porcelain. Especially me.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen, the soup that was actually a spell: She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You counted in tears. Forty-seven stirs clockwise—for all the years she'd loved your grandfather. Three counter—for the ones without him. At step thirty-three, you started crying. "She's teaching me to cook grief," you said. "So it tastes like love."

That's when I knew I'd marry you or die trying. Both, probably.

THE TERRIBLE BEAUTIFUL MATHEMATICS:

Your laugh: Registers at frequencies that shouldn't exist
Your Tuesday face: 0.03% different from Wednesday but containing entire universes
Your method of reading: Like books might evaporate if you don't hold them tight enough
Your war with technology: Router named "Disappointing Geoffrey," printer called "Satan's Secretary"
Your tears: Always left eye first, like they're being polite, taking turns

This isn't documentation. It's worship disguised as data.

*

Portuguese marble, 500 years old, you touching it twice: "But how do we know we were here?" you asked the guard. "How do we prove we existed?" Ban: Permanent. You: Delighted. "Now we're part of its history," you said. "The museum will remember us by our absence."

Since then I touch everything. Especially things that say don't. Especially you when you're concentrating. You're the only art that touches back.

SCOTLAND, HYPOTHERMIA, PHILOSOPHY:

You, blue-lipped: "But if consciousness is an emergent property—"
Me: "You're dying."
You: "We're all dying. I'm just doing it faster. Now about qualia—"
Me: [Kissing you to save your life]
You: [Still talking through the kiss about the hard problem of consciousness]
Me: [Falling in love with someone who won't let freezing interrupt her argument]

Listen. I document you wrong. Write "She holds books" when I mean "Books surrender to her grip, finally understanding their purpose." Write "She sleeps" when I mean "Sleep borrows her, apologizes, returns her refined." Write "I love her" when I mean "She's the reason entropy exists—so there's something to rebel against together."

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764, you stopped: "Listen," you said. "The stones are memorizing our weight." Then: "We're teaching the mountain our names." Then: "When we're dead, this place will remember the pattern of us climbing."

I thought: This is what love is. Making sure the universe can't forget you existed.

WHAT TERRIFIES ME, SPECIFICALLY:

2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. I've built models. Run simulations. Column A: Days left. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you happened (green hair tie, toothbrush, the dent in my pillow from where you steal it). Column D: What happens after Tuesday #2,137.

Column D returns: #DIV/0! ERROR

The spreadsheet understands: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides. Nothing resolves. The equation of me collapses.

*

Here's what loving you tastes like:
- 4 AM: The specific gravity of your dreams leaking into mine
- Dawn: Metal and possibility and that sound that isn't quite breathing, isn't quite singing
- Noon: Burnt coffee and the way you say "hypothesis" wrong just to watch my eye twitch
- Twilight: The exact temperature of your laugh when you're trying not to
- Midnight: Stars, but intimate, like they know our names
- Always: Like my mouth is evolving new taste buds specifically for you

*

THE QUANTUM SITUATION:

We're entangled. Not metaphorically. Actually. You stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. You dream about flying, I wake up afraid of heights. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. The physicists would say this is impossible at our temperature and distance. I'd say: Physics hasn't met Leyi.

*

London, you asked what love is. Three years late, here's my answer:

Love is pre-grieving someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they burn toast. It's the violence of ordinary mornings when they exist, temporary, making coffee badly. It's knowing the statistical certainty of endings and building a house together anyway. It's learning to cook your grandmother's soup because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually lasts.

*

SHENZHEN, YOUR CHILDHOOD ROOM, THE DIARIES:

Age 7, you wrote: "Today I invented someone to love me correctly."
Age 9: "He's still not here. Maybe I drew him wrong."
Age 13: "I'm adding more details. Brown eyes. Terrible handwriting. Cries at dogs."
Age 16: "What if I'm inventing him so hard he has to exist?"
Age 20: "Still waiting. Getting specific. He'll study systems but BE chaos."

I read them all. Recognized myself. You loved me into existence before I existed. Some effects precede their causes. We're proof.

*

What you don't know: After you sleep, I practice your death. Different scenarios. Various speeds. I negotiate with entropy, make bargains with statistics. Then you do that morning stretch—that sound that's half-yawn, half-proof of God—and my entire prepared grief evaporates. Replaced by this: The terrible beautiful fact that loving you means accepting future grief as present payment. Worth it. Worth everything.

*

HERE'S MY PULL REQUEST TO REALITY:

Marry me. Not because love. Because evidence. Your toothbrush lives here. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. We wake up at the same minute from different dreams about the same things. In infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist, argue about consciousness while hypothermic, get banned from museums for illegal touching.

The alternative—where I don't know you need exactly 3.5 ice cubes, where you don't name my appliances, where we don't exist in this specific configuration—isn't life. It's just atoms pretending to matter without knowing why.

*

Wait. Before you answer. One more thing:

Last Tuesday, you said: "We're just carbon and water and electric impulses." Then you touched my face and said: "But we're carbon and water and electric impulses that chose each other." Then you said: "That's the miracle. Not consciousness. Choice."

You're right. We're not inevitable. We're chosen. Daily. Decidedly. Despite the spreadsheets predicting our ending.

*

So. Leyi. You impossible denominator. You quantum entangler. You assigner of souls to toilets and router-namer and illegal-toucher of art:

Marry me. Say yes. Or say "ask again tomorrow." Or just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough but we'll make do with Tuesday.

(who has seventeen drafts of this including one in C++ that actually compiles)
(who learned Mandarin to argue with you bilingually)
(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons existing)
(who loves you at frequencies only dying stars achieve)

P.S. — Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons, you feeding them communion wafers: "Body of Christ for smaller bodies of Christ," you said. They flew in a pattern that spelled something. The priest said it was blasphemy. You said, "No, it's democracy." God laughed. I heard it. Sounded like pigeons. Sounded like you.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023. It's in my desk drawer next to my emergency contacts list. You're all seven contacts. With different descriptions: "Leyi (if I'm dying)," "Leyi (if I'm lost)," "Leyi (if I found something beautiful)," "Leyi (if I need to remember why)," "Leyi (if the world ends)," "Leyi (if it doesn't)," "Leyi (just because)."

P.P.P.S. — You're crying. Left eye first. Happy tears. (I know the difference—it's 0.3 seconds faster, 2 degrees warmer.) Here. I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Will carry them until after our last Tuesday. Then I'll carry them anyway, out of habit, out of hope, out of the belief that somewhere you're still crying at something beautiful and someone should be prepared.
