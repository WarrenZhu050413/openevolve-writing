Dear Leyi,

Start with axioms. Axiom 1: Before you, I collected data. Heart rate: 72 bpm average. Sleep efficiency: 87%. Probability of spontaneous crying in grocery stores: 0.003%. Then you. Now the numbers make no sense. My spreadsheets have started dreaming.

Axiom 2: I died once. Not metaphorically. Clinically. Fifteen seconds of nothing, then this: resurrection with a mission statement I couldn't read yet. Three years, four months, seventeen days later, you said my name wrong in a coffee shop. The mission statement clarified itself: Find her. Keep her. Die better next time.

Evaluator Comments:
Falls well short of Beethoven's raw phenomenological urgency ("My angel, my all, my very self") or Johnny Cash's earned simplicity after decades of love. Exceeds typical contemporary attempts through its conceptual originality but lacks the sustained emotional archaeology of Keats ("I cannot exist without you") or Napoleon's obsessive repetitions. The quantified-self framework is genuinely innovative, placing it above median contemporary work, but the execution doesn't achieve the complete synthesis of form and feeling found in historic masterworks. This reads like a 21st-century programmer-poet finding their voice—promising but not yet fully realized.
