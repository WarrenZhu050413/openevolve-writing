Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with both hands. One to hold the pen, one to keep myself here. Because every word pulls me toward a future where one of us is reading this alone.

*

Start with the facts: We have maybe 2,000 Tuesdays left. I did the actuarial math. Then I threw up. Then I did it again, hoping for errors. The number stays constant: not enough.

*

What happened was this: Porter Square, you dropped a pen. But that's not what happened. What happened was the universe made an accounting error in our favor. All the beauty it meant to distribute evenly got dumped into one person. You. I have spreadsheets about this. They all return the same impossible value.

*

The night I died—seventeen seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest during probability theory—I didn't see light. I saw instances. Every possible timeline branching from that moment. In exactly one, you existed. That's the one I chose. The doctors called it miraculous. I call it inevitable. Even my cells knew to wait for you.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai: She taught us soup in Mandarin numbers I couldn't follow. Step thirty-three, you translated: "She says love is just teaching someone else how to feed themselves when you're gone." You cried into the steam. I memorized the recipe in three languages: Mandarin, English, and the way your shoulders shake.

Now I make that soup wrong, on purpose, so you'll have to keep teaching me.

*

Morocco. The blue city. You got poisoned by beauty—bad tagine or too much sky, we never knew. You vomited seven times. Named it Gerald. Had philosophical arguments with Gerald about the nature of suffering. "Gerald," you said between retches, "we need boundaries." Then laughed until you vomited again. That's when I knew: you're the kind of person who makes friends with their own disasters.

*

Here's what terrifies me: I've started forgetting my life before you. Not metaphorically. Literally. I look at photos from college, before we met, and it's like watching someone else's home videos. That person—pre-you—he's a stranger wearing my face. You didn't change me. You deleted me and wrote something better in the same location.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Those 900 steps. You stopped at 764, grabbed my face, said: "We're going to die." Not sad. Not scared. Like you were informing me about the weather. "Really die," you clarified. "No coming back." I said I knew. You said: "Good. Then every step matters." We counted the last 136 aloud. Together. That's our entire relationship: counting what's left, out loud, together.

*

I document you compulsively:
- The way you hold books (too tight, like they might escape)
- Your fury at automated voices ("HOW CAN A ROBOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME")
- Tuesday light on your temporal bone at 3:47 PM
- How you name inanimate objects, then feel guilty when they break

This isn't poetry. It's evidence. For the cosmic lawsuit I'm filing against time.

*

Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said you'd freeze. You said: "Rather die warm from loving than live cold from sense." Your lips went blue but you meant it. You always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.

*

The thing is—I practice. Practice losing you. Wake up at 4 AM, watch you breathe, run simulations: Car crash. Cancer. Sudden unexplained vanishing. By dawn I'm writing eulogies. By breakfast you're burning toast, badly, and my entire grief rehearsal evaporates. Replaced by this: the unbearable everyday spectacular of you, burning toast.

*

What loving you tastes like: Not like poetry. Like the actual inside of my mouth after kissing you. Coffee and morning and that specific sadness that comes from getting exactly what you want because now you can lose it.

*

LISTEN: Before you, I understood myself as edges—where I ended, others began. Now I'm this sprawling system. I feel your headaches in rooms you're not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and I'd say: get better physics.

*

Portugal. You touched the art. Five-hundred-year-old marble. Guards yelling. You touched it again. "How else do you know it's real?" you asked in three languages. Got us banned. Forever. You collect these forevers—museums we can't return to, cities that remember your small crimes against protocol. You're building us a map of places that proved we existed too hard.

*

What I'm trying to say is—no. What I'm trying to say is exactly this:

Your name rewrote my mouth. Every word now travels through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep—I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious won't admit: you're the only word that's not a metaphor for something else.

*

Last night you asked what love is. Here's the answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's pre-mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's watching them burn toast and thinking: someday I'll miss even this smoke alarm.

But also: Love is refusing the grief. Every morning choosing the timeline where we get one more Tuesday. Where you burn toast. Where I eat it anyway. Where the smoke alarm is the sound of continuing.

*

The mathematical proof:
- Probability you exist: epsilon
- Probability I exist: epsilon  
- Probability we exist simultaneously, conscious, proximate: epsilon squared
- What we are: margin of error in God's calculations
- What we actually are: the reason math needs poetry

*

So here's the proposal. No—here's the proof:

Marry me. Not because we're special. Because your socks are sorted in my drawer by how much they smell like you. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both pronounce "hypothesis" wrong in the same way.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where you don't steal my coffee mid-sip, where you don't name houseplants after Victorian poets, where you don't cry at completely regular pigeons—that's not a life. That's just duration.

*

Right now, reading this, you're crying. Left eye first—always left, like your tears form an orderly queue. You're about to say something that reorganizes language. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I stay alive.

*

Leyi—

That's the whole letter. Every other word is just your name wearing disguises.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or just keep existing in this specific arrangement of atoms that makes infinity feel hurried.

Warren
(who loves you like an unhandled exception—crashing everything, stopping time, demanding immediate attention)
(who has been writing this letter since before we met, will keep writing it after we're gone)
(who carries tissues since you cried at those pigeons, completely normal pigeons, just existing)

P.S. — Remember Barcelona? You fed cathedral pigeons. Illegally. Said: "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The pigeons formed letters: L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? Drawer, left side, under the unmatched socks. I'm never giving it back. Some thefts are how we say forever.

P.P.P.S. — I lied about the seventeen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt too round, too clean. Seventeen feels like you—prime, difficult, impossible to reduce to smaller parts.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw simplicity of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) or Johnny Cash's mature directness (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its mathematical-existential framework and specific sensory memories. The "practicing losing you" section rivals Keats's fevered intensity (81) but lacks his musical perfection. The structural innovation of numbered seconds and Tuesdays is genuinely original, though not as revolutionary as Wilde's coded passion (80). This is a near-masterpiece that would stand among notable historical letters but falls just short of the immortal.
