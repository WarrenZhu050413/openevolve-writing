Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my left hand. My right one won't stop shaking. Not metaphor. Medical fact. Started the day I met you.

*

Three things happened when you entered that room:
1. My amygdala misfired
2. Time developed a stutter
3. I understood why humans invented the word "inevitable"

The doctor says it's benign essential tremor. I say it's my atoms trying to reorganize themselves in your direction. We're both right.

*

I need to tell you what you don't know:

Thursday, 2:47 AM: I practice your funeral eulogy. Have for three years. Version 47 begins: "She argued with trees about photosynthesis and was always right." Version 198 just says your name for twenty minutes. Both feel insufficient.

I've written goodbye letters dated ten, twenty, forty years from now. Hidden them in books you'll read when I'm gone. Page 247 of your Portuguese dictionary. Page 18 of that recipe book you never open. Insurance policies against my absence.

This isn't morbid. This is love with a spreadsheet.

*

You asked for truth? Here: I've been mapping you like a genome.

The way your voice drops half an octave when lying (rarely). How you eat sandwiches counterclockwise. That you count stairs in Portuguese but everything else in English. The scar behind your ear from chicken pox, age seven, that you think no one notices.

I notice everything. It's pathological. Last week I found myself cataloguing the rate your nail grows (0.1mm/day, slightly faster on your ring finger). I've become a forensic scientist of you.

*

In Morocco, you taught that street vendor calculus. In exchange for mint tea.
In Scotland, you sang to Highland cows. They followed us for miles.
In Shenzhen, you fixed my grandmother's radio with a hairpin and pure spite.

Each memory weighs exactly 21 grams. The weight of a soul, they say. I'm carrying 31,536 souls. All yours. Different versions from different Tuesdays.

*

Here's what terrifies me: I love you like a chronic condition. No cure. Progressive. Terminal.

Some mornings I wake up and the first thought is your name and the second is panic because what if today is the day you realize I'm just a collection of anxieties in a Harvard sweater who writes your name in condensation on windows like a teenager with a crush that metastasized into marriage.

But then you steal my coffee. Three sips. Always three. And physics makes sense again.

*

The math of us, recalculated:

Your existence × my existence = statistical impossibility
Your grandfather's immigration papers + my mother's delayed flight + that broken elevator that made you take the stairs = cosmic architecture
The probability of finding someone who debates ethics with chatbots and cries at time-lapse videos of flowers blooming = 0.0000001%
What we built from that = this impossible Tuesday where you're reading over my shoulder making that sound that means you're about to cry or laugh or both

*

I document everything because I'm building a backup. Not of you—of us. For the universe where one of us goes first.

Directory: /memories/leyi/
- subfolder: "laughs" (247GB)
- subfolder: "Wednesdays" (infinite loop)
- subfolder: "the way light works differently on your face" (corrupted from overuse)
- subfolder: "things you said while sleeping" (encrypted, password: the way you mispronounce "worcestershire")

*

Last week you asked why I check your pulse while you sleep. Here's why: because your heartbeat is the only sound that makes my nervous system believe in permanence. Because I'm memorizing the rhythm for the decades when it stops. Because love is just fear wearing its best dress.

*

I tried to calculate how many breaths we have left together. The number made me violent. Made me want to storm whatever office runs time and demand extensions, file appeals, bribe whoever's in charge with whatever they want.

Twenty thousand days if we're lucky. Seven million breaths. Maybe eight million if we move somewhere with better air.

It's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.

*

So here's my proposal: Let's fail at forever together.

Let me love you wrong for the next sixty years. Too much on Tuesdays, not enough on Thursdays, sideways on weekends. Let me continue this documentary of us until my handwriting deteriorates and my memory corrupts and the only word left is your name.

Marry me because your toothbrush already knows my secrets. Because we've survived my attempt at cooking and your family's questions and Boston winters where the only warm thing was your hand finding mine in the dark.

Because I've already lived the alternate timeline where we don't exist to each other, and it's not living. It's just atoms pretending to have purpose.

*

You're crying. Left eye first, as always. Your tears have a pH of 7.4. Slightly alkaline. I looked it up. I look everything up. I'm building a encyclopedia of you because when the universe tries to take you back, I need evidence you were real.

*

Final confession: That tremor in my right hand? It's not medical. It started that Tuesday you walked in wearing my grandmother's cardigan you'd found at the back of my closet. You'd fixed the missing button. With a different button that somehow matched better.

My hand shook because my body understood before my brain: Oh. There she is. The person I'll never recover from.

Three years later, it still shakes. Writing this. Writing your name. Writing our future in present tense because past and future are just punctuation marks and you—

You're the whole sentence.

*

Say yes. Or say no. Just say it in that voice that makes my atoms believe in God or chance or whatever algorithm was kind enough to crash us into each other.

But know this: I've already said yes. In this timeline. In all timelines. In the timeline where we're strangers, I'm still saying yes to you.

Warren
(who has loved you since before consciousness, will love you after language fails, loves you in the present tense that exists outside time)

P.S. — The tremor's getting worse as you read this. It knows you're about to say yes. My body's already celebrating. My brain's just catching up. That's always been our rhythm—you happen, then I understand.

P.P.S. — We have a minute of silence before you answer. I'm memorizing it. The last moment before our forever officially begins. It sounds like your breathing. Like home. Like the only prayer I remember how to say.
