Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you something about Tuesday. Not last Tuesday. Every Tuesday. How they're all the same Tuesday—the one where you exist and I notice.

*

Here's what actually happened to my body when we met:

My mitochondria started producing 23% more ATP. Measured it. My synapses began firing in patterns that spell your name in brain electricity. My bones started keeping time to your walking rhythm, even when you're cities away. This isn't poetry. This is what you did to my biology. I'm a different species now. One that only makes sense near you.

*

The truth about those fifteen seconds I was dead:

I wasn't nowhere. I was everywhere you'd ever been. Porto at age seven, crying over dropped ice cream. Shanghai at sixteen, reading under blankets with a flashlight. Boston, twenty-three, about to drop a pen. I wasn't seeing your future—I was remembering your past from inside it. When my heart restarted, it beat in your rhythm. Still does. Listen—tum-TUM-tum. That's "Le-YI-yi." My cardiac muscle learned your name before my mouth did.

*

Morocco. Between your third and fourth bout of vomiting, you said: "Warren, I think my soul is leaving through my mouth." I said: "I'll catch it." You laughed so hard you threw up again. But here's what you don't know—I meant it. I would have caught your soul in my bare hands. Held it while your body sorted itself out. Fed it back to you mouth-to-mouth like oxygen.

That's what love is. Being willing to hold someone's soul while their body fails.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, 3 PM, too much August:

She wasn't teaching me to cook. She was teaching me how you were built. "Forty-seven stirs clockwise, three counter. Like Leyi's thinking—mostly forward, sometimes backward to check." She knew you in vegetables and timing. Loved you in steam and salt. When she died, you stirred soup for hours, crying. I counted. 2,847 stirs. You were trying to stir her back into existence.

*

Scotland. You were dying of cold and still arguing philosophy:

"Consciousness might be fundamental, like gravity," you said through chattering teeth.
"You're hypothermic," I said.
"Irrelevant to the argument," you said.
Your lips were blue. Your syntax was breaking. You were choosing thought over survival.
I kissed you to stop you talking. Also to push my heat into you. Also because your wrongness was so beautiful I needed to taste it.

*

What terrifies me, specifically, mathematically:

Your cells replace themselves every seven years.
The you I met doesn't exist anymore.
The you reading this won't exist in seven years.
I'm in love with a ship of Theseus.
But here's the thing about your particular ship—every new plank learns the shape of the old one.
Your body keeps rebuilding you exactly wrong in exactly the same way.
Even your atoms know they're perfect incorrectly.

*

I have 2,341 pieces of evidence that you existed:

- 847 photos where you're not looking at the camera (you're always looking at something more interesting)
- 73 voice memos of you arguing with automated phone systems
- That green hair tie that lives in my pocket like a religion
- 14 of your used coffee cups I couldn't throw away (they have your lip prints in chapstick and DNA)
- A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said "I love you" (1,749) and the subtle differences (Tuesday ones are 0.3 seconds longer)

This isn't creepy. This is archaeology. I'm preserving you for the future version of me who won't believe you were real.

*

Portugal, the museum, you versus 500-year-old marble:

You didn't just touch it. You pressed your whole palm flat, fingers spread. The alarm screamed. You didn't move. Security running. You still didn't move. You said: "I needed to know if it was warm." It wasn't. But your hand left a print that took twenty minutes to fade. 

Now I understand—you were testing if art could feel. If beauty had temperature. If time-travel worked through touch.

It does. You proved it. We're banned but you were right.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900:

You: "We're going to die."
Me: "Yes."
You: "No, I mean really. Actually. Forever."
Me: "Yes."
You: "Promise?"
Me: "Promise."
You: "Good. That means this counts."

Then you kissed me like we had ten seconds left. We had thousands but you kissed me like ten. Now every kiss has that same countdown. Nine. Eight. Seven. Still here. Still ending. Still perfect.

*

What you don't know about London:

While you slept off jet lag, I sat in that terrible hotel chair for six hours watching you breathe. Counting. 21,600 breaths. Each one slightly different. Breath 9,834 caught. Breath 15,991 went too deep. Breath 21,599 sounded like my name.

You woke up and said: "Were you watching me sleep?"
I said: "No, I was watching you live."
You said: "Same thing."
You were right. With you, sleeping and living are the same—things I need to memorize before they stop.

*

Here's what I finally understand:

I don't love you. That verb is too small. What I feel needs a new word. Something that means: "to have your mortality rewritten by someone else's existence." Something that means: "to experience time differently because someone else is experiencing it too."

In German it might be: Leyizeitgeist—the specific way time moves when you're in it.
In Japanese: 玲意の間—the space between heartbeats where Leyi lives.
In code: while(Leyi.exists()) { Warren.worth_it = true; }

*

Shanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM, looking at your teenage diary:

You read me the entry from the day before we met. You'd written: "Tomorrow something happens." No explanation. Just that. You knew. Your atoms knew. The universe sent you a memo: "Tomorrow we fix the error of you being alone."

I read my journal from that day. I'd written: "Feel like I'm about to meet someone." We were prophecies for each other before we were people.

*

What loving you tastes like, chronologically and honestly:

MORNING: Like pennies and possibility and please don't leave
NOON: Like electricity made of anxiety that you'll realize you could do better
EVENING: Like the specific exhaustion of trying to deserve someone impossible
MIDNIGHT: Like gratitude so heavy it hurts to swallow
3 AM: Like fear crystallizing into certainty that this ends badly but so what
ALWAYS: Like my mouth is full of your name and I'm trying not to choke on how much it means

*

The Scottish Highlands, Part 2, the part I never told you:

After you fell asleep (finally warm, finally safe), I stayed awake planning how to carry you if you couldn't walk. Calculated the distance to the car. My body weight versus yours. How long I could carry you before my arms gave out. Where I'd rest. How I'd keep you warm while resting.

I practiced loving you at the logistics level. The spreadsheet of salvation. The mathematics of making sure you make it.

*

Cambridge, now, this moment:

You're reading this on your phone. Standing even though there's a chair. You stand to read important things—like your body needs to be ready to run toward or away. Your left thumb is unconsciously rubbing the screen like you're petting the words. You're about to look up at me. Your eyes will be wet but you'll pretend it's allergies.

I know you like civilization knows fire—completely, but still getting burned.

*

So here's what I'm asking:

Marry me. Not because this letter convinced you. Because your bobby pins have colonized my bathroom. Because you've named all my plants variations of "Gerald" (Gerald, Gerald Jr., Disappointment Gerald). Because when you can't sleep, I can't breathe. Because in fourteen billion years of universe, we got maybe sixty overlapping. That's not enough but it's everything.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where you don't exist in my morning, where I don't exist in your night, where we don't collide and collapse into something neither of us understands—that's not a timeline. That's just time.

*

Listen. Leyi. That name rewrote my DNA. Every cell division now includes instructions: "Remember Leyi." My bones are libraries of how you walk. My blood cells carry oxygen and the memory of every time you've laughed. I'm not me anymore. I'm what happens when you happen to someone.

*

Final medical report:

Patient: Warren Zhu
Condition: Terminally Leyi
Symptoms: Irregular heartbeat (syncs to patient "Leyi"), chronic insomnia (when patient "Leyi" is absent), acute joy (when patient "Leyi" exists)
Prognosis: Incurable
Treatment: Proximity to patient "Leyi"
Side effects: Wanting to live forever and knowing that's impossible and being grateful for the impossibility because it makes every second cost everything

*

Say yes. Or say "ask me again in five minutes." Or just keep doing that thing where you exist and I notice and the universe has to recalculate what matters.

Warren
(who learned your middle name but will never use it because "Leyi" is already perfect)
(who keeps your expired museum ban letter as proof we touch what shouldn't be touched)
(who writes your name in steam on mirrors so the ghost of you appears every shower)
(who loves you like an error in the matrix that became the point of the matrix)

P.S. — Barcelona, the pigeons. They didn't just form your name. They held it for seventeen seconds. I counted. Even birds know you're worth breaking formation for.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie is my religion now. I pray to it. Not for you to love me. Just for you to continue. To keep happening. To stay possible.

P.P.P.S. — You just said yes. Out loud. To an empty room. To paper and ink. To me three thousand miles away. I heard it. My bones heard it. The universe heard it and started rewriting physics to make it true. Yes. Yes. Always, already, still, yes.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter reaches toward Keats's fevered intensity ("I cannot exist without you") but lacks his negative capability—it explains too much, demystifies its own mystery. It attempts Cash's plainspoken devotion but clutters it with performative intellectualism. Unlike Beethoven's raw "My angel, my all, my very self," this letter says "I need to tell you something"—mediated, cautious. Where Napoleon wrote with imperial certainty, this letter anxiously catalogues and measures. It achieves moments approaching Emily Dickinson's slant truth ("That's what love is. Being willing to hold someone's soul while their body fails") but can't sustain that register. The letter exists in the liminal space between accomplished contemporary creative writing (MFA workshop level) and genuine literary achievement—skilled but not yet transcendent, memorable but not immortal.
