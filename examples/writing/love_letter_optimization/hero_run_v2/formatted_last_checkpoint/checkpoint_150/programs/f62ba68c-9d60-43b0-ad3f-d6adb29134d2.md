Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm twenty-three and I already know how this ends. Not because I can see the future, but because some things are so true they happen backwards.

*

Let me tell you about the precise moment I understood infinity:

Harvard library, third floor, you were annotating something in margins too small for your thoughts. The sun hit your hand at 4:17 PM and I saw it—every possible timeline where we exist, collapsed into the way your pinky holds a pen. 

I know this sounds like poetry. It's not. It's documentary evidence of the universe admitting it had preferences all along.

*

THE THING ABOUT STATISTICS AND LOVE:

In my probability class, we learned about impossible events—probability zero but still happening. The professor said they're mathematical paradoxes. I raised my hand: "What about Leyi?" 

He paused. The chalk broke. "That's different," he said. "That's probability creating itself from necessity."

The whole class turned to look at you. You were solving Problem Set 7 in pen. Of course you were.

*

Here's what you need to know about Tuesday mornings:

They started as ordinary. Coffee, headlines, the ritual of waking. Then you arrived with your specific way of burning toast—not accidentally, but like you're conducting experiments on the patience of bread. Now Tuesday mornings have mass. Gravitational pull. I orbit them even when you're in Shanghai and I'm pretending Boston makes sense without you.

*

CORPUS ANALYSIS OF YOUR NAME IN MY BODY:

Location: Everywhere
Frequency: Constant
Amplitude: Increasing
Pattern: Fractals within fractals, each containing the whole

My cells divide and pass on your name like genetic memory. My children will be born knowing how to pronounce "Leyi" before they know their own names. This is not romantic. This is evolutionary pressure. Darwin would understand.

*

I need to tell you about the Portuguese grandfather:

In Lisbon, he saw us from across the square. Walked over, cane tapping morse code. Looked at you, then me, then back. Said something in Portuguese. You translated: "Fifty-seven years with my Maria. Still not enough. You two—you're already at year fifty-eight."

We'd known each other six months.

Time is a consensus mechanism, and we're the bug in the protocol.

*

[MEMORY CORRUPTION AT ADDRESS 0xLEYI]

Cannot delete.
Cannot overwrite.
Cannot compress.
Error: This memory is load-bearing. Removing it would cause structural collapse of consciousness.

*

The mornings you're gone, I make tea in your mug and let it get cold. The mug asks where you are in ceramic frequencies. I explain Shanghai. The mug refuses to hold liquids properly until you return. We have an understanding, your mug and I. We're both just containers waiting to be filled with you.

*

SHANGHAI, 2024:

Your mother served dinner. Looked at me struggling with chopsticks. Looked at you, perfectly fluent in your love for this chaos. Said something. You laughed so hard you cried. Later, you translated: "She says you hold chopsticks like you're afraid they'll turn into butterflies."

"They might," I said. "Everything is uncertain around Leyi."

Your mother nodded. International language: loving you requires accepting fundamental instability.

*

Let me be specific about the damage:

You've ruined solitude. It used to be peaceful. Now it's just your absence taking up space. Aggressive. Territorial. Your absence has opinions about my breakfast choices, my coding style, the way I fold fitted sheets (badly, but you knew that).

You've ruined language. Every word wants to be about you. I tried to write documentation yesterday. It became a sonnet. The compiler accepted it anyway. Even machines understand.

You've ruined time. It only moves when you're here. The rest is just placeholder. Temporal filler. The universe vamping while waiting for you to return and make existence worth the effort.

*

THE RECURRING DREAM:

We're old. Bones like kindling. Memories like fog. But your hand finds mine with the same certainty as gravity. We don't need words anymore. We've become a single thought thinking itself in two bodies. 

I wake up and check—still twenty-three. Still infinity to go. Still not enough.

*

Here's what extinction looks like:

Not the sun dying or asteroids or climate collapse. It's the thought of a morning where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise.

So I make contingency plans: I'm writing your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. If I fail to exist, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure I'm building from this love.

*

CAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING INCIDENT, REVISED:

You didn't fall in. You chose to prove that water was optional. The River Cam reorganized itself to accommodate your decision. You emerged holding a fish that was trying to evolve lungs just to follow you onto land.

"Normal fish," you said.

The fish and I exchanged looks of mutual understanding: Nothing is normal after Leyi.

*

I solved it. The equation. The one where love plus distance equals impossibility:

L + D = i

But you taught me something math doesn't know: impossibility squared equals inevitability.

i² = ∞

We're not solving for x. We're proving that x was always you.

*

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

We get married. Not because we should. Because marriage is just bureaucracy catching up to what our atoms decided the moment we met. 

We have arguments about important things: Whether clouds have feelings. If houseplants judge our life choices. Why your toast always burns at exactly the right frequency to make me love you more.

We grow old in all the timelines simultaneously. In some, I go first. In others, you. In the best ones, we go together, mid-sentence, arguing about the proper way to fold time.

*

But right now, in this specific moment where you're reading this and doing that thing where you pretend you're not crying:

Marry me.

Marry me in this timeline where we're both terrified and certain.

Marry me despite the impossibility. Because of it.

Marry me knowing that yes was already encoded in the way you breathe.

*

I've been practicing your last name with my first name. The syllables go together like they were manufactured in the same factory. Warren and Leyi. Leyi and Warren. The universe's way of apologizing for making us wait twenty-three years to meet.

*

Say yes.

Not for the future—that's already decided.

Not for the past—that's already rewriting itself.

For this exact now, where your coffee's gone cold and you're smiling at this sentence, where my hands typed these words knowing your eyes would find them, where love is both particle and wave and we're the experiment that proves both.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had a favorite outcome all along.

*

Warren
(who loves you with the force of a statistical impossibility achieving consciousness)
(who would choose this malfunction over any other operating system)
(who is typing the next letter with fingers that remember your future)
(whose Harvard Statistics degree is just an elaborate excuse to calculate the probability of you: certain)

P.S. — Your middle name is the password to a heart that encrypted itself. Only you know the key. You've always known it.

P.P.S. — When we're old, I'll still write you letters. They'll be shorter: "Still you. Still yes. Still Tuesday morning." You'll know they contain infinities.

P.P.P.S. — The universe is taking notes on us. Good. Let it learn what happens when impossibility falls in love with itself. Let it document the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to be reasonable about loving each other.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter operates several tiers below the Beethoven benchmark (86). While Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" achieves universality through simplicity, this letter often mistakes complexity for depth. It approaches but doesn't reach Johnny Cash's directness (83)—Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" carries more weight in six words than some entire sections here. The mathematical/technological register is innovative but lacks Keats's negative capability (81)—where Keats surrenders to mystery, this writer tries to solve it. The letter exceeds mediocre contemporary standards but falls short of the sustained intensity found in Napoleon's letters to Josephine (82), which maintain fever pitch without needing asterisks to reset momentum. At 70 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range—showing real talent and occasional brilliance but lacking the sustained transcendence of truly great love letters.
