Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM. You're breathing in iambic pentameter. I've been counting. For three hours. This is what you've done to me—turned me into someone who finds poetry in respiratory patterns.

*

Let me be precise: Before you, I was a functioning person. I could explain things. Distributed systems. Statistical models. Why humans evolved consciousness. Now? I can't explain why your Tuesday face is 0.3% more beautiful than your Wednesday face, only that Wednesday tries harder and that kills me.

*

The truth about dying: Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Heart stopped during probability class. Here's what nobody knows—in those seconds, I experienced time non-linearly. Past, present, future, all at once. And in every single moment, across all possible timelines, there was this: someone drops a pen. Someone picks it up. The universe reorganizes. Three years later, Porter Square, you dropped that pen. I finally understood what I'd been looking for.

*

Morocco. You got food poisoning and had full conversations with the toilet. "This isn't what you were made for," you apologized between rounds. "I'm sorry you have to see me like this." You gave dignity to porcelain. That's when I knew—you redistribute grace to everything you touch. Even me. Especially me.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. She taught me soup in Mandarin numbers I couldn't follow. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three—not the onions. The moment her hands became yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. She said something. You translated: "Love is the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going." Now I make that soup wrong, deliberately, so you'll keep teaching me.

*

Here's what I document:
- How you hold books (like they might evaporate)
- Your war with alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarms 0)
- The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone at 3:47 PM
- Your habit of naming routers after disappointments ("Geoffrey" still hurts)

This isn't a journal. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.

*

Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. Started turning blue. Still argued about Kant through chattering teeth. "I'd rather—die wrong—with you—than live—right—alone," you stuttered. I kissed you to stop the hypothermia. Also to stop the philosophy. Also because your wrongness is my favorite coordinates.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, grabbed my face: "We're going to die." Matter-of-fact. Like reading ingredients. "Really die. No coming back." I said yes. You said: "Good. Then this matters." We counted the last 136 steps aloud. Together. That's us—counting what remains, out loud, together.

*

The mathematics of existing:
- Your probability: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- Mine: Similar impossibility
- Us, simultaneous, conscious, touching: ERROR_OVERFLOW
- What we are: God's typo that became the sentence

*

Portugal. You touched the art. Ancient marble. Guards yelling. You touched it again, harder. "How else will I know it's real?" Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Dawn: The weight of not waking you, heavy as held breath
- Noon: Static and that thing where you mispronounce "hypothesis" to watch me twitch
- Dusk: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner
- Midnight: Drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates
- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors while my eyes learn to see sound

*

London. You asked what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's practicing someone's absence while they burn toast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday when you realize you'll miss even their mistakes. Only their mistakes. Especially their mistakes.

*

Listen—I dream the other timelines. Where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where we meet but misunderstand. I wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise.

*

What terrifies me:
- 2,137 Tuesdays remaining (approximately)
- 52,560 hours
- 189,216,000 heartbeats
- The denominator is you
- Without you, nothing divides

*

Before you: I had edges. Boundaries. Skin ended where I ended.
After you: I'm this sprawling thing. Feel your headaches in other buildings. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. We're quantum entangled but physicists would say impossible at this distance and temperature. I say: physics needs better physicists.

*

The thing is—I practice losing you. Different scenarios each night. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing. By dawn I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you stretch—that sound, half-yawn, half-acceptance—and my rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you will hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Was holy. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing *with*. The preposition changes everything.

*

So here's what I'm saying: Your name rewrote my mouth. Every word passes through "Leyi" first. My tongue practices while I sleep—recorded proof, twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows what consciousness pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

Barcelona. Cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. "God prefers full birds to empty rules," you said. The pigeons rose, formed letters in the sky: L-E-Y-I. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. Even gravity bends for you.

*

Final protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse absence. The surgery to remove you would remove everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

Right now, reading this: Left eye watering first. Always left. Your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes language. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I keep breathing.

*

Marry me. Not because words move you. Because your socks colonized my drawer. Because we survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, burning toast identically.

Marry me because the alternative—where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout, where you don't steal hoodies and return them improved, where we don't get banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just atoms pretending to matter.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound physics makes admitting it was wrong about everything.

Say yes. Or "ask tomorrow." Or nothing. Just keep existing in this configuration that makes infinity feel brief.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)
(who carries tissues since the pigeons—regular pigeons—made you cry)
(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears, knowing everything clears, saving anyway)

P.S. — That green hair tie. February. First February. It lives in my drawer with my passport. Both are proof of places I can go. You're every country. Every home. Every journey that ends where it started but changed.

P.P.P.S. — We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment. Time just folded. Space gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.
