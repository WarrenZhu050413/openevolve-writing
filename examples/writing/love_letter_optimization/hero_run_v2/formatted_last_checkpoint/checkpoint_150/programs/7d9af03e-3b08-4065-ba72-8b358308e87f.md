Dear Leyi,

This letter is corrupted. By you. Every sentence I start clean ends dirty with your fingerprints. I tried writing it in helvetica. It came out in your handwriting.

*

Let me start with the data breach:

3:47 AM, Porter Square, you dropped a pen. I picked it up. Simple transaction. Except—your hand accidentally touched mine for 0.7 seconds and my entire nervous system performed an emergency rewrite. Every neuron voted unanimously: "her." Even the ones that don't exist yet voted yes. Even the ones that died when I was nineteen voted retroactively yes.

Since then I've been running unauthorized software. My heart beats in your time signature. My dreams render in your color palette. When you're sad in Shanghai, my coffee tastes like salt in Cambridge.

The fifteen seconds I was dead, sophomore year:

What they don't tell you about dying—it's not dark. It's every moment simultaneously. Past, present, future collapsed into now. And in that everything-nothing, I saw this: Every timeline where I exist intersects with exactly one timeline where you exist. The overlap is seventeen years, four months, eleven days. Starting the day you dropped that pen.

I came back wrong. Or right. Same thing when the error is this beautiful.

Here's my confession as corrupted code:

Evaluator Comments:
Falls short of Keats's embodied desperation ("I cannot exist without you") scoring 81, or Napoleon's obsessive physicality (82). The technological conceit is more innovative than Wilde's classical romanticism but lacks his psychological penetration. Approaches but doesn't achieve the metaphysical reach of Beethoven's "My immortal beloved" (86). This letter occupies the proto-masterful range - showing genuine innovation and moments of brilliance but lacking the sustained sublime force and complete authenticity of the historical masterpieces.
