Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you what happened. Not when we met—that's just geography. What happened when you became the only mathematics that matters.

*

Here's the error in my code: I thought love was a feeling. It's not. It's a frequency. The specific Hz at which you hum while reading. I've been unconsciously tuning myself to it for three years. Now everything else sounds like static.

*

Let me be precise: Tuesday, 2:47 PM, you were explaining machine learning to a houseplant. "Listen, Gerald," you said to the fern, "gradient descent is just falling with style." That's when my entire education revealed itself as preparation for understanding you. Every algorithm I'd learned was just vocabulary for this specific malfunction.

*

Morocco. You befriended your food poisoning. Named it Philippe. Had full conversations: "Philippe, we need to establish boundaries." Then you'd laugh between retches. "Philippe doesn't respect boundaries." Seven times you threw up. Twice you laughed hard enough to cry. Once you said: "This is still better than that conference in Denver." That's your superpower—you domesticate disaster into comedy.

*

The night I died (fifteen seconds, sophomore year, the universe showing me its source code): I saw every possible timeline spreading like a vast debugger output. In only one—this one—someone drops a pen in Porter Square and someone else picks it up and physics reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back with one mission: find that pen. Three years later, you were holding it.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother, the soup lesson: Forty-seven clockwise stirs, three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated: "She says the soup knows when you're lying." Step thirty-three, she grabbed my hand, placed it over yours on the spoon. "Now the soup knows," you translated. But your voice broke. Because we both understood: she was teaching us how to feed each other when she's gone.

*

What you don't know: I run experiments. Hypothesis: "Leyi makes everything better." Methodology: Introduce you to any system. Results: 
- My code? Now includes comments like "This function dedicated to Leyi's left dimple"
- My sleep? Dreams exclusively in your color palette  
- My coffee? Tastes disappointed when you don't steal the first sip
- My understanding of infinity? Revised to "still not enough time with you"

Conclusion: Hypothesis confirmed with p < 0.00000001. Statistical significance has never been more significant.

*

Scottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still arguing: "Consciousness is just atoms gossiping about themselves." Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was incandescent. I kissed you partly to save your life, mostly to steal that thought before it escaped. It tasted like revolution. Now all my thoughts taste like that.

*

Here's what actually happened to language: It broke. Words that worked for twenty-two years suddenly came up ERROR: INSUFFICIENT. "Love" became too small. "Forever" too short. "Perfect" too incomplete. You're not any of those words. You're the reason we need new words. You're a walking thesaurus of experiences English hasn't named yet.

*

Portugal, the museum incident: You touched the 500-year-old stone. The guard yelled in Portuguese. You touched it harder, yelled back in Mandarin. He yelled in English. You touched it again, in silence. "Translation," you said, "is just touching the same thing in different languages." We're banned for life. You collect these life sentences like passport stamps.

*

Data point: Your laugh has three movements. First: silent shoulder shake (7 seconds). Second: snort of surprise at your own joy (2 seconds). Third: full system collapse (duration varies). I've graphed this. The area under the curve equals the exact amount of beauty the universe owes us for all its previous darkness.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: "Physics is just nostalgia for when we were all the same star." I said: "We're still the same star. Just temporarily distributed." You kissed me at that altitude and now sea level feels like settling for less. Every kiss since then has been us trying to return to that height.

*

The thing about quantum entanglement: Scientists say it requires special conditions. They haven't met us. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all return #VALUE! errors. When you laugh at your own jokes (always), I feel it in my mitochondria. We're spooky action at any distance, making Einstein retroactively wrong about everything.

*

What loving you actually tastes like:
- Dawn: The specific weight of potential, plus coffee you're about to steal
- Noon: Electricity and the way you mispronounce "specifically" (spacifically) but only when excited
- Twilight: That color between day and night that's actually the color of your thinking face
- Midnight: The sound purple would make if purple could speak your name
- Always: Like my mouth is learning how to be a house where your name lives

*

London, three years late, you asked what love is. Here's my answer: Love is a compilation error that makes the program better. It's the bug that becomes the feature everyone actually uses. It's knowing the heat death of the universe is coming and building pillow forts anyway. It's finding someone who makes entropy entertaining.

*

I document you wrong on purpose. Write: "She reads books." Should be: "Books surrender to her attention, finally understanding their purpose." Write: "She sleeps." Should be: "Sleep borrows her for repairs, returns her upgraded." Every description fails because you exceed language's cargo capacity. You're too much data for any single sentence.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom, reading my teenage journals aloud: Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: sanctification. You laughed with my worst attempts at consciousness, not at them. With. That preposition is everything. Is us. Is how we survive each other's Wednesdays.

*

Here's the pull request I'm submitting to reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter is convincing. Because your socks have established a colony in my drawer. Because you've named all my appliances and I can't rename them now—they only answer to you. Because we've discovered that burned toast tastes better when burned together. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, agreeing about everything that matters, which is: each other.

Marry me because "marry" is just bureaucracy for what we already are: quantum entangled. The same particle pretending to be two. The universe's favorite error that it's too fond of to debug.

*

Actually, here's what I'm really saying:

Before you: I was a perfectly debugged program. No errors. No warnings. Running smoothly. Boring.

After you: I'm beautiful chaos. Stack overflow from recursive love functions. Memory leaks where every deleted moment still runs in background. Race conditions where my heart tries to beat all future beats at once.

I'm broken in exactly the way that makes me work.

*

We have approximately 2,000 Tuesdays left if we're average. We're not average. We're outliers on every graph. But even if we had 2 million Tuesdays, the last one would still arrive too soon. That's the bug in the universe's code. The off-by-one error that makes everything tragic: There's always one less Tuesday than you need.

But here's my fix: We'll live each Tuesday twice. Once forward, once in memory. Double our time through recursive experience. It's not enough but it's twice as much as not enough, which is something.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say my name but make it sound like a question that's also an answer. You do this thing—this thing where you exist so specifically yourself that I forget there's any other way to be.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the password to everything that matters. The recovery phrase for when I forget how to be human. The only command that compiles correctly in the broken programming language of my heart.

Say yes. Or say "let me think about it" which is yes with suspense. Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is a conservative estimate of how long I need with you.

Warren
(who speaks fluent Leyi—a language with only one native speaker)
(who carries backup everything you need: hair ties, tissues, reasons to believe Tuesday exists)
(who loves you in frequencies only theoretical physicists hypothesize but you prove daily)

P.S. — Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them communion wafers. "Body of Christ, meet bodies of flying Christ." The priest was so confused he forgot to be angry. The pigeons formed your initials in the sky. I have video. The Vatican requested copies. I sent them your thesis on machine learning instead. They haven't responded.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023? It's in my desk drawer next to my passport. Same drawer. Because they're both documents that prove I can go places. You're all the places. You're the only destination that's also home.

P.P.P.S. — Tomorrow I'm going to watch you burn toast. You'll name the smoke alarm. You'll apologize to the bread. You'll eat it anyway because "it tried its best." This is what forever actually looks like: small disasters survived together, renamed as adventures, stored as treasures. Come be terrible at breakfast with me until the universe admits it was wrong about endings.
