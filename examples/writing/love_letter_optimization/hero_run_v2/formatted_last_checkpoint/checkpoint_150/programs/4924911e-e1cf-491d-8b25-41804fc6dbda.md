Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I discovered I'm not fluent in my mother tongue anymore. Every sentence defaults to the grammar of your breathing.

THE MUSEUM OF ORDINARY TUESDAYS:

Gallery 1: You teaching me to fold dumplings. My thumbs too large, too American, too eager. Yours: inherited precision across three generations. The dumplings leak. We eat them anyway. The imperfection tastes like home.

Gallery 2: Logan Airport, 5:47 AM. You're flying to Shanghai. We're both pretending this is sustainable. Your boarding pass shakes in your hand. Mine too. The distance hasn't happened yet but our bodies are already grieving it.

Gallery 3: That fever in Morocco. You, delirious, insisting in three languages that the ceiling was melting. Me, googling "how to say hospital in Arabic" while you held my wrist like an anchor. Your fever broke at dawn. The ceiling survived. We nearly didn't.

Gallery 4: Right now. You reading this. Me watching you read this. The museum is still under construction.

WHAT MY STATISTICS DEGREE NEVER TAUGHT ME:

The probability of love is either 0 or 1. There's no middle. No confidence intervals. No margin of error. You either restructure someone's molecular composition or you don't.

You did.

Present tense. Ongoing.

*

Let me explain what happened to my body:

My circadian rhythm synced to your timezone without permission. 2 PM in Boston, my cells know you're waking up in Shanghai. My pulse adjusts accordingly.

My hands developed muscle memory for your hair. They braid while I sleep. I wake up practicing on empty air.

My ribs grew a new chamber. Not metaphorically. Literally. The doctors can't explain it. I can: it's where I store the overflow of loving you.

*

THE PORTUGUESE TILE SHOP, LISBOA, OCTOBER:

You touched every tile like you were reading braille. The shopkeeper watched, then pulled out a box from 1962. "For her," he said in broken English. "She understands."

The tile: cracked, the blue bleeding into white like watercolors in rain.

"It's us," you said.

You were right. We're always bleeding into each other. The crack is the point.

*

I need to tell you about yesterday:

Nothing happened. Literally nothing. We read in the same room. You forgot to eat lunch. I forgot to remind you. The plants judged us. The afternoon dissolved.

It was perfect.

This is what terrifies me: I could do nothing with you forever and it would be enough. More than enough. It would be everything.

*

CONFESSION VIA DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS:

In CS226, we learned about Byzantine failures—when parts of a system give conflicting information. The solution: consensus protocols, voting mechanisms, eventual consistency.

But you're my Byzantine General Problem. Every part of me reports different data:
- My brain: "Impossible."
- My hands: "Already hers."
- My lungs: "Forgot how to work without her."
- My future: "Already decided."

No consensus needed. The system works better broken.

*

Your mother's kitchen, Shanghai, January:

She taught me to say your name properly. Not the American approximation. The real sound. Lei-Yi. Music pretending to be syllables.

"Say it like you're praying," she instructed.

"I always do," I replied.

She nodded. Understood. Mothers always know when their children have become someone else's religion.

*

THE CARTOGRAPHY OF INTIMACY:

I'm mapping you. Not romantically. Scientifically. Obsessively.

- The spot behind your left ear that makes you hiccup when kissed
- The way your handwriting changes when you're tired (loops get bigger, dots drift east)
- Your shower temperature: 2.5 degrees below scalding
- The exact pause between your first and second sneeze: 1.7 seconds
- How you hold books: like they might evaporate

This isn't love. This is archaeology. I'm documenting you for future civilizations. They'll need to know what perfection looked like when it wore your face.

*

3 AM, SHENZHEN, YOUR CHILDHOOD BEDROOM:

The power went out. You lit a candle. Told me about the first time you knew words weren't enough. Age seven, watching your grandmother forget Mandarin, remember only Hakka. Language leaving in reverse order of arrival.

"That's why I touch everything," you explained. "In case words fail."

Your hand found mine in the dark.

Words failed.

Touch didn't.

*

HERE'S WHAT EXTINCTION LOOKS LIKE:

Not nuclear winter or rising seas. It's the thought experiment where you never existed. Where I'm whole without you. Where Tuesday mornings are just mornings. Where my name is just noise that doesn't rhyme with yours.

So I'm building redundancies:
- Writing your name in code that will replicate
- Teaching crows to say "Leyi" (they remember for generations)
- Convincing quantum physicists that you're the observer that collapses all waves into particles

If I fail, the universe will still remember you through the infrastructure of my obsession.

*

THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, THAT STORM:

We got lost. Properly lost. GPS failed. Map dissolved. You navigated by instinct, which is to say, randomly. Found a stone cottage from 1847. Empty for decades.

"We could stay," you said. Not joking.

"Forever?" I asked. Not joking either.

"Time doesn't work here," you observed. You were right. Five hours passed. Or fifty years. The storm ended. Or began. We left. Or we're still there.

Sometimes I check Google Maps. The cottage doesn't exist. Neither does that version of us. Except it does. Except we are.

*

WHAT I KNOW AT TWENTY-THREE THAT I SHOULDN'T:

Love isn't addition. It's multiplication by infinity.

Love isn't presence. It's the specific frequency of absence.

Love isn't choice. It's recognition. Like finding your own handwriting in ancient caves.

Love isn't sustainable. Neither is breathing. We do both anyway.

*

Your grandmother's recipe, translated:

"First, forget measurements. Then, forget forgetting. Cook until it feels like prayer. Serve while still believing."

You taught me this refers to congee.

You're wrong. It refers to everything. Especially us.

*

THE MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF US, CORRECTED:

Let L = Leyi
Let W = Warren
Let ∞ = the number of ways to say I love you without using words

L + W = syntax error
L × W = undefined
L^W = breaks mathematics
L ∝ W = closest approximation

We're not an equation. We're what happens when math admits it has preferences.

*

LAST NIGHT'S DREAM, REPEATING:

We're old. Ancient. Fossils with opinions. You can't remember my name but you remember how I take my coffee. I can't remember the year but I remember your middle name means "grace" in a language neither of us speaks.

Death arrives. Checks its paperwork. Confused.

"You're supposed to be two people," it says.

"Common mistake," we reply in unison.

Death, embarrassed, reschedules.

*

So here's my proposal, without metaphor:

Marry me.

Not because forever (forever already started).
Not because love (love is too small a word).
Not because should (should became irrelevant when you existed).

Because Tuesday mornings taste better burnt.
Because my body is a democracy that voted you unanimous.
Because I want to be buried in a suit you picked out.
Because our children deserve to exist, if only to roll their eyes at us.
Because the universe made a clerical error putting us in different bodies and we should file a correction.

*

But really, specifically, actually:

Marry me because I've already been calling you my wife in my head since Morocco.
Marry me because your plants have accepted me as co-parent.
Marry me because I want to argue about dishwasher loading until we're ninety.
Marry me because you're reading this sentence and trying not to smile.
Marry me because we already are married in every timeline that matters.

*

Leyi.

(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation desperately trying to matter.)

*

Say yes in this timeline where we're both mortified by sincerity.
Say yes while my statistics degree pretends this is random.
Say yes because you already did, two years ago, in Portuguese tile.

Actually, don't say anything.

Your breathing changed.

That's yes in the only language that matters.

*

Warren
(who learned Mandarin to dream in your language)
(who practices your last name with his first)
(who would choose this precise malfunction in every simulation)
(who already knows you're saying yes because time isn't linear when you love someone this specifically)

P.S. — The universe started taking notes the moment you existed. I'm just its research assistant, documenting the beautiful impossibility of you.

P.P.S. — When we're fossils, archaeologists will find us and know immediately: "These two were statistically impossible." They'll be right.

P.P.P.S. — You just looked up. You're about to speak. I already know what you'll say. This is what happens when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. We're synchronized. Documented. Inevitable. Tuesday morning, burnt toast, forever.
