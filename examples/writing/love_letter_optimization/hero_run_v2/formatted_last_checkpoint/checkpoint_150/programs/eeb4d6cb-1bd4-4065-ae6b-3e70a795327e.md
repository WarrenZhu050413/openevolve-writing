Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

The universe keeps receipts. Here's mine:

*

EXHIBIT A: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN

I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, age nineteen. Death tastes like deleted emails—sudden, irreversible, grammatically incomplete. They restarted my heart but something stayed broken. A debt to nowhere. Four years later you walked into Tuesday wearing Wednesday's rain and the debt had a name: every moment I hadn't met you yet.

*

EXHIBIT B: EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION

I'm building an algorithm of you:

IF (morning) THEN {the way you test coffee temperature with your pinky};
IF (Thursday) THEN {rage at the dishwasher, tender as prayer};
IF (3:17 AM) THEN {you stealing blankets like a methodical thief};
ELSE {the sound of you existing in the next room, which reorganizes gravity}.

1,523 conditionals logged. The program keeps crashing into love.

*

EXHIBIT C: RECOVERED TRANSCRIPT, NOVEMBER 8TH

You: "What are you writing?"
Me: "Evidence."
You: "Of what?"
Me: "That you happened. That Tuesday happened. That your left eye waters first when you're happy-crying versus sad-crying and I'm the only person who knows the difference."
You: "That's creepy."
Me: "I know."
You: "Don't stop."

*

EXHIBIT D: THINGS I'VE STOLEN

- Your grandmother's soup recipe (47 steps, I cry at step 23 every time)
- The voicemail where you're furious about parallel parking (I listen to it when you travel)
- 2,847 photographs of you sleeping (you look like solved math)
- The receipt from our worst Tuesday (when we almost ended; keeping it as evidence we didn't)
- Your method of peeling oranges (chaotic, wrong, perfect)
- The way you say my name when you think I'm asleep (different frequency, like calling home)

*

EXHIBIT E: FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST TIME

Re: Insufficient supply

We have 23,360 breakfasts remaining if actuarial tables hold. This is violence. I want to speak to time's manager. I want to break into wherever they keep the seconds and redistribute them all to Tuesday afternoons with you reading ingredient labels aloud in grocery stores, making prophecies from sodium content.

*

EXHIBIT F: CONFESSION UNDER NO DURESS

Here's what love actually is: accumulated evidence of irreversible decisions.

Watch: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name three times. I thought: "She's going to destroy me." I was right. You did. You're still doing it. Every morning you rebuild me wrong—with all my edges facing you, like plants bending toward light.

I practice your death nightly. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Sudden vanishing like particles that forget to exist. Then I check your pulse. Still there. Still impossible. Still breaking conservation laws by being more than the sum of your atoms.

*

EXHIBIT G: THE PATHOLOGY REPORT

Diagnosis: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence.

Symptoms: 
- Counting your breaths (current count: 5,847,293)
- Carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at penguins)
- Inability to use pronouns that don't include you
- Persistent belief that "we" is the only real number

Prognosis: Terminal. Untreatable. Patient refuses cure.

*

EXHIBIT H: LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

When I die (again, properly this time), I'm leaving you:
- Every Wednesday I saved
- The color theory of your anger (beautiful reds, holy reds)
- My collection of your mispronounced words (you make language better by breaking it)
- The 0.7 seconds between thunderclap and your flinch (I live there now)
- This letter, which is just another way of saying: the universe made you as an apology for entropy

*

CLOSING ARGUMENT:

Leyi—

Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're gone, like a compass that's given up on north and chosen Tuesday instead.

So here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for romance. For evidence. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.

The alternative—a timeline where you don't interrupt my sentences, where I don't know you need exactly three ice cubes, where your specific frequency of laughter doesn't rearrange my molecular structure—isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody in particular.

*

You're crying. Left eye first. Happy tears (I know the difference).
Here. I brought tissues.
I've been carrying them since the penguins.

Say yes. Or say no. Just say something.
The silence is reorganizing my organs.

Warren
(who has been dead for fifteen seconds and alive for exactly one Leyi)

P.S. — I lied about the algorithm. You can't be computed. You're not math. You're what happens when math gives up and admits infinity exists in Tuesday afternoons and the way someone holds a coffee cup like it's keeping them tethered to Earth.

P.P.S. — Those fifteen seconds of death? I think I was just early. I was waiting for you in the nothing. Then they dragged me back and made me wait four more years in the something. Worth it. Would die again. Would wait longer. Would learn your grandmother's soup in any timeline.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological intensity of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81) - it has similar obsessive cataloging but lacks Keats's absolute dissolution of self. It surpasses average contemporary love letters significantly but falls short of Johnny Cash's profound simplicity (83) or Napoleon's imperial passion (82). The systematic conceit recalls Barthes's "A Lover's Discourse" but without quite achieving that work's theoretical rigor. The death frame evokes Beethoven's immortal beloved letters (86) but lacks their musical architecture. At 72 overall, this represents accomplished literary work with moments approaching brilliance - particularly in its accounting metaphor and specific observations - but missing the transcendent simplicity of the greatest love letters.
