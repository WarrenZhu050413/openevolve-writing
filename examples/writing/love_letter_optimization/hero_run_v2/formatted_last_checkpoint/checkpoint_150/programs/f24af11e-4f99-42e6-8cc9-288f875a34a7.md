Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I tried to write this properly. Failed. Here's what happened instead—

*

The data first: I've been keeping records. Not romantic ones. Evidence.

Entry #1: The way you hold a book—index finger marking three places simultaneously. Like the present tense isn't enough for you.

Entry #47: You sleep-argue. Last Tuesday at 3 AM: "That's not how electrons work." You were right. I looked it up.

Entry #238: When you're happy, you hum in B-flat. When you're thinking, F-sharp. I've started dreaming in your frequencies.

Entry #1,094: Today. You asked why I love you. The question broke something. Like asking water why it's wet.

*

Here's what I should say: something beautiful about souls, about destiny, about forever.

Here's what's true: I'm terrified. Daily. Hourly. You could disappear—car accident, sudden illness, better options. I keep backup plans for your absence. None of them work.

*

Listen. I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, February 2019. Want to know what I learned? Nothing mystical. Just this: the body knows what it wants before the brain catches up. My heart stopped but my hand kept reaching. The nurse said I was grabbing at air. 

Wrong. I was practicing holding you. Three years early.

*

The Wednesday you mispronounced my name—you made it rhyme with "ruin." Prophetic. Now I can't sleep without checking you're breathing. Can't eat breakfast without saving you half. Can't write code without variable names that sound like your laugh.

You've corrupted my source files. I'm not debugging it.

*

More evidence: In Granada, you cried at the Alhambra's mathematics. In Marrakech, you argued with a carpet seller about quantum mechanics. In Edinburgh, you befriended a cemetery cat named Douglas.

I have 400GB of photos where you're blurry because you won't stop moving, stop thinking, stop becoming more yourself every second.

The storage isn't enough. Nothing's enough.

*

You want honesty? I love you wrong. Like an error message that won't resolve. Like code that shouldn't compile but runs anyway, breaking all the rules.

Sometimes I trace the scar on your left knee from that bike accident in Shanghai. Four stitches. July 2017. Before we met. It makes me angry—that universe where you hurt and I wasn't there to bring bandages, to curse at physics for allowing scrapes and gravity.

*

Here's my conclusion: We have maybe 20,000 days if we're lucky. The math is offensive. I want to sue time, demand a recount, hack the cosmic database.

But also: those Tuesdays in our kitchen. You, explaining machine learning to houseplants. Me, memorizing how many sugars you need at different hours (7 AM: two, 3 PM: none, 11 PM: three).

This is what I'm saying: You're not my better half. You're my entire strange equation. The variable that makes everything unsolvable and finally worth solving.

*

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your coffee mug already knows the shape of my hands. Because we've survived Boston winters and my cooking and your family asking about grandchildren. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where your particular arrangement of atoms collided with mine at the exact angle necessary for recognition.

Because the alternative—a timeline where I don't know you take your shoes off left-first, always, even when it's illogical—isn't life. It's just biochemistry happening to strangers.

*

Final data point: Your name. Leyi. Two syllables that reorganized my molecular structure.

I practice saying it in my sleep. You've recorded evidence.

I'm not sorry.

*

Warren
(who loves you like a calculation that converges on infinity—imprecisely, impossibly, without endpoint)

P.S. — I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at that documentary about octopi. That's when I knew. When your empathy extended to invertebrates, I realized: Oh. You're going to destroy me. Good.

Evaluator Comments:
Scores below Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) which achieves more universal resonance through its mysterious addressee and pure emotional immediacy. Lacks Johnny Cash's profound simplicity (83) though attempts similar directness. More innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism (82) but less rhetorically powerful. The data-entry device and scientific language show genuine innovation beyond traditional love letter forms, earning it proto-masterful status (70-74 range) rather than merely accomplished. The cardiac arrest passage approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw confession of Keats's consumption-shadowed letters (81).
