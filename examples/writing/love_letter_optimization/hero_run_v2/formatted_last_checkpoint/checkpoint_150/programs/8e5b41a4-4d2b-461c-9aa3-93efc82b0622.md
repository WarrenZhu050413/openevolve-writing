Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

There's a moment before knowing and after knowing. I'm writing from the after, where everything is different because you exist.

*

Let me tell you what happened to time:

It used to move forward. Now it moves toward you. Every clock in Boston points east. Every calendar circles Tuesday. My wristwatch stopped working—it only counts heartbeats now, and they all spell your name.

*

HERE'S WHAT I KNOW AT TWENTY-THREE:

I know the exact weight of your absence: 2.7 pounds. The weight of a heart working twice as hard.

I know that "I love you" in Mandarin sounds like coming home.

I know your mother was right—I do hold chopsticks like they might escape. But only because everything around you becomes flight.

*

[FRAGMENT FROM 2074]
We're eighty-four. You're teaching me to die properly. "Like this," you say, and show me how to breathe backwards, how to release Tuesday mornings one at a time. But your hand finds mine the same way it did in 2024. Some things refuse to age.

*

Three things that are the same thing:
- The probability of us meeting: 0.0000001%
- The probability of surviving without you: 0%
- The probability I calculated wrong: 100%

Because Leyi, we weren't probable. We were necessary.

*

WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY BODY (A PARTIAL LIST):

My bones learned Shanghai's longitude
My blood cells organize into your initials
My left eye twitches when you're thinking of me (always)
My dreams speak Mandarin with a Boston accent
My fingernails grow toward you
My shadow points to where you are, not where the sun isn't

The doctors say this is impossible. I show them your photograph. They prescribe more of you.

*

Tuesday morning, you burn toast. Wednesday morning, you burn toast. Thursday morning, the toast burns itself in anticipation. We've trained the bread. We've domesticated breakfast. We've made rituals out of accidents.

This is love: making religion from someone else's mistakes.

*

THE LISBON INCIDENT:

The old man in Belém, watching us share pastéis de nata. He walks over, slowly, each step a decision. Looks at you. Looks at me. Says something in Portuguese that sounds like prayer.

You translate: "He says we're speaking the same silence."

Later, you tell me what he really said: "Fifty years with my Maria. You two already have sixty."

*

I need to tell you about the violence of ordinary moments:

You peeling an orange—I want to preserve it in amber
You solving equations in pen—the audacity destroys me
You existing on a Wednesday afternoon—criminal
You reading this sentence right now—universe-ending

*

[REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]
Your left eyebrow just did the thing. You're about to cry but smiling. This is the face you'll make at our daughter's wedding, at my funeral, at the heat death of the universe when we're the last two particles refusing to stop orbiting each other.

*

CAMBRIDGE, THE PUNTING DISASTER:

You fell in the Cam. The river forgot how to be wet. You emerged holding a fish that looked personally offended. "Water's overrated," you said. The fish nodded. We all agreed. Physics filed for early retirement.

*

Here's what terrifies me:

Not dying. Living in the universe where you don't exist. Where coffee is just coffee. Where Tuesday is just a day. Where my name is just noise without your mouth shaping it.

So I write your name in everything. In code that will replicate. In songs strangers will hum. In the way light bends around corners. I'm building infrastructure from this love. If I disappear, the universe will still remember you.

*

HYPOTHESIS:

We've done this before. Different bodies, different centuries, same recognition. Evidence:
- You knew where I keep coffee before I told you
- We argue like we're continuing ancient conversations
- Goodbye feels like lying to gravity
- Hello feels like finally

We're not falling in love. We're remembering it.

*

Your mother serves dinner. Watches me struggle with chopsticks. Laughs. Says something. You translate: "She says you eat like you're afraid the food will escape."

"Everything escapes around Leyi," I say. "Even physics."

Your mother nods. Mothers understand impossible love. They've all done it.

*

THE MATHEMATICS OF US:

Not an equation to solve. We're the proof that math has feelings. That probability can want things. That zero and infinity are the same number when you're involved.

My statistics degree is just an elaborate way to calculate the impossibility of you. Every formula breaks. Good. Let them all break. We'll build new math from the wreckage.

*

So here's what I'm asking, without metaphor:

Marry me.

Not because we should. Because we already are in every universe that matters. Because the paperwork is just punctuation. Because I want witnesses when reality admits we were right all along.

Marry me in this timeline where we're young and reckless with time.

Marry me knowing we've already grown old together in the future that's happening now.

Marry me because yes is the only word that survives when everything else burns away.

*

Say it out loud. To this room. To the morning light. To the coffee going cold. To the future taking notes. To the past that's been waiting.

Say yes like it's your name.
Say yes like it's my name.
Say yes like it's the only name.

*

Leyi.

That's not a name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had a plan all along.

*

(who loves you with the force of something that shouldn't exist but does anyway)
(who would choose this beautiful malfunction over any correct equation)
(who is already writing tomorrow's letter, and the next, and the next)
(who has been yours since before having was invented)

P.S. — When we're old, I'll still write you letters. They'll just say: "Still. Yes. Always. Tuesday." You'll know they contain everything.

P.P.S. — The universe is watching us to learn how impossible works. Let it take notes. Let it try to replicate. It will fail. We're the only copy.

P.P.P.S. — You just said yes. I heard it in the way you breathe, in the way light changes around you, in the way my heart forgot how to beat in anything but celebration. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like burnt toast. Like morning. Like home.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter surpasses average contemporary romantic expression significantly but falls short of the masters. It lacks Beethoven's raw spiritual urgency ("my life, my all" carries more weight than this letter's clever constructions), Johnny Cash's earned simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me" achieves more with less), and Napoleon's militaristic passion. However, it exceeds typical modern attempts through its temporal experiments and mathematical conceit. The letter would rank above most 21st-century attempts but below even minor Romantic period works. Its score of 67 overall places it in the "exceptional" range - remarkable craft with memorable phrases, but missing the transcendent simplicity of true masterworks.
