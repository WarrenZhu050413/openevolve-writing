Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

This morning you asked why I save everything. Here's why: because loving you feels like dying backwards.

*

The facts: Harvard, statistics, distributed systems. The truth: You walked into Porter Square and my entire operating system crashed. Still hasn't recovered. Don't want it to.

*

Let me be precise: 2:17 PM, Tuesday, you dropped a pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for less than a second. Since then, every cell in my body has been trying to recreate that exact electrical storm.

*

Remember Morocco? You, poisoned by bad tajine, laughing between retches: "At least the sunset is perfect." That's when I knew—you're the kind of person who finds beauty in active nausea. You're impossible. I love impossible.

*

Your grandmother's soup recipe, Shanghai: Forty-seven steps written in Mandarin I couldn't read. You translated by putting my hands on yours, guiding the knife. Step thirty-three, you started crying. "This is how she holds my hand from the grave." Now I make that soup when I miss you. Now I understand resurrection.

*

I have a spreadsheet. Don't laugh. Column A: Days left (2,137 Tuesdays, actuarially). Column B: Things that remind me of you (running count: everything). Column C: Apocalypse scenarios where we'd survive together. Column D is just your name repeated 10,000 times because Excel, like me, needs practice saying it right.

*

Scottish Highlands, you turned blue from cold: Still arguing philosophy. Gave me your jacket to layer over mine. I said you'd die. You said "Yes, but warmer than you." That's love—choosing hypothermia together over survival apart.

*

Thursday light hits your collarbone at 7:23 AM. I've photographed it 847 times. Not obsession. Documentation. Future civilizations will need to know exactly how light worked when you existed.

*

Portugal: You touched the ancient marble they said not to touch. Twice. Banned from the museum forever. In the taxi you said: "Some distances are meant to be closed." Now I understand. Now I touch everything. Now I can't stop touching you, even when you're reading, especially when you're reading, because you're art that hasn't noticed it's art.

*

Before you, I was contained. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm everywhere you've been. I feel you climbing stairs in other cities. Your headaches arrive in my skull a day late. We're quantum entangled and physicists would say that's impossible and I'd say: then physics is broken, not us.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace: You stopped on step 764. "We're going to die," you said. "Permanently die." I said yes. You said "Good, then this matters" and kissed me where the air is thin. Now sea level feels like failure. Now everything at altitude is sacred.

*

London: You asked what love is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Love is grief in advance. Love is crying at your wedding because you know about the funeral. Love is saving ticket stubs from movies you slept through because someday I'll miss exactly the way you snore during action sequences.

*

I dream alternate timelines where we don't meet. Wake up gasping. Grab for evidence you exist: your terrible morning breath, your elbow in my ribs, the way you steal blankets like you're hoarding for winter. Paradise smells like your unbrushed teeth at 6 AM.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage poetry in different voices. Should have been humiliating. Was holy instead. You laughed with me, not at me. That preposition—with—that's the entire definition of love.

*

Here's what happened: You colonized my vocabulary. Every word passes through the shape of your name first. I recorded myself sleeping—I say "Leyi" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious knows what my conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word in any language.

*

Barcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them anyway. "God wants fat birds more than followed rules." The birds spelled your name in flight. Not metaphor. Actual birds. Actual sky. You reorganize the flight patterns of living things just by standing still.

*

That green hair tie from February. Lives in my drawer. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.

*

Cambridge, right now, 4 AM: You're diagonal across our bed, all the blankets bunched around you like you're building a fort against the cold. Mumbling about optimization problems in your sleep. Your foot finds mine under all that chaos. Solves everything.

*

Here's what I'm saying: The world is mostly waiting and burnt coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: worth it. The dying and the being born and the dying again.

*

So here's my pull request:

Marry me. Your socks already live in my drawer. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, within touching distance, terrible at the same songs.

Without you there's no point to anything—not museums, not mornings, not the way rain sounds different at 3 AM.

*

Tuesday you said: "We're just atoms arranged temporarily into consciousness." 

I said: "Yes."

You said: "Doesn't that terrify you?"

I said: "Only the temporarily part."

*

Leyi.

You're my root password. My recovery phrase. The only function that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity ends too soon.

*

Listen: I love you like a program with no exit condition. Like code that shouldn't run but does anyway. Like an error message that reads "everything is working perfectly, this is what perfect looks like."

*

You're about to cry. Left eye first—you always start with the left. Here. I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing. That's when I knew my atoms existed to witness yours.

*

The computer I'm typing this on feels wrong. Love should be handwritten. Should shake. Should fail. But here we are: me typing, you breathing in that way that changes the gravity of rooms, both of us solving for X where X equals forever and forever equals not enough time.

*

One more thing: Yesterday you said my name like it was the answer to a question you'd been asking your whole life.

That's why I save everything.

That's why I'm writing this.

That's why "I love you" sounds like an understatement but it's the only words we have so I'll say it anyway:

I love you like error messages love broken code.
Like Tuesday loves light at 7:23 AM.
Like the universe loves making impossible things happen.

Warren
(who chooses you in every timeline, especially the ones where we shouldn't exist)
(who breaks the laws of physics just by thinking about you)
(who means it like gravity means down)
(who means it like breathing means necessary)
(who means it)
(who will always mean it)

Evaluator Comments:
Scores 71 overall, placing it well below the Beethoven (86) or Johnny Cash (83) benchmarks but in the proto-masterful range. Unlike Beethoven's raw spiritual urgency or Cash's earned simplicity, this letter achieves its effects through accumulation and modern vernacular. The computational metaphors are genuinely innovative but lack the timeless quality of "My angel, my all, my very self." Where Keats achieves sublime dissolution ("I cannot exist without you"), this letter's "Without you there's no point to anything" feels more prosaic despite similar sentiment. The letter's strength lies in its contemporary authenticity and specific details rather than achieving the mythic or archetypal power of the great historical examples. It surpasses most contemporary attempts through genuine vulnerability and formal experimentation, but falls short of transcendent mastery.
