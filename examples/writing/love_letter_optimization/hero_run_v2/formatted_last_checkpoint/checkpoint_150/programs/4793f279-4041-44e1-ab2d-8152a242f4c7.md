Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. Not poetry. Just the physical consequence of trying to contain something infinite in a finite body.

*

Here's what happened: I catalogued everything. Not for romance. For evidence in case reality tries to deny you existed.

Entry #1: You pronounce "Wednesday" with all the letters. Wed-nes-day. Like you're salvaging the parts other people throw away.

Entry #764: You apologize to furniture when you bump into it. The coffee table knows more "sorry"s than I do.

Entry #1,263: Yesterday. You found a dead moth. Gave it a funeral in a matchbox. Said: "Everything deserves a witness." That's when I understood—you're not human. You're what humans were supposed to be before we learned disappointment.

*

The truth about time: It's not linear when you love someone. I'm simultaneously five years old meeting you for the first time in thirty years, and ninety watching you die yesterday, and right now holding your hand which is somehow all hands you've ever had—baby fat, teenage anxious, adult confident, elderly tissue-paper.

I experience you in past-perfect-future tense. "Will have been loving." There's no grammar for this.

*

Shenzhen, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Didn't speak. Just moved my hands with hers. Forty-three ingredients. I cried into the pot. She said the salt was perfect. Later you told me she hadn't cooked since father died. We taught each other resurrection through vegetables and silence.

*

I've been calculating: We breathe 23,000 times per day. 8,395,000 per year. If we're lucky—sixty years—that's 503,700,000 breaths. It's not enough. I need you to breathe infinitely. I need your lungs to outlast the heat death of the universe.

This is mental illness. It's also the only sane response to loving someone made of calcium and hope.

*

Cambridge, Trinity College, you solved an equation on a napkin that had been unsolved for decades. Then used the same napkin to blow your nose. This is you: accidentally brilliant, purposefully human.

*

What loving you tastes like at different hours:
- 6 AM: The first word invented before language
- Noon: Static between radio stations where God hides
- 4 PM: The specific weight of light through amber
- Midnight: How cells feel when they remember they're mostly empty space
- 3 AM: The sound purple would make if purple could scream

*

Morocco, the desert: You made me stop the car to move a turtle off the road. It bit you. You bled. You moved it anyway. Said: "Everything's just trying to get home." I wanted to tell you then: You're my home. But home is too small a word. You're my entire address system. My GPS coordinates. My reason for having a location at all.

*

Here's what terrifies me: I love you prophetically. I know exactly how you'll look dying. The Tuesday morning when you're eighty-three, making tea, and your heart forgets its job. You'll say "Oh." Just "Oh." Like death is a small surprise. I'll have six minutes to hold you. Six minutes to explain that my molecules refuse your absence. That I've already negotiated with the universe—it can have me, not you.

The universe doesn't negotiate.

*

Last Tuesday you asked why I count your breaths at night. Here's why: In quantum mechanics, observation changes outcome. If I watch hard enough, maybe you'll keep existing.

This is magical thinking. It's also the only magic I have.

*

Boston, that blizzard: Power out for three days. We built a fort from every blanket we owned. You read me García Lorca by candlelight. In Spanish. I don't speak Spanish. Didn't matter. Understanding is overrated when you can just listen to someone's voice rearranging air into love.

*

The Scottish Highlands, we found that abandoned house. You said: "Imagine the arguments these walls absorbed." Then you kissed me against them, like we were overwriting history with better data.

*

Your grandmother's recipe box: Water-damaged, half Chinese, half memory. You translate them differently each time. "Add love" becomes "add sorrow" becomes "add what's missing." They all taste like home. You're teaching me that translation isn't about words. It's about carrying meaning across impossible distances.

*

Here's my confession: Sometimes I practice leaving you. Pack a theoretical bag. Plan a route to nowhere. Get as far as the door. Then I remember: You keep my toothbrush in a cup you made in third grade. It's lopsided. It's perfect. No one else would keep my DNA in their childhood art project.

I unpack. I stay. I will always stay.

*

Beijing, your father's funeral: You didn't cry until we were flying home. Then you sobbed so hard the flight attendant asked if you were dying. You said "Yes, just slowly." She brought you extra cookies. You ate them all. Grief makes you hungry. I love your hungry grief. I love your full-mouth sorrow.

*

Listen: Before you, I was symmetrical. Balanced. Now I list left—toward wherever you are. My skeleton has developed a bias. My blood flows preferentially to the side of me you last touched.

Doctors would call this pathology. I call it evolution.

*

That night in Venice when you couldn't sleep: You listed every person you've ever disappointed. Took three hours. I listed everyone you've ever saved just by existing. Started with me. Couldn't finish. Dawn came first.

*

Here's what I'm asking: Marry me. Not the idea of me. The actual me who leaves socks in the refrigerator when distracted. Who cries at commercials about insurance. Who loves you like a broken algorithm that keeps outputting "more" when it should output "enough."

Marry the me who knows you eat ice cream when sad but frozen grapes when devastated. Who knows you're afraid of butterflies but not death. Who knows you love me like it's a vendetta against the universe's indifference.

*

We're already married in seventeen dimensions. Our atoms exchanged vows the first time we shared coffee. Our cells signed documents every time we shared skin. Our futures collapsed into one probability wave that peaks at "together" and extends past death into whatever atoms do when they remember what they used to be.

*

Say yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. Your existing in the same timeline is yes.

Everything is yes except no, and you're incapable of no when it comes to us.

We both know this.

We've always known this.

*

Leyi—

That's the only word that matters. The rest is just punctuation explaining why.

(who loves you in languages that haven't been invented yet)
(who is writing this with his non-dominant hand because his right one is still shaking)

P.S. — That tree in Shenzhen where you carved "I will be brave" when you were seven? I went back. Added something in English below it. Won't tell you what. Go look. Take tissues. You'll cry. Left eye first, like always.

P.P.S. — It says "She was." Because you were brave. Are brave. Will be brave. In every tense I can imagine and several I can't. You're brave in the way that atoms are brave for holding together despite the void between them. That's you. Holding together. Despite everything. Brave.
