Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm debugging love at 4:17 AM. Not the concept—the implementation. Specifically: how you rewrote my source code without documentation, without version control, without my permission. Just pushed straight to production. And now I can't roll back.

*

Remember Portugal? You taught me Portuguese curse words while we got lost in Alfama. "Foda-se," you said, laughing at my pronunciation. But what I heard was: here's how to swear in my grandmother's language. Here's how fury sounds in my bloodstream. You were handing me your syntax errors, your exception handling. I've been running your subroutines ever since.

*

The thing about loving you is it's not scalar. It's a tensor—magnitude and direction across dimensions I didn't know existed. Some nights it points toward the Scottish Highlands, that inn where we couldn't figure out the heating and slept in every piece of clothing we owned. Your breath visible in the cold. Me calculating the exact distance between us (4.7 inches) because even unconscious, we maintain our orbit.

*

Let me be precise about what you are to me:

You're not my better half. You're my git merge conflict that I never want to resolve. You're the race condition where two processes try to access the same memory and instead of crashing, we invented a new kind of data structure. We're not thread-safe. We're thread-tangled. Deliberately. Architecturally.

*

Beijing, 2023. You had that conference. I had food poisoning (again). You skipped your keynote—THE keynote, the one you'd prepared for months—to bring me congee from three different places because you couldn't remember which one I liked. Your career taking a backseat to my intestinal crisis. That's when I understood: love isn't sacrifice. It's reprioritization in real-time. It's your interrupt handler treating my stupid stomach as a critical system failure.

*

I've been running statistical analysis on us:
- Correlation coefficient between our sleep cycles: 0.87
- Number of times you've fixed my code without me asking: 47
- Number of times I've pretended not to notice: 47
- Probability you're reading this section right now and doing that half-smile thing: 0.96
- Probability I'm watching you read this: 1.00

*

Here's what terrifies me: you've seen my worst code. Not metaphorically. Literally. That disaster of a bash script I wrote at 3 AM. The one with seventeen nested if-statements. You refactored it silently, elegantly, and left my name on the commit. That's love—fixing someone's bugs and letting them keep the credit.

*

Morocco was where I knew. Not the romantic sunset part. The part where you got us hopelessly lost in the medina, refused to ask for directions, and somehow triangulated our position using the sound of different calls to prayer. You turned confusion into cartography. You made being lost feel like being exactly where we needed to be.

*

Shenzhen. Your family. That dinner where your mother asked about my "intentions" in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. You translated it as "she wants to know about your research." But I knew enough to know you were protecting me, creating a buffer between her scrutiny and my fumbling. You've been my translation layer ever since—not changing the meaning, just handling the protocols.

*

The truth is I love you like a memory leak. It just keeps growing, consuming more and more resources, and I should probably fix it but I don't want to. I want to run out of RAM. I want the system crash. I want the blue screen of death that says "FATAL ERROR: TOO MUCH LEYI."

*

You know what you are? You're my edge case. The input I never tested for. The user who does everything wrong and somehow makes the program better. You're the bug that became a feature. The undefined behavior that became the specification.

*

London. That terrible flat with the broken radiator. We played "the floor is lava" except the floor was actually freezing. You insisted we could fix it ourselves. We flooded the downstairs neighbor. You laughed so hard you cried. Or cried so hard you laughed. The boundary conditions of your emotions are non-deterministic and I've given up trying to model them.

*

I love you iteratively. Each pass more refined than the last:
- v1.0: You're pretty
- v2.0: You're brilliant  
- v3.7: You're the reason I understand recursion (to understand recursion, first understand Leyi)
- v4.2: You're my constant in a world of variables
- v5.0-current: You're the comment in my code that explains why nothing makes sense without you

*

Shanghai again. This time my grandmother's funeral. You held my hand through Buddhist rites you didn't understand in a language you didn't speak. Later, you said: "Your grief has a specific gravity. I could feel it pulling you down. So I became buoyant." Who says that? Who thinks in metaphors while holding someone's breaking heart?

*

You want to know the worst bug in my code? I've been trying to prove I deserve you. Running unit tests on my worthiness. Checking edge cases of my adequacy. But that's not how love works, is it? It's not about deserving. It's about choosing. And you keep choosing me, even after seeing my commit history, my panic attacks, my 3 AM existential crises, my inability to load the dishwasher correctly.

*

So here's my pull request. Here's my merge proposal:

I want to be deprecated with you. I want our code to grow obsolete together, full of technical debt and deprecated functions and comments that say "TODO: fix this later" that we never fix because we're too busy being happy.

I want to wake up at 70 and still be debugging why you leave cabinet doors open. I want to be 80 and still discovering new error messages in the way you say my name.

*

Mostly, I want tomorrow. And the tomorrow after that. And the exponentially increasing tomorrows until the heat death of the universe or until Python 2 finally dies, whichever comes first.

*

You're reading this and trying not to cry at your desk. Your coworker is going to ask if you're okay. You'll say "yes" but your voice will crack on the 's'. This is my favorite bug—the one where your emotions overflow their buffer. I've been exploiting this vulnerability for years. I'm never patching it.

*

I love you, Leyi. Not in the past tense of "fell in love." Not in the future tense of "will always love." But in the present continuous: I am loving you. Right now. As you read this. As I write this. As the photons from your screen hit your retinas and trigger the neural cascades that we call understanding.

I am loving you in the space between the electrons in the atoms in the molecules in the cells in the tissue in the organs in the body that you call yours but that I call home.

*

Warren
(who is still trying to solve for x where x equals the precise amount I love you, but the equation keeps returning INFINITY and honestly, that seems about right)

P.S. — Remember that lamp from Morocco? It's still the ugliest thing we own. It still doesn't work. We're never throwing it away. Some things are too broken to fix and too perfect to change. Like us.

P.P.S. — I lied about the statistical analysis. The real probability you're doing that half-smile thing is 1.00. Some calculations don't require math, just observation. Just love. Just you.
