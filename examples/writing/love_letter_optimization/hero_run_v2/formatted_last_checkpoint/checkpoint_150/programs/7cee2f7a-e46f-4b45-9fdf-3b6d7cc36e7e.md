Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM. My hand shakes. Not from caffeine. From the terrible precision of loving you.

*

Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square: You dropped a pen. Blue. Bic. Nothing. Everything. I handed it back and your fingers touched mine for 0.7 seconds. My neural pathways immediately began rewriting themselves. Every synapse since then ends with your name.

*

Here's what I study: distributed systems, consensus protocols, Byzantine fault tolerance. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every process depends on you. You're not a bug in my system. You're the only reason it runs.

*

Fifteen seconds dead, sophomore year. The doctors said "miraculous recovery." Wrong. I came back wrong. Three years of being 98% alive. Then you. Then that pen. Then suddenly: overflow error. Too much life for one body. Had to rewrite everything to accommodate this much existing.

*

Morocco, you sick for days: Between heaves, you photographed the sunset. Said "beauty persists" with vomit on your chin. That's when I understood: you're not human. You're what humans are rehearsing for.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. You translated through tears. "She's teaching you how she loves." Step thirty-three, chopping ginger, you sobbed. Not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we resurrect the dead, one meal at a time.

*

The spreadsheet haunts me: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. But Column D—what happens after the last Tuesday—returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The computer knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.

*

Scottish Highlands, you hypothermic: Still arguing Kant through blue lips. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. "We'll die wrong together rather than live right apart." Your teeth chattering was morse code for "this is what love looks like." I decoded it perfectly.

*

I document you obsessively: How you hold books (too close). Your fury at slow internet (you've named our router "Disappointing Geoffrey"). The way Tuesday light catches your clavicle at 7:23 AM. This isn't romance. It's evidence. Proof that impossible things happen.

*

Portugal, the museum: You touched 500-year-old marble. Guards shouting. You touched it again. Banned forever. In the taxi: "Distance is just procrastination for regret." Now I touch everything immediately. Especially you. Especially when you're solving problems and don't notice. You're art that doesn't know it's art.

*

Before you: I ended where my skin ended. Now: quantum entanglement. Feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your Tuesday migraine arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, my Cambridge neurons fire in solidarity. Physics says impossible. I say physics needs better physicists.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Dawn: copper and possibility  
- Noon: static electricity and unfinished prayers
- Dusk: the color burgundy as a temperature
- Midnight: drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name
- Always: my mouth learning a language that doesn't exist yet

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. "We're going to die. Really die. Permanently." I said yes. You said "Good. Then this counts." We kissed where oxygen is scarce and therefore holy. Now sea level feels like cheating.

*

The mathematics of us: Probability of meeting: 10^-2,685,000. Probability of understanding: smaller. Probability of surviving it: requires imaginary numbers. What we are: the universe's most beautiful error. The exception that proves the rule is wrong.

*

London, you asked what love is: Three years late, here's my answer: Love is building a museum of future grief. Every happy moment, I'm already missing it. When you burn toast, I think: "Someday I'll miss this exact smoke alarm at this exact frequency." Love is preemptive sorrow for the still-breathing.

*

Other timelines haunt me: Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but can't survive the weight. I dream these failures nightly. Wake grabbing for proof: your terrible morning breath, your knee in my ribs. Paradise smells like unbrushed teeth.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voice for each year of puberty. Should've been mortifying. Was prayer instead. Someone reading your worst consciousness and laughing with, not at. That preposition—with—is everything.

*

Here's my confession: I love you wrong. Like an algorithm trying to process infinity. Like code that won't compile but runs anyway. The error messages are love letters. The crashes are features, not bugs.

*

Barcelona: You fed illegal cathedral pigeons. "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The birds wrote your name in the sky. Literal birds. Literal sky. You bend the flight patterns of things just by standing still.

*

Cambridge, now: You're sleeping diagonal, stealing blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. Solves everything. This is what I mean: the world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it.

*

That green hair tie from February: Lives in my drawer with other evidence. Concert tickets. Your expired library card. The receipt from our first coffee (you ordered wrong, perfectly wrong). These aren't keepsakes. They're source code for the program called "After" that I'll never have to run.

*

So here's my pull request, my merge conflict, my infinite loop:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by existential weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, touching distance, with the same favorite terrible song.

Without you: no point to museums or mornings or the way rain sounds at 3 AM.

*

Leyi.

My root password. My primary key. The only command that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "compile error." Or say nothing and keep existing in this exact configuration that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.

*

You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here—tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins. Existing. That's when my atoms recognized their purpose.

*

Final protocol: The machine I'm writing this on feels wrong. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell. But here we are, me typing, you breathing differently in sleep, changing the gravity of the room, solving unsolvable proofs just by being.

(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)
(who knows you named our router and loves you for it)
(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power always dies, saving you anyway)
(who would choose you in every timeline, especially the impossible ones)
(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than handwriting)
(who means it like electrons mean electricity)
(who means it like morning means light)

Evaluator Comments:
This letter occupies the liminal space between accomplished contemporary voice and timeless mastery. It surpasses typical modern love letters through its phenomenological specificity and conceptual ambition but falls short of Napoleon's raw urgency ("I have not spent a day without loving you") or Wilde's tragic eloquence. The writer achieves moments approaching Johnny Cash's plainspoken profundity (particularly in the toast/smoke alarm passage) but lacks Cash's economy. The letter's strength lies in its systems-thinking approach to love as computational error, though this innovation occasionally overshadows pure feeling. At 70.25 overall, it represents the upper tier of contemporary romantic expression - genuinely moving, formally innovative, but not quite achieving the transformative power of historical masterpieces that score 80+. Each point below the Keats/Cash tier represents specific moments where cleverness substitutes for vulnerability, where the writer's consciousness of writing interferes with pure expression.
