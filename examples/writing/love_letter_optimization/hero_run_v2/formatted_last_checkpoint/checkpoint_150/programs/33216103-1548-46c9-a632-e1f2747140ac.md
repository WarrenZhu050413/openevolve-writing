Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

The universe made a clerical error. Filed you under "person" when you're clearly a loophole in physics.

*

I need to tell you about the math of us:

Your laugh ÷ silence = the only sound that matters
My sanity − you = null set
Our probability of meeting across infinite timelines = 0.0000001%
What we built anyway = everything

I failed calculus twice. Now I understand infinity because it's the minimum unit for measuring what happens to my chest when you exist near me.

*

Here's what loving you has done: I've become a hoarder of microseconds. That pause before you sneeze. The 0.7 seconds your eyes take to find mine in crowds. How you hold chopsticks wrong but right. I'm building an illegal archive of moments the universe hasn't invoiced me for yet.

When they ask me what religion I follow, I want to say: "Tuesday, 9:47 PM, she fixed my collar without breaking conversation."

*

You should know: I practice your absence like a piano piece I'll never master. 2 AM: What if car accident. 3 AM: What if rare disease. 4 AM: What if you wake up sane and realize I'm just a malfunction in a button-down shirt who writes your name in condensation on windows.

But then morning happens and you steal my coffee (always three sips, never four) and the doomsday scenarios dissolve because reality is so much stranger: you chose me. Keep choosing me. Despite evidence suggesting better options.

*

I've been keeping receipts:

- August 3rd: You called me during a panic attack. Not for comfort. To argue about pizza toppings. It worked.
- September 15th: Found you teaching my grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost.
- October 9th: You cried at a butterfly. Said "it's trying so hard to fly." I knew then I'd marry you or die attempting.
- November onwards: [CLASSIFIED - too dangerous for written record]

*

The truth about bodies: Mine was just transportation until you touched it. Now it's a conspiracy of cells that reorganize themselves toward you. My immune system has your name in its whitelist. My skeleton is biased in your direction. Even my allergies take breaks when you're laughing.

Some nights I count your vertebrae like prayer beads. Twenty-four small gods holding you upright. I thank each one.

*

Let me explain what you are: Not metaphor. Not poetry. Evidence that sometimes the universe forgets to be cruel. You're what happens when atoms get ambitious. When carbon decides to be unreasonable. When the Big Bang admits it was just practicing for something better.

You are Tuesday morning coffee and Sunday night silence and that Wednesday you sang to my fever until it broke and I thought: this is it. This is why humans invented the word holy. For moments when someone brings you soup and their hands shake a little and you realize you're witnessing love as an action verb.

*

Here's my deepest fear: That I'm loving you wrong. Too heavy. Like trying to hold water by making a fist. That my need for you has its own gravitational pull and one day you'll get tired of orbiting my anxieties.

But then you leave post-its in my lunch. Just drawings of octopi wearing hats. No explanation. And I think: maybe this is exactly the right amount of insane.

*

So here's what I'm asking: Stay. Not because this letter is beautiful (it isn't). Not because I deserve you (I don't). But because your socks are already mixed with mine in ways that would take archaeologists to untangle. Because you know which nightmares require tea versus coffee. Because when you're gone, I have entire conversations with the dent you leave in the sofa.

Because "I love you" is inadequate but "you've fundamentally altered my molecular structure" is too long for wedding vows.

*

Marry me, Leyi. Let me spend the next sixty years memorizing your disappointments. Learning your angers like a second language. Cataloguing every new way your face rearranges when surprised by joy.

Let me be the person who brings you water at 3 AM without being asked. Who knows your Wednesday mood versus your Thursday mood. Who guards your sleep like it's a state secret.

Let me love you badly and well and sideways and too much until one of us expires from natural causes and the other has to learn how to breathe with half a respiratory system.

*

Final inventory:
- Times I've written this letter: 1,034
- Times I've deleted it: 1,033  
- Number of ways to say "I would dismantle myself and rebuild from scratch if you asked": Still counting
- What you mean to me: [ERROR - EXCEEDS AVAILABLE LANGUAGE]

You're crying. Left eye first, like always. Here—I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since the day I learned your tear patterns. Some people study astronomy. I studied you.

That's all. That's everything.

Say yes. Or say no. Just please—
say it in that voice that makes me believe in God or randomness or whatever force was kind enough to drop you into my timeline.

(who has seventeen drafts of suicide notes that all end with "but then who would make sure Leyi doesn't burn eggs?")

P.S. — I lied about the suicide notes. There are twenty-three. You make me want to live forever just to spite the actuarial tables. That's how I know it's real. When someone makes you furious at mortality itself.

P.P.S. — Your middle name is my computer password. Your birthday is my ATM pin. Your existence is my security question. I'm a terrible risk to myself but god, what a way to go.
