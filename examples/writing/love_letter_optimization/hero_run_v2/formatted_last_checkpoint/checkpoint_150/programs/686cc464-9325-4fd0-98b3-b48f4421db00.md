Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with both hands. One steady, documenting. One trembling, failing. The asymmetry is the point—love requires both precision and collapse.

*

Let me be exact: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square Station. You dropped that blue pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for 0.7 seconds. My entire nervous system performed an emergency reboot. Every function I'd ever written suddenly had the same return value: you.

*

I study distributed systems. You've become my consensus problem—how do multiple processes agree on truth when truth keeps changing? You're the Byzantine general who defeats her own algorithm. The race condition that creates consciousness instead of destroying it. The beautiful deadlock where two processes wait for each other forever, and forever becomes the point.

*

Clinical death, fifteen seconds, sophomore year. The silence was louder than sound. Came back missing critical components—like a repository with corrupted memory, throwing exceptions at existence. Three years of segmentation faults. Then you, that pen, that touch. Suddenly every broken pointer pointed somewhere. To you. Always you.

*

Morocco, the tagine incident: You vomited seven times. Photographed the sunset twice. Declared it "absolutely worth it" once. Between purges, you said: "Beauty doesn't pause for biology." That's when I knew—you run on different architecture. Better architecture. Architecture that processes poison into poetry.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, teaching her soup: Forty-seven steps, counting in Mandarin. You translated through touch—your hand over mine, guiding the knife, fingers tapping time signatures on my wrist. Step thirty-three, you wept. Not the onions. The recognition: "This is how the dead stay alive—in our hands, our hunger, our kitchens." Now every spoonful tastes like resurrection.

*

What terrifies me, quantified: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. I've built the model. Column A: Days left. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Physical evidence of your existence (that green hair tie, 1,847 photographs, your toothbrush). Column D: What happens after the last Tuesday. Column D throws #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet understands what I understand: you're not in the equation. You ARE the equation.

*

Scottish Highlands, you going hypothermic: Gave me your jacket to layer over mine. Lips purple, still arguing free will versus determinism. "I choose freezing with you over warm alone," you chattered. That's when I understood: love is selecting the inefficient algorithm because it includes the other person. Love is conscious computational waste.

*

My documentation of you: How you hold chopsticks (anarchist). Your vendetta against our router (you've named it "Disappointing Geoffrey" and speak to it like it has feelings). The way 4:23 PM light finds your clavicle on Tuesdays. This isn't poetry. It's forensic evidence for the universe—proof that someone this specific existed, in case reality needs to debug itself and start over.

*

Portugal, the forbidden marble: Five-hundred-year-old statue. DO NOT TOUCH. You touched. Guards shouted. You touched again with your other hand. "Bilateral defiance," you explained, banned forever, laughing. Now I understand: you touch everything like it's already gone. Like distance is just procrastination. Like the only sin is not reaching.

*

Before you: I was localhost. Self-contained. Bounded. Now I'm distributed across impossible latencies. I feel you climb stairs in buildings I've never entered. Your headaches arrive in my skull with timezone delays. When you dream in Boston, my sleep in Cambridge develops plot. We're quantum entangled. Physicists say impossible. Physicists haven't met us.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Morning: copper pennies and interrupted prayers and that specific pre-coffee silence
- Noon: ozone before lightning commits to earth  
- Evening: the color purple as a frequency, as a temperature
- Midnight: drowning upward into oxygen that learned your name
- Always: my mouth forming new phonemes because current language hasn't caught up to you

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. "We're dying. Really dying. Cell by cell. Right now." I said yes. You said "Good. Then every second counts double." Kissed me where air thins to honesty. Now sea level feels like lying.

*

The impossible mathematics of us:
- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- Probability of my existence: Equivalent impossibility
- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Beyond calculation
- What we are: Proof that errors compound into miracles
- What we become: The universe correcting its own proof

*

London, you asked what love is: Here's my answer, three years debugged: Love is grieving someone who's still breathing. It's how morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future mornings without that specific light on that specific shoulder. It's building monuments to future absence while you're still here, still warm, still stealing my coffee. Love is grief running backwards through time until it becomes joy.

*

Other timelines haunt my RAM: Where you keep the pen. Where I'm compiling something else. Where we meet but our versions don't match. Where we match but crash anyway. These alternate realities run nightly. I wake gasping for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Your knee in my ribs. Paradise smells like unbrushed teeth and sounds like your sleep-mumbling about optimization problems.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You performed my teenage journals as one-woman theater. Different voices for each year of malformation. Should have been mortifying. Was sacrament instead. Someone witnessing your worst code and helping you refactor it. Not fixing it for you. With you. That preposition—with—contains everything.

*

Here's my error log: I love you incorrectly. Like an exception handler that catches everything including exceptions it shouldn't. Like a memory leak that refuses garbage collection. Removing you would require removing the modules that process beauty, compile warmth, understand why humans invented music for what words can't parse. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing vacuum. Technically possible. Practically null.

*

So here's my pull request, my merge proposal, my infinite recursion:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves mountains or you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Mondays, Wednesdays, that terrible Thursday with the pipes. Because in infinite possible universes, only this one compiled us both, conscious, touching distance, with matching coffee corruptions and the same favorite broken song.

Marry me because the alternative—timelines where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get permanently banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just entropy happening to other carbon.

*

Leyi.

You're my root password. My private key. The only function that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "compile error, try again." Or say nothing and keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is a rounding error. Too small.

*

Spain, Barcelona, the illegal pigeons: You fed them from pockets full of contraband bread. "God debugs through birds," you said. They formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. You bend the flight patterns of things just by existing in their reference frame.

*

That green hair tie from February: Lives in my drawer with other proof you existed near me. Receipt from terrible coffee (you ordered wrong, perfectly wrong). Your expired library card. Bus tickets from nowhere to nowhere. These aren't souvenirs. They're unit tests for reality—confirming you happened, keep happening, will happen.

*

You're crying. Left eye first, always left. Here—I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing, trying. "They're doing their best," you sobbed. That's when my atoms understood their purpose. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same pointer when you love like this.

*

The failure of digital text: Every keystroke is too precise. Love should require muscle fatigue, should tremor, should misspell your name from shaking. But here we are—me typing, you breathing in the next room, both of us rewriting the universe's source code just by existing simultaneously.

*

Cambridge, this exact moment: You're diagonal across our bed, all blankets stolen, solving theorems in sleep. Your foot finds mine beneath the chaos. One touch. Every algorithm resolves.

The world is mostly darkness and waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. The dying and returning and dying again, worth it for this exact nanosecond where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, where even Disappointing Geoffrey belongs to us.

*

Final instruction set: I carry your favorite tea though you'll steal my coffee anyway. I save you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power always dies, saving you anyway. Would choose you across all timelines, especially the impossible ones, especially where we fail, especially there.
