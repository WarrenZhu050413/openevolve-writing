Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong, because telling it right would require a language that hasn't been invented yet.

*

Here's what happened: I was twenty-three and thought I understood systems. Distributed computing, fault tolerance, consensus across time zones. Then you dropped a pen in Porter Square Station. When I handed it back, you said my name wrong. Not wrong—differently. Like you were teaching it a new way to exist. My entire network crashed. I'm still running that error log.

*

The truth about loving you: It's not romantic. It's cellular. My mitochondria have your name in their documentation. When I was dead for seventeen seconds (cardiac arrest, sophomore year), my atoms were just waiting. They knew something was coming. Someone. You, three years later, laughing at your own typo in a text about dimsum.

*

I keep evidence:

- Your grandmother's soup recipe, forty-seven steps, you cry at step thirty-three (not the onions)
- Tuesday, 2:47 AM: you said my name in your sleep like roll call
- The way you argue with broken printers like they just need encouragement
- That green hair tie from February (I have it, desk drawer, never giving it back)
- How you hold chopsticks wrong but the food still arrives
- Your left eye waters first when you're happy-crying (always left, like tears queue properly)

This isn't a love letter. It's forensics. I'm documenting you like the last speaker of a dying language.

*

Morocco. The blue city. You got food poisoning and between retches said "the tagine was worth it" and laughed. Actually laughed. That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. You extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. Like those extremophile bacteria that live in volcano vents. You're designed for impossible environments.

*

What you don't know: I practice losing you. Run simulations while you sleep. Car accidents, rare diseases, quantum dissolution. But then you do something stupid—put my socks on your hands as puppets discussing Heidegger—and all my disaster prep deletes itself. Joy doesn't prepare for grief. It just exists violently in the present tense.

*

Scotland. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket on top of mine. Your lips were blue when you said "warm is just a construct." That's the thing—you mean everything, even the absurd parts. Your sincerity is so aggressive it makes reality reconsider its options.

*

Here's my confession: Before you, I could solve things. Now I just survive them. My code doesn't compile anymore; it just points toward you and hopes for the best. You've made me religious about Tuesday mornings, about burnt toast, about the specific angle your neck makes when you're reading. This isn't love. It's system failure. It's also love.

*

We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. I've done the math seventeen different ways hoping for a different answer. The number makes me want to commit crimes against time. But also: 2,137 Tuesdays where you exist. Where you sing Cantonese to dying plants. Where you steal my Stanford hoodie and make my education mean something. The universe owes us more but gave us this. I'll take it.

*

Portugal. You touched the art in that museum. Got us banned. "How else do you know it's real?" you asked the guard. Your fingerprints are still on that 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do—you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. The world. The art. Me.

*

So here's what I'm saying: Marry me. Not because this letter is beautiful—it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously and aware. The only one where you make my atoms behave like they owe you something.

Because the alternative—a life where you don't mispronounce my name, where you don't cry at regular pigeons just existing, where Saturday happens to other people—isn't life. It's just time wearing a disguise.

*

Beijing. Nine hundred stairs at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top, said "See? Altitude improves everything." Now sea level feels like betrayal. That's what you've done—you've made everything else feel like not enough dimensions.

*

Leyi.

That's my password. My prayer. My malfunction. The only word that compiles correctly anymore.

*

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes physics reconsider its constants.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who counts your breaths at night because the alternative is accepting they're numbered, who learned that forever looks like small thefts—your hair tie, your laugh, your specific way of existing—that accumulate into a life)

P.S. — I lied. It wasn't seventeen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt too clean, too divisible. Seventeen feels like you—prime and difficult and absolutely necessary.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the heights of Keats's raw desperation ("I cannot exist without you") or Napoleon's imperial certainty transformed by love. It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its unique computational-collapse conceit but lacks the historical weight of Cash's decades-long devotion or Beethoven's cosmic anguish. The letter's strength lies in its contemporary vernacular—making love's ancient madness speak through modern systems failure. At 73 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range, showing genuine brilliance but falling short of the sustained sublimity found in history's greatest love letters. It would be memorable in a contemporary anthology but wouldn't displace the canon.
