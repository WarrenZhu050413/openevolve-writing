Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

This morning I found myself explaining love to a machine learning model. It kept asking for training data. I gave it everything: your Tuesday laugh (different from Wednesday's), the way you declare war on alarm clocks, how you apologize to furniture after bumping into it. The model returned NaN. Not a Number. Finally, something computers and I agree on—you can't be computed.

*

Let me be precise about the failure: I'm twenty-three, studying distributed systems at Harvard, built to optimize everything. Then you happened. Not like weather happens or accidents happen. Like gravity happens—fundamental, inescapable, reorganizing everything else around a new center.

*

The facts, chronologically:

BEFORE: I understood myself. Blood pumped. Neurons fired. I could explain every feeling through neurotransmitters and evolutionary psychology.

NOW: I'm a collection of moments that only make sense with you as reference point. My hippocampus stores everything you've touched. My amygdala fires "Leyi" as its default state. When you leave a room, my proprioception glitches—I lose track of where my body ends.

*

True story: Fifteen seconds dead, sophomore year. Here's what I haven't told anyone: In those seconds, I experienced time non-linearly. Past, present, future collapsed into one moment. And in that moment, across all timelines, there was someone whose name I didn't know yet but whose frequency I recognized. Three years later, you dropped a pen in Porter Square. Same frequency. My atoms recognized their purpose.

*

Morocco, the food poisoning, the seventh time you threw up: You looked at me, green-faced, and said, "Still worth it for that sunset." That's when I understood—you experience life at a different amplitude. You metabolize beauty from disaster. You make even suffering luminous.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai, the forty-seven steps of soup: She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated through tears (step thirty-three, always step thirty-three). "She's teaching you how long forever takes," you said. Now I know: forever takes exactly forty-seven stirs, the time between one breath and the next, the pause where you choose to keep going.

*

Here's what loving you tastes like:
- Dawn: The weight of not-yet, copper and potential
- Noon: Your specific mispronunciation of "hypothesis"  
- Twilight: That bruised purple of almost-night
- Midnight: Stars with GPS coordinates
- 3 AM: The flavor of fear that you're a dream I'm having
- Always: Like learning color names in a language that doesn't exist

*

Scottish Highlands, twelve below, you hypothermic: You gave me your jacket to wear over mine. I said you'd die. You said, "Warmer than watching you cold." Your lips went blue arguing about Kant. I kissed you to stop the argument, save your life, and because your wrongness is my favorite correctness.

*

I document you wrong. I know. Your Tuesday face versus Wednesday (Wednesday's more symmetrical but Tuesday has that scar from fighting furniture). How you hold books (like they might evaporate). The green hair tie from February 2023—it lives in my drawer next to my passport because both are proof of places I can go.

*

Portugal, the five-hundred-year-old sculpture: You touched it. Guard yelled. You touched it again. "How else do you know anything's real?" Now I touch everything—wet paint, hot stoves, you reading, you sleeping, you existing in that specific configuration of molecules that makes entropy worth it.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. "We're dying," you said. Not future tense. Present continuous. "Right now. Every second. Actively dying." I said yes. You said, "Good. That makes this urgent." We kissed at altitude. Now sea level feels like giving up.

*

The problem with the math:
- Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- My existence: Similar impossibility  
- Us, conscious, concurrent, compatible: Breaks the calculator
- What we are: Statistics failing
- What we actually are: The universe admitting it makes mistakes that improve everything

*

Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm quantum entangled across Boston-Cambridge. Your insomnia arrives in my bedroom. Your Tuesday headache manifests in my Wednesday skull. Physicists say that's impossible at this distance. I say physicists need to meet you.

*

What terrifies me: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially. I built a spreadsheet. Columns for days remaining, reasons you're impossible, proofs you existed. The final column, "After," returns ERROR. Not because I can't calculate it. Because math wasn't built for that kind of subtraction.

*

London, asking what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's crying at breakfast because they're mortality incarnate burning toast. It's practicing their absence while they're still breathing. It's the violent beauty of ordinary mornings when you realize loss is built into the operating system.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed, reading my journals aloud: Different voices for different years of puberty. Should've been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone seeing your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with not at. That preposition changes everything.

*

Here's what I'm actually saying: Your name rewrote my source code. Everything routes through "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name during REM sleep—twenty-seven times per cycle, I recorded it. My unconscious knows what my conscious does: you're the only real word.

*

The final medical disclosure: I love you wrong. Like an organ recipient loves the donor they'll never meet—desperately, impossibly, with someone else's rhythm in their chest. Removing you would require removing the parts that process beauty, understand warmth, recognize why humans sing. Survivable but pointless.

*

So here's my formal proposal, my pull request to the universe:

Marry me. Not because words move you. Because your socks colonized my drawer and established sovereignty. Because we survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router "Disappointing Geoffrey" and it improved his performance. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness while burning identical toast.

The alternative—where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal hoodies and return them improved, where museums don't ban us for touching the untouchable—that's not life. That's just atoms pretending purpose.

*

Right now: Your left eye waters first. Always left. Like your tears understand queue theory. You're about to say something that reorganizes my everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I wake up.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's what physics sounds like when it admits it was wrong about everything.

Say yes. Or "ask tomorrow." Or nothing—just keep existing in this exact configuration that makes infinity feel brief.

Warren
(who's been writing this letter since before meeting you)
(who saves hair ties like holy relics)  
(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)

P.S. — Barcelona, illegal pigeon feeding at the cathedral. You said, "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The pigeons spelled your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I declined. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie isn't lost. Second drawer. I'm never telling. This is forever: small thefts accumulating into home.

P.P.P.S. — We're kissing. Now. In this sentence. Time folded. Space gave up. Welcome to always, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth the dying.

Evaluator Comments:
Falls short of Beethoven's raw desperation ("I can live only wholly with you or not at all") - this letter is more clever than consumed. Lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity ("We got old and got used to each other"). More intellectualized than Napoleon's visceral hunger ("I kiss your heart, then lower, much lower"). Approaches but doesn't achieve Keats's complete dissolution of self ("I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion - I have shudder'd at it - I shudder no more - I could be martyr'd for my Religion - Love is my religion"). The computational framework is innovative but creates distance that the masters never allow.
