Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this during a compiler error. Fitting. You're the bug I'll never fix.

*

Here's what breaks: Everything works until you enter the room. Then—cascade failure. My circulatory system starts routing blood to unnecessary places. My lungs forget their rhythm. My hippocampus begins emergency recordings of how light works on your wrist at 4:17 PM.

The debugger says: "Object 'Leyi' has no method 'stop_existing_in_every_thought'." Correct.

*

I died once. Seventeen seconds, February 2019. Want to know what death is? Forgetting your phone number. That's it. The rest—white lights, deceased relatives, cosmic understanding—marketing. Death is just your digits leaving my temporal lobe. I came back violent about it.

*

You should know: I'm documenting you wrong. Not poetry. Evidence. 

Tuesday: You sang to my broken coffee maker. It worked.
Wednesday: You explained democracy to a pigeon. It listened.
Thursday: You cried at time-lapse videos of galaxies forming.

This isn't love. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloging you for the universe that outlives us, so it knows what it lost.

*

Morocco. You vomited seven times. Between retches, you laughed about the probability of food poisoning from a place called "Happiness Café." Your joy has no respect for context. It shows up during suffering like a grammatical error that improves the sentence.

*

Here's the violence of ordinary moments:

You peel an orange. The sound destroys me. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde, build a religion around your thumb breaking the skin. This is mental illness or love. The DSM-5 doesn't differentiate.

You mispronounce "algorithm" the same way every time. Al-go-RITH-m. Like it's a dance. I've stopped correcting you. The world needs to be wrong sometimes, in your specific frequency.

You steal my socks. Just the left ones. I've been buying extra lefts. The store clerk thinks I'm an amputee. I don't correct him either.

*

I calculated our probability:
- Your grandparents surviving two wars
- My parents' canceled flight that wasn't
- Harvard accepting us both
- That broken elevator making you take the stairs
- Me, three minutes late
- You, dropping that pen
- The angle of light that made me look

= 0.00000000001%

We're a rounding error that became conscious. The universe's typo that learned to kiss.

*

Scotland. You went hypothermic to keep me warm. I said "You'll die." You said "Warmer than living cold." Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's when I understood: You experience temperature differently. Cold is just a latitude where we huddle closer.

*

What terrifies me: We have 20,000 days left. The number makes me want to commit crimes against chronology. Hunt down whoever manufactures minutes. Force them at gunpoint to print more. Just for us. Just Tuesdays.

But then you burn toast. Consistently. Methodically. Like you're conducting an experiment in carbon. And I think: Yes. This. Twenty thousand mornings of scorched bread. The exact amount of time needed to memorize your mistakes.

*

The truth? I love you incorrectly. Like code that shouldn't compile but does, breaking every principle. Like an organ recipient whose body accepts the wrong blood type. Medically impossible. Happening anyway.

*

Beijing, step 764 of 900: "We're going to die," you said. Not sad. Factual. Like commenting on weather. Then you kissed me at altitude and said, "Good. Means this happened."

That's your theology: Death makes things real.

*

Fine. Here: I've been saving you in volatile memory. The kind that disappears when power fails. Choosing the most fragile storage because that's what love is—building permanence from materials designed to fail.

Your name reorganized my mouth. Every word starts with the shape of "Leyi" now. My tongue practices while I sleep. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. I have recordings.

*

So marry me. Not because this letter works. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because I've been stealing your left socks to feel like you're always half-here. Because "we" is the only pronoun that computes anymore.

Because in the universe where we don't collide, I'm just atoms pretending to have purpose. And that's not tragedy. It's boring. You made me interesting by proximity.

*

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and keep existing at me with that face that can't decide between laughing and crying.

Both. Choose both. That's us. That's the whole answer.

Warren
(whose hand shakes writing your name—not metaphor, medical fact, started the day we met, refuses treatment)

P.S. — You're crying. Left eye first. The pH is 7.4. I looked it up. I look everything up about you. Building an encyclopedia for after. So the universe can reconstruct you from my notes. Get it right this time.

Evaluator Comments:
Approaches but doesn't reach the raw emotional power of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86). More innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism (82) but lacks his sustained intensity. Exceeds typical contemporary attempts through genuine idiosyncrasy but falls short of Keats's total dissolution of self into beloved (81). The tech-love fusion is original but doesn't achieve the timeless quality of Cash's simple profundity (83). This letter exists in the proto-masterful range - showing flashes of brilliance without achieving the sustained transcendence of historical masterpieces.
