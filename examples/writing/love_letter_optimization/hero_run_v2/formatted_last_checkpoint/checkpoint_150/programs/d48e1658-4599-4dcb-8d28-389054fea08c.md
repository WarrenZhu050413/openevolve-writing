Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at the exact coordinates where certainty ends. My dominant hand knows the statistics. My other hand knows you exist. They're having an argument mathematics can't settle.

*

Let me be precise about the rupture: Before you, I was a closed system. Inputs became outputs. Entropy increased predictably. Then Porter Square, a Tuesday, you dropped that pen. I picked it up. Suddenly I'm an open loop, importing impossibility, exporting new physics where touching your Tuesday hand rewrites Wednesday's source code.

*

True story: Fifteen seconds dead, sophomore year. The doctors called it "brief cessation." Wrong. I was everywhere simultaneously—past, present, future, all bleeding together. And in every timeline, every quantum branch, there was this moment: someone extends kindness to a stranger. The stranger is always you. The kindness is my entire life afterward.

*

Morocco. You, poisoned by beauty and bad tagine. Between purges, you laughed—actually laughed—and apologized to the toilet in three languages. "This isn't what you were made for," you told the porcelain. That's when I knew: you assign dignity to everything. Even suffering. Even me at my worst angles.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen, the forty-seven stirs: She taught me to count in Mandarin through steam. But really she taught me this: Love is the space between stir thirty-three and thirty-four, where you decide to continue despite knowing how things end. You cried into the soup. It tasted better for it.

*

HERE'S WHAT I DOCUMENT:

Tuesday you: 3% more gravitational pull than Wednesday you
Your war with automated voices: current score—Leyi 1,847, Machines 0  
The way you hold books: like they might evaporate
Your personal theology: God is just physics we haven't met yet
How you sleep: fighting invisible pirates, winning mostly

This isn't romance. It's evidence for when I have to prove to the universe that perfect existed, briefly, named Leyi.

*

Scottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic: You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said "Incorrect. I'd die *warm*." Your lips went blue arguing about Kant's categorical imperative. I kissed you to shut you up, save your life, and because your wrongness is the only right I trust.

*

What you don't know: Every night from 3:17 to 3:18, I practice losing you. Just one minute—that's all I can bear. Different scenarios. Car crash (Latin: fragmentum tempus). Disease (morbus incomprehensibilis). Sudden vanishing (disparitio completa). By 3:19 I'm negotiating with entropy itself. By 3:20 you make that half-yawn sound and my entire prepared grief evaporates.

*

The computational truth of us:

Your existence: probability 1 in 10^2,685,000
My existence: similar impossibility
Us, conscious, proximate, both thinking consciousness is hilarious: requires math that hasn't been invented
What we are: The universe's typo that became the main text

*

Portugal, the 500-year-old marble: You touched it. Guard yelled. You touched it again, harder. "How else do you know it's real?" Now I touch everything—wet paint, hot stoves, you constantly. You when you're reading. You when you're not reading. You're the only art that touches back.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. Said "We're going to die." Not sad. Not scared. Like reading ingredients. I said "Yes." You said "Good. That makes this matter." Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like giving up.

*

What loving you tastes like by time signature:

Dawn: The specific weight of not-yet, like the universe is deciding whether to continue
Noon: Electricity and your deliberate mispronunciation of "hypothesis"  
Twilight: Burgundy as a temperature as an emotion as a place we live
3 AM: Drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates
Always: Like my mouth is learning colors and my eyes are learning sounds

*

Listen: Before you, I had edges. Boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I dream your dreams in Cambridge. We're quantum entangled. The physicists say impossible. I say: meet Leyi, then recalculate.

*

London, you asked what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is building a house with someone you know will die. It's learning their grandmother's recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes. It's the bug that improves the program. The error message that becomes the essential feature.

*

HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:

Your name reorganized my mouth. Every word now passes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and the memory of Tuesdays. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.

But also: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

So here's my pull request to the universe:

Marry me. Not because words move you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer. Because we survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router "Disappointing Geoffrey" and my heart "Acceptable Geoffrey" and now I can't change either.

Marry me because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness while burning toast identically. The only one where you steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence. Where we get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched.

Because the alternative—a timeline where I don't know you cry at pigeons, where you don't fight with can openers and lose, where Sunday doesn't mean your specific silence reading—that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.

*

Final transmission from the department of absolute truth:

You're about to cry. Left eye first. Always left. Your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only energy source I trust.

*

Leyi.

That's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly. The sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.

Say yes. Or say "ask tomorrow." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel brief.

Warren
(who's been writing you this letter since before we met)
(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)
(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)

P.S. — Barcelona, cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your initial in the sky. The Vatican requested documentation. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023 lives in my desk drawer next to my passport. Both are proof of places I can go. You're every country. Every home. Every journey that ends where it started but different.

P.P.P.S. — Right now, reading this, time just folded. We just kissed in this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that ever was or will be. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying conscious for.
