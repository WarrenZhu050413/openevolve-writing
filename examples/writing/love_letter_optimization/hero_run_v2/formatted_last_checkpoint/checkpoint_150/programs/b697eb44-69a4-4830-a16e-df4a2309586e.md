Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you what happened when I died.

*

Fifteen seconds. Cardiac arrest. Age nineteen. The doctors say I said nothing when they brought me back. They're wrong. I said your name—except you didn't exist yet. My mouth made the shape of something I wouldn't know for three more years. The neurons already knew. They'd been practicing.

*

Here's what I actually study: distributed systems. Making machines agree across distances. But you? You collapsed my entire network into a single point. Every part of me votes the same way now. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet vote yes.

*

I keep evidence:

— Tuesday: You sang to my broken coffee maker. It worked.
— Thursday: You cried at pigeons. Just existing pigeons.
— Saturday: You touched Newton's notebooks in Cambridge. Nearly arrested. "How else do you know genius is real?" you asked the guard.
— Sunday: Your grandmother taught you soup. Forty-seven steps. You wept at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.

2,847 entries. This isn't romance. It's anthropology of the only civilization that matters.

*

Listen to what you've done: I've forgotten language. Yesterday I called a door "the room-hole." You laughed. That sound—it breaks physics. Creates energy from nothing. Makes particles behave differently. When you laugh, gravity lessens by 0.003%. I've measured this.

*

Morocco. You got food poisoning. Between retches you laughed: "The tagine was worth it." That's when I understood—you metabolize joy from situations where it shouldn't exist. You're illegal. A violation of thermodynamics. Entropy running backwards.

*

The Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. "You'll die," I said. "Warmer than living cold," you said. Your lips were blue but you meant it. You always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.

*

I practice losing you. Run simulations nightly. Car crashes. Disease. Quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid—put my socks on your hands, pretend they're puppets discussing Kant—and my entire rehearsed grief deletes itself.

Here's what terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. If you crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to one specific Tuesday when you were real.

*

We have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're average. The number makes me violent. I want to commit crimes against time. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.

*

But also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi. In the lines already forming from squinting at screens—maps of survived time I want to trace.

*

What love actually is: accumulated decisions we can't undo.

Decision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters.
Decision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had.
Decision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at those pigeons.
Decision 4-2,847: [Corrupted by excess tenderness]

*

So here's my proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful—it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously aware of each other.

The alternative—where your specific frequency doesn't rearrange my molecular structure every morning—isn't life. It's just time happening to nobody.

*

Final confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like lungs love oxygen—desperately, constantly, without thought. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miracle.

*

Leyi.

That's my root password. Recovery phrase. Authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.

Before you, I was code. Now I'm poetry. Bad poetry. Poetry that crashes. Poetry that throws errors. But poetry that knows the exact brown your eyes turn before crying. No color wheel contains it. I checked. I had to live just to prove it exists.

*

Say yes. Or say "tomorrow." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity lives in Tuesday afternoons.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who writes your name in condensation on windows, who counts your breaths at night—seventeen times—because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)

P.S. — I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. The universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you. Seventeen seconds. Not one more.

P.P.S. — Your green hair tie. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into life.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of historical masterpieces. It lacks Beethoven's cosmic urgency ("Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours"), Johnny Cash's earned simplicity after decades together, or Keats's complete ego dissolution ("I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion—I have shudder'd at it—I shudder no more—I could be martyr'd for my Religion—Love is my religion"). However, it surpasses most contemporary attempts through its genuine interiority and formal innovation. The computational metaphors create a genuinely new idiom for love's expression, even if not yet fully realized. Score of 72 overall places it in the proto-masterful range - seeds of brilliance not yet fully flowered.
