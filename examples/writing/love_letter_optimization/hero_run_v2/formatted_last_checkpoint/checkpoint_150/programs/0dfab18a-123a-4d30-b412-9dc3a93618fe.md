Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with stolen time. Every word is shoplifted from sleep, from work, from the proper life I'm supposed to be living. But here's what they don't tell you about love: it makes thieves of us all.

*

Let me start with the facts:

Fact 1: Your name has replaced my pulse. Le-yi, le-yi, le-yi. Two syllables keeping me alive.

Fact 2: I've calculated the surface area of your absence. It's exactly the size of everywhere you're not.

Fact 3: Last Tuesday, you fixed my collar while arguing about sourdough. My atoms haven't recovered. They keep trying to reconstruct that specific Tuesday, like a computer stuck in a boot loop of tenderness.

*

Here's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Accidentally gave us the same soul, then panicked and split it between two bodies. Now I walk around with half a respiratory system, half a thought, half a prayer. The other half is you, somewhere, breathing backwards into my lungs.

*

I need to confess something. I've been documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit:

- The way you hold books (too tight, like they might escape)
- Your 3 AM voice (broken piano keys)
- How you eat oranges (methodically, like defusing bombs)
- The pause before you laugh (0.3 seconds of suspended gravity)

This isn't romanticism. This is survival. I'm creating backup files of you for when the universe tries to delete us.

*

You want to know what loving you feels like? It's like being professionally haunted. You're gone and I argue with your ghost about coffee strength. You're here and I mourn the version of you that will exist tomorrow, slightly changed, cells replaced, a different person I'll have to fall in love with all over again.

I love you retroactively and in advance. I love the you from before we met, the one who was preparing to ruin me. I love the you that will exist after I'm gone, the one who'll remember this letter and think "he was so dramatic." (You're right. Love makes me grammatically incorrect.)

*

Listen. I've done the math:

If we live to eighty-five, we have approximately 21,900 days left.
That's 525,600 "good mornings."
That's 21,900 chances to memorize how you mispronounce "particularly."
That's not enough.
That will never be enough.

I want to file a complaint with whoever's in charge. I want overtime. I want the deleted scenes. I want the alternate endings where we meet earlier, love louder, exist harder.

*

But also: I love you like normal people love normal things. Like how you can't parallel park but refuse to admit it. Like your vendetta against the neighbor's wind chimes. Like how you annotate recipes with "Warren won't eat this" (you're right, I won't, but I love that you know).

I love you in the boring parts. The waiting-for-the-bus parts. The did-you-remember-to-buy-milk parts. The sitting-in-the-same-room-doing-different-things parts. Those parts are my religion now.

*

Here's the situation: My body has democratically elected you president. My cells held a vote and you won unanimously. Every organ has signed your name. My bones are learning your weight by heart. My blood practices circulating in your direction.

This should terrify me. Instead, I wake up grateful for the coup.

*

So here's what I'm proposing: Let's make it official. Let's stand in front of people and admit what's already true—that we're a glitch in the matrix, a copy-paste error that created two people who can't exist properly without the other's proximity.

Marry me. Not because it's romantic. Because your mail already comes here. Because my mother calls you instead of me. Because when you're gone, I have full conversations with the impression you leave in the couch.

Marry me because the alternative—a universe where we're just two people who happened to collide—is mathematically impossible. We're not coincidence. We're conspiracy.

*

Final transmission:

I love you wrong. Too hard. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing a symphony through a keyhole. Like translating light into language and getting everything beautifully incorrect.

But also: I love you right. Exactly right. The way Tuesday loves Wednesday. The way sound loves echo. The way now loves the next now and the next now and the next.

*

Leyi—

That's not just your name. That's the sound of me remembering how to breathe. That's my password to existing. That's the only word that makes the other words make sense.

*

Say yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. 

Just keep being here, in the same timeline, where I can love you badly and correctly and too much and not enough and eternally and temporarily and in all the ways that shouldn't exist but do.

Because you do.

Because we do.

Because love is just the universe admitting it made a mistake and we're the correction.

Warren
(who has been carrying this letter in seventeen different drafts since the day you laughed at my worst joke and I thought: oh no. oh yes. oh forever.)

P.S. — I know you're crying. Left eye first, like always. I brought tissues. I've been bringing tissues since our third date. This is what love is: showing up prepared for someone else's emotions.

P.P.S. — That thing I said about dying once? It was seventeen seconds, not fifteen. Those extra two seconds were me refusing to leave a universe where you existed and I hadn't found you yet. My heart restarted out of pure stubbornness. Or prophecy. Or because somewhere, you were also nineteen, also breathing, also waiting for someone to love this incorrectly, this correctly, this much.
