Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is a democracy and my neurons voted against it. They want to tell you something. Not poetry. Just the mathematics of what you've done to me.

*

First equation: I died once. Fifteen seconds flat. Cardiac arrest, sophomore year, during a lecture on probability theory. The universe's idea of irony. You know what I learned? Death isn't peaceful. It's just subtraction. Everything minus everything equals nothing. But here's the thing about coming back—you owe something. To what? To whom? I didn't know until three years later when you mispronounced "Bayes' theorem" and my debt suddenly had a name.

*

You want honesty? I've become a criminal. I steal:

— The way light bends around your collarbone at 6:47 PM
— Your arguments with inanimate objects (the printer deserved it)
— That specific frequency your voice hits when lying about being fine
— The fossil record of your fingerprints on my coffee mug

I have 2,341 pieces of evidence. This isn't love. It's grand larceny. I'm building a museum of you for after the world ends.

*

Here's what terrifies me: I understand distributed systems. I've optimized networks that span continents. But you? You're a single point of failure in my entire architecture. One node goes down and everything cascades. No redundancy. No failover. Just catastrophic data loss.

Last night I calculated our probability of existing simultaneously: 1 in 10^2,685,000. The number is bigger than atoms in the observable universe. We shouldn't exist. Yet here you are, using my Stanford hoodie as pajamas, making my education finally worthwhile.

*

Truth: Before you, I could prove things. Now I just believe them. Like how you hum Cantonese songs to dying plants. How you annotate recipes like academic papers. How your grandmother's soup takes forty-seven steps and you cry at step thirty-three every time. (You claim onions. I've seen you cry at onions. This is different. This is grief for time you'll never get back and gratitude for what remains.)

*

Let me tell you about Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM. You fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were debugging why I'm still here. Wednesday you sang to broken coffee makers. Thursday you cried at dogs (left eye first—always left first, like tears queue in order). I document these things because historians need primary sources and I'm writing the definitive account of how you reorganized matter.

*

I've run simulations. In 12% of universes, we never meet. In 34%, we meet but mistime it. In 53%, one of us dies before recognition. This is the only timeline where both our particles organized correctly, where your specific way of existing overlapped with my particular form of being broken. The only one where you steal my socks and I pretend not to notice. Where your leftover dim sum disappears at 2 AM and we both know who's guilty.

*

You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot "door." Called it "the privacy rectangle." You laughed—a sound that violates conservation laws, creating energy from nothing. I wanted to record it but devices can't capture how air molecules rearrange themselves around your joy.

*

Here's my worst confession: I rehearse your absence. Practice grief like fire drills. Calculate the half-life of your shampoo smell in my pillows (seventeen days). Plan the museum layout—your annotations in cookbook margins, voicemails where you're angry about parking, that hair tie you've been looking for (I have it. I'm not sorry). Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. This isn't healthy. It's also the only sane response to loving something that operates on battery power and limited warranty.

*

But listen: I also love you in the debugger. In how you hold chopsticks wrong but food still arrives at your mouth. In your righteous fury at slow internet (beautiful fury—Old Testament fury). In how you'll look at seventy-three, which I can see sometimes when light hits you sideways. Those lines forming from decades of squinting at screens, mapping out survived time like contour lines on my favorite mountain.

*

So here's my pull request: Merge your life with mine. Not because this letter's beautiful. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because "git blame" shows you've been modifying my source code since before we met. Because in infinite parallel processing, this is the only thread where our functions execute synchronously.

Marry me because the alternative—where I don't hear you argue with Siri, where you don't steal my socks, where Saturday mornings happen to other people—isn't living. It's just CPU cycles without purpose.

*

Final disclosure: I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts of my brain that understand beauty, recognize patterns, process joy. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said "brains don't work that way." I said "then you don't understand the scope of the problem."

*

The universe is mostly nothing. 99.9999999% empty space. But sometimes atoms collide and make something impossible. Stars. DNA. Tuesday afternoons where you exist and know my name.

Leyi.

That's the collision that created everything else.

*

Say yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. 

I'll translate the silence. I've been studying your silences for 1,847 days.

This one means you're crying.

Left eye first.

Warren
(who's been carrying tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins and I realized my atoms had been waiting four billion years to hand you Kleenex)

P.S. — I lied about the fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. Two extra seconds of nothing that taught me what something means. I came back for the specific brown your eyes turn before crying. That brown doesn't exist in any catalog. I checked. I had to live just to prove it real.

P.P.S. — The hair tie is in my desk drawer. Second one from top. I'm still not sorry.
