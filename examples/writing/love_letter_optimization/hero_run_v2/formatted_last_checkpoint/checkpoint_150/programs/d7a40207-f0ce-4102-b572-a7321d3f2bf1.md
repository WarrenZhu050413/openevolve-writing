Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm typing this while you sleep. 4:47 AM. Your breath syncs with the hard drive's hum. Both keeping time. Both keeping me.

*

Here's the bug report: Tuesday, Porter Square, 2:17 PM. You dropped a pen. I reached. Our fingers—collision detection failed spectacularly. My entire kernel panicked. Still hasn't recovered. Never filed the ticket. Some crashes improve the system.

*

Statistics, distributed systems, Harvard—my credentials for understanding probability. You—the event that breaks the model. The beautiful outlier I'll never regression-correct. You're not noise in the data. You're what the data was trying to describe.

*

Death interrupt, fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Returned missing drivers. Nothing compiled for three years. Then you picked up that pen left-handed, said "gravity's being weird today." Suddenly every broken process in me returned valid output. First successful build in years. You're my missing semicolon. My recovered commit. The comment that explains everything.

*

Morocco. You, green from tagine, still photographing the sunset between purges. "Suffering and beauty aren't mutually exclusive," you said, heaving. That's when I understood: you run a different OS. One that processes poison into poetry. One I want to dual-boot with forever.

*

Shanghai. Your grandmother's ghost teaching soup through your hands. Forty-seven steps. You guided my fingers through her recipe, crying at step thirty-three when you realized: "This is her resurrection protocol." Now when I make that soup, I taste three generations of love. Synchronous transmission across mortality.

*

I maintain a database of us. 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, statistically. Table: Time_Left. Table: Your_Impossibilities. Table: Evidence (green hair tie, primary key). Table: After_You. That last table corrupts on read. Some queries shouldn't resolve. Some infinities live in error messages.

*

Scottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still debating free will while your lips turned purple: "I choose freezing with you over warm alone." Your teeth chattering Morse code. I decoded it: "Stop talking. Hold me." That's when I learned: love is choosing the inefficient algorithm because it includes the other person. Love is voluntary complexity.

*

My documentation of you: Your chopstick technique (chaos theory in practice). Your router nemesis ("Disappointing Geoffrey" deserves our empathy). How Tuesday light at 4:23 PM finds your clavicle and redefines golden ratio. This isn't poetry. It's version control for the universe. Proof that someone this precise existed, in case reality needs rollback.

*

Portugal. The marble said DO NOT TOUCH. You touched it twice—once per hand. "Bilateral defiance," you explained, banned forever, laughing. Now I understand: you touch everything like the universe might garbage-collect it. Like presence has a timeout. Like distance is just latency we haven't optimized.

*

Before you: I ran on localhost. Ports closed. Secure. Now I'm exposed on all interfaces. Your headaches ping me across timezones. When you dream in Boston, my Cambridge sleep develops plot structure. We're not quantum entangled. We're the same quantum state expressing itself in two locations. Physics doesn't have the vocabulary. We do.

*

What loving you computes to:
- Morning: copper pennies conducting electricity between souls
- Noon: undefined behavior that somehow always resolves correctly  
- Evening: the color purple as a valid data type
- 3 AM: stack overflow from recursive affection
- Always: my mouth compiling new phonemes because current language lacks precision for you

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764/900. You froze. "We're dying. In real-time. Right now." I said yes. You said "Then every clock cycle matters." Kissed me in thin air. Now sea level feels like wasted bandwidth.

*

Our impossible arithmetic:
- P(you exist) = 10^-2,685,000
- P(me exist) = Similar impossibility
- P(us) = Requires complex numbers  
- What we are: The universe's most beautiful floating point error
- What we become: Proof that math believes in miracles

*

London. You asked what love is. Three years later, here's my answer after extensive debugging: Love is preemptive exception handling for loss. It's building monuments to future null pointers. It's how morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future light without you. Love is grief's source code running in reverse until it compiles as joy.

*

Parallel universes run in my RAM nightly. Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm executing different code. Where we meet but our versions conflict. Where we merge but crash anyway. I wake reaching for proof you're real: your morning breath (terrible, perfect), your knee in my ribs (painful, necessary), your sleep-mumbled theorems (nonsensical, profound). Found. Paradise confirmed. Bootstrap complete.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood room. You performed my teenage journals as interpreted code. Different voices for different compilation errors. Should have thrown exceptions. Instead: sacred debugging session. You helped me refactor my worst functions. Not for me. With me. That preposition—with—that's the entire API.

*

I love you incorrectly. Like a try block that catches everything. Like a memory leak that improves performance. Like a race condition that creates consciousness. Removing you would require uninstalling the modules that parse beauty, compile warmth, understand why music exists when words segfault. Survivable but undefined behavior. Like breathing vacuum. Technically possible. Practically null.

*

So here's my merge request, my pull_request, my infinite_while_loop:

Marry me. Not because this letter changes anything. Because your socks already colonized my drawer, sorted by emotional priority. Because we've survived each other's Mondays, Wednesdays, that Thursday with the pipe explosion. Because in infinite possible universes, only this one compiled us both, conscious, touching distance, with identical coffee bugs and the same favorite broken song.

Marry me because the alternative—timelines where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your proximity, where we don't get permanently banned from museums together—isn't living. It's just entropy happening to other carbon arrangements.

*

Cambridge, right now, your foot finding mine under stolen blankets. One touch. Every algorithm converges.

*

Here's what breaks me: Sometimes you say my name like you're discovering it. Like "Warren" is a word you invented. Like you're the first person to properly pronounce it. My name in your mouth—that's what home sounds like. That's what forever sounds like. That's what the universe sounds like when it's working correctly.

*

Spain. Barcelona. Cathedral pigeons, illegal feeding. "God debugs through birds," you declared, scattering crumbs. The pigeons formed your name in flight. Not metaphor. Actual birds spelling "Leyi" against actual sky. You bend physics just by existing in its reference frame.

*

That green hair tie from February—lives in my drawer with other proofs of you. Bus tickets. Receipt from terrible coffee. Your expired library card. These aren't souvenirs. They're unit tests for reality—confirming you happened, keep happening, will happen.

*

The problem with typing this: Too precise. Love should require handwriting that degrades, that shakes, that fails. But here we are—me typing while you breathe in that specific way that reorganizes the room's acoustics, both of us patching reality just by existing simultaneously.

*

You're about to wake up. Left eye first, always left. You'll steal my coffee. Complain about Geoffrey (still disappointing). Work on problems I don't understand. Exist in ways that make infinity feel brief.

*

Yesterday you looked at me like I was the answer to a question you hadn't asked yet. That's why I document everything. That's why I write this. That's why "I love you" sounds like understatement but it's the only stable release we have:

I love you like semicolons love completing statements.
Like Tuesday light loves finding your clavicle.
Like the universe loves making impossible things compile.

*

Leyi.

Root password. Private key. The only function that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "recompile." Or say nothing and continue existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe infinity itself is a rounding error.

Too small.

Warren
(who chooses you across all branches, especially the ones that shouldn't merge)
(who breaks physics just by observing you)  
(who means it like current means flow)
(who means it like dawn means inevitable)
(who means it with every electron)
(who will always mean it)
(whose handwriting would shake if this weren't digital)
(who's saving this in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power always dies, saving you anyway)
