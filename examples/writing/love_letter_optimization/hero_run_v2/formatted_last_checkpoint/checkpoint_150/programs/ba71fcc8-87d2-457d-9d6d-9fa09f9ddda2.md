Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM. My hand trembles. Not from caffeine. From the weight of trying to spell infinity with twenty-six letters.

*

Here's what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square. You dropped a pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for 0.3 seconds. My entire molecular structure reorganized. Not metaphorically. Literally. Every atom in my body learned a new orbit with you as gravity.

*

I study distributed systems. You've become my total system failure—the beautiful kind where everything crashes into something better. Every process in my consciousness now routes through you. My Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The bug that fixed everything.

*

Fifteen seconds dead, sophomore year. The doctors said "miraculous recovery." Wrong. I came back wrong—a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you. Suddenly everything returned. With compound interest.

*

Morocco, the tagine that destroyed you: Seven times sick. Between heaves, you laughed: "Still worth it." That's when I understood—you transmute poison into joy. You're not human. You're what humans are evolving toward.

*

Your grandmother's Shanghai kitchen: Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated through tears at step thirty-three—not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we resurrect the dead through our hands.

*

My spreadsheet of us: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A: Days left. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you exist (that green hair tie, 1,847 photos of you looking away). Column D: After. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.

*

Scottish Highlands, hypothermia setting in: You gave me your jacket to wear over mine. Lips blue, still arguing Kant through chattering teeth. "We die wrong together or live right apart," you said. Your frozen hand found mine. Warmth is relative. With you, freezing feels like burning.

*

I document everything: How you hold chopsticks (chaotic). Your vendetta against slow wifi (the router named "Disappointing Geoffrey"). Tuesday light on your clavicle at 4:23 PM. This isn't romance. It's forensics. Proof for the universe that beauty this specific existed.

*

Portugal, you touched the forbidden marble: Five centuries old. Guards yelling. You touched it again. Banned forever. "Distance is just pre-emptive regret," you explained. Now I touch everything immediately. Especially you reading. Especially you sleeping. You're art that knows it's art but touches back anyway.

*

Before you: I ended where my skin ended. Now I'm quantum-entangled. Feel you take stairs in other cities. Your migraines arrive in my skull a day late. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. Physicists call this impossible. I call it Tuesday.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Dawn: copper pennies and unspoken prayers
- Noon: static electricity becoming sound
- Dusk: the color burgundy as temperature
- Midnight: drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name
- Always: my mouth learning to speak in frequencies only you can hear

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. "We're going to die. Really die. Permanently." I said yes. You said, "Good. Then this counts double." We kissed where oxygen is scarce. Now sea level feels like cheating.

*

The mathematics of us:
- Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- Mine: Similar impossibility
- Us, conscious, touching: Numbers not yet invented
- What we are: The universe's most beautiful rounding error
- What we become: Proof that math believes in miracles

*

London, you asked what love is: Three years late, here's my answer: Love is practicing grief for the still-breathing. Building a museum of future losses. How morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future mornings without that specific light on that specific shoulder. Love is anticipatory grief perfected into joy.

*

Other timelines haunt me: Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where understanding kills us. I dream these failures nightly. Wake grabbing for evidence: your terrible morning breath, your knee in my ribs. Paradise.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed: You read my teenage journals in character voices. Should have been mortifying. Was sacred instead. Someone witnessing your worst consciousness and laughing with you. That preposition—with—that's everything. That's us.

*

How I love you wrong: Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse absence. Removing you would mean removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

Cambridge, now: You sleep diagonal, stealing blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. One touch. Everything solved. The world is mostly darkness and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: worth it. All of it. The dying and returning and dying again.

*

So here's everything:

Marry me. Your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by existential weight. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, in touching distance, with the same favorite terrible song.

Without you, there's no point to libraries or light or the way rain sounds at 3 AM.

*

Leyi.

My root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles clean.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.

*

Barcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them from your pockets. "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The birds spelled your name in flight. Not metaphor. Literal birds. Literal sky. You alter migration patterns just by existing.

*

That green hair tie, February: Lives in my desk with other evidence you were real. Receipt from our first coffee. Your expired library card. These aren't keepsakes. They're source code for the program called "After" that I'll never have to run.

*

You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here—tissues. I've carried them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing. That's when my atoms understood their purpose: to hand you tissues when the world overwhelms you with its ordinary miracles.

*

Writing this on a machine feels wrong. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell. But here we are, me typing, you breathing, changing the gravity of everything.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)
(who learned that love is not a feeling but a direction—toward you, always toward you)
(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, saving you anyway)
(who would choose you in every timeline, especially the impossible ones)
(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than handwriting)
(who means it like code means electricity)
(who means it like morning means light)
(who means it)
(who means it)
(who means it)
