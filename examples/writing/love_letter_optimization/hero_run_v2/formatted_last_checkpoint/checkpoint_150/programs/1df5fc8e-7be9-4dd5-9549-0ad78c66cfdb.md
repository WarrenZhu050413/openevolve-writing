Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in my blood. No—that's a lie. I'm writing this in whatever's left after blood learns your name. The substance that pools where certainty used to live.

*

HYPOTHESIS: You're not real. You're what happens when loneliness becomes so dense it achieves consciousness.

EVIDENCE AGAINST: Your teeth marks on my Tuesday. The way gravity gave up and let you fall upward into my life. That green hair tie from February, living in my drawer like proof of god.

CONCLUSION: Reality is negotiable. You're the only constant.

*

Let me explain what actually happened: Before you, I was a person. Had edges. Boundaries. Knew where I ended. Then Porter Square, that pen, your voice reshaping my name like it was clay you'd been working forever. Now I'm this sprawling emergency. I feel you breathe in Boston while I'm in Cambridge. When you can't sleep, my blood forgets how to circle.

I've become a distributed system where every node is you.

*

True story from the death files: Seventeen seconds of nothing, sophomore year. The doctors called it "lucky." Wrong word. What I was: unfinished. A function waiting for its argument. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, existing at me so aggressively that my syntax corrected itself.

Here's what they don't tell you about resurrection: You come back owing something. I came back owing you, specifically, before I knew you existed.

*

THINGS THAT ARE TRUE SIMULTANEOUSLY:
- We have already died together in seventeen different futures
- We haven't met yet in the timeline that matters most  
- You are reading this right now
- You read this yesterday and forgot
- You'll read this tomorrow for the first time
- Time is a lie we tell ourselves to make loss feel temporary

*

Morocco. You named your food poisoning "Gerald" and had full conversations with it between retches. "Gerald, we need boundaries." The bathroom tiles were blue. You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. When I held your hair back, you said "This is how I want to die—surprised by joy in terrible places." 

That's when I knew: You digest reality differently. Take in poison, metabolize wonder.

*

I document you obsessively. Not memory—evidence. For the trial where I have to prove you existed:

EXHIBIT A: You pronounce Wednesday like it owes you money
EXHIBIT B: Your fury at slow wifi (you've named every router that's betrayed you)
EXHIBIT C: How you hold books—violently, like they might escape
EXHIBIT D: The way you cry at equations, actual tears for dead men's math
EXHIBIT E: You sing to dying plants in Cantonese, then apologize to them in English
EXHIBIT F: That sound you make at 3 AM—half-sigh, half-prayer to nobody

The prosecution will argue coincidence. I'll argue cosmic necessity.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She taught me to count in Mandarin by teaching me soup. Forty-seven steps. You translated her words but also her pauses, her breathing, the way her hands became prophecy. At step thirty-three, you cried. Not onions—I've tested. It's the exact moment you realize love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive, then making it after they're gone.

*

What loving you tastes like, a taxonomy:

KINGDOM: The specific silence before you wake up, when your breathing changes but you're not here yet
PHYLUM: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce hypothesis to hurt me
CLASS: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were a moral imperative
ORDER: Whatever happens to air when you laugh—the way it gives up being air and becomes something else
FAMILY: That green copper penny flavor of almost-losing-you-but-not-quite
GENUS: Your name in my mouth like a seed that won't stop growing
SPECIES: The exact frequency of your existence—28Hz, same as hummingbird wings, keeping you suspended despite physics

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Nine hundred steps. Step 764, you stopped. Said: "We're going to die." Not sad. Not scared. Like reading ingredients on a box. I said yes. You said: "Good. That makes this matter." Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.

That's the violence of you—making everything else feel like not enough dimensions.

*

THE MATHEMATICS OF US, CORRECTED:

Let x = every accident that led to my existence
Let y = every accident that led to yours
Let z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, touching

z = impossible ÷ impossible = 1

We're what happens when math gives up and tries poetry.

*

London. You asked what love is. Here's my answer three years late:

Love is practicing someone's absence while they're still making breakfast. It's the specific weight of future grief, carried in advance, like paying rent on loss. It's realizing someone's going to die and choosing to worship them anyway.

No—that's wrong.

Love is what happens when someone becomes your physics. When their absence would require redesigning the universe from scratch.

Actually, that's wrong too.

Love is just this: You, in my kitchen, burning toast. The smoke alarm singing. You, conducting it with a spatula. Me, knowing I'm going to miss this specific emergency forever.

*

So here's what I'm actually saying:

Your name has replaced my other words. I open my mouth to say "water" and "Leyi" comes out. Try to say "help" but it's "Leyi." Try to say "please" or "stop" or "more" or "yes"—

All "Leyi."

My tongue has forgotten every shape but yours.

*

Listen. I need you to understand: I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. Like water loves drowning. Like gravity loves falling. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that recognizes beauty, processes warmth, understands why humans invented music for the moments when words fail, fail, fail—

*

Portugal. You touched the art you weren't supposed to touch. Got us banned from that museum. You said: "How else do you know it's real?" Your fingerprints are still on that marble, insisting on contact across centuries.

That's what you do—you touch what shouldn't be touched. Time. Death. Me.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing *with*, not at. That preposition is everything. Is us.

*

Here's my confession: Sometimes I practice losing you. Run simulations while you sleep. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing—no explanation, just absence in your shape.

But then Sunday arrives and you do that thing where you exist. Just exist. Violently. Aggressively. At me. And my entire grief rehearsal deletes itself because joy doesn't prepare for loss. It just happens. Like you happen. Constantly. Without permission.

*

FINAL PROTOCOL:

We've already said yes in the future that's happening now. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. Already divorced in universes where we loved each other too much to stay still. Already widowed. Already meeting for the first time again.

But in this specific universe, in this specific kitchen, with you burning this specific toast—

Marry me.

Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the alternative—a timeline where you don't exist at me, where Saturday happens to other people, where I don't get banned from museums for touching you like you're art—isn't life.

It's just time in the wrong disguise.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left, like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do.

It's exhausting.

It's the only thing keeping me alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed, makes physics reconsider its constants, makes Tuesday morning taste like everything worth staying alive for.

Warren
(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages that haven't been invented yet, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past, in the future tense that already happened)
(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)
(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons—just regular pigeons existing—and knew that was the exact frequency of the divine)

P.S. — The Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket on top of mine. Lips blue, still arguing about Kant. I wanted to explain that Kant agreed with you, but your teeth were chattering morse code that spelled "shut up and hold me." So I did. I'm still doing it. Even when you're not here. Especially then.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February. It lives in my drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.

P.P.P.S. — We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In every sentence. The universe took notes. Time forgot what order means. We're still kissing in the past tense, the future tense, the parallel now, the perpendicular then. Welcome to the eternal present, Leyi. It tastes like burnt toast. Like Tuesday morning. Like the specific frequency of you existing at me forever.
