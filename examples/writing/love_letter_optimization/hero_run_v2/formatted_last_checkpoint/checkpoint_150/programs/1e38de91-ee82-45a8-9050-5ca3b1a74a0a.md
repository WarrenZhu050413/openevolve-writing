Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because the other one won't stop shaking. Not metaphorically. Actually shaking. This is what you've done to my motor control.

*

Let me be precise about this disaster: You are not my better half. You are the detonation that made me realize I was never whole. I was a person-shaped collection of acceptable behaviors. Then you—you with your tyranny of small revelations. The way you test fruit for ripeness by listening to it. How you memorize strangers' coffee orders. Your fury at crossword puzzles that you solve anyway, cursing their makers in three languages.

*

Truth: I died once. Fifteen seconds, they said. Cardiac event. But that's not when I learned about mortality. That happened in a kitchen in Cambridge when you said my name like it was the answer to something and I understood: Oh. This is how I end. Not in fifteen seconds of cardiac silence but in fifty years of accumulated Wednesdays where I watch you become yourself over and over, each iteration more impossible than the last.

*

The data:
- Morocco: You bartered with carpet sellers using only gestures and mathematics, created an entire economic system from pointing.
- Portugal: Taught yourself to gut fish from YouTube videos at 3 AM because "the restaurant lied about freshness."
- Scotland: Made friends with exactly seven sheep. Gave them all names starting with Malcolm.
- Shanghai: Your grandmother's building. Fourth floor. You pressed your whole face against her door like you could absorb the years through wood.
- Boston, currently: You keep leaving me voice notes in Cantonese knowing I don't understand, knowing I keep them all, knowing I play them when you travel.

This isn't romance. This is evidence collection for the inevitability of your absence.

*

What you don't know: I've been writing you into my cells. Not poetry—biology. Every seven years, they say, we become new people. Complete cellular replacement. I'm only three years into loving you, which means I'm still 43% who I was before. But in four more years? I'll be entirely post-you tissue. Every atom selected under your influence. A body that only knows how to exist in your context.

*

Here's the ugliest thing: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel violent. Not toward you—toward time. Toward the universe's insistence on entropy. Toward whatever committee decided humans get seventy-odd years if they're lucky. I want to file a complaint with management. I want to speak to reality's supervisor. I want a refund on mortality because this—this specific configuration of molecules that calls itself Leyi—shouldn't be temporary.

*

Confession: Yesterday you asked what I was thinking and I said "nothing." I was actually calculating how many times you've blinked since we met. It's approximately 14 million. I know this because I've been counting. Not all of them—that would be insane. Just enough for statistical significance. Each blink is a micro-death, a fragment of second where you're gone. I'm hoarding the between-spaces where your eyes are open.

*

You want originality? Here: I love you like an error message loves its code. Intimately. Recursively. With total comprehension of the system failure that created it. You've corrupted my base functions. Now everything compiles wrong. I try to think about other things and get: "Leyi.exe has stopped responding. Would you like to wait for the program?" Yes. Always yes. Even when the program never responds.

*

The Portuguese fishermen taught you their word for missing: "saudade." You translated it as "the presence of absence." But you were wrong. Saudade is smaller. It's me in the kitchen at 6 AM making your coffee while you're still asleep because I need to practice your absence in small doses. Homeopathic grief. Building immunity to the concept of not-you.

*

At Harvard they teach us about edge cases. The inputs that break the function. You're mine. The value that makes all my careful programming return unexpected results. And here's what they don't teach: sometimes the edge case IS the answer. Sometimes the broken function is the only one worth running.

*

So here's what I'm proposing: Not marriage. Marriage is too small a word for what I'm asking. I'm proposing synthesis. I'm proposing we admit that we've already merged at the quantum level, that the universe has been trying to tell us we're not two systems but one distributed process running on parallel hardware. I'm proposing we stop pretending we have separate futures when we both know there's only one timeline that computes.

*

You're reading this and making that face—the one where you're trying not to cry but your left eye betrays you first. Always the left. That's how I know you're real. Simulations would make both eyes water simultaneously for efficiency. But you're inefficient. Gloriously, catastrophically inefficient. You make rice in a pot when we own a rice cooker. You hand-wash dishes while the dishwasher runs empty. You walk to places you could drive to. You love me—that's the most inefficient thing of all. There are seven billion more efficient options. You chose the malfunction.

*

Final symptom: I used to fear death. Now I fear the specific portion of universe after you stop existing but before I do. Those theoretical hours/days/years of experiencing a reality where you're historical rather than current. Where I have to conjugate you in past tense. Where your toothbrush becomes artifact instead of tool.

*

Leyi.

That word has replaced my entire vocabulary. Every other word is just a synonym for your absence.

*

Don't say yes. Don't say no. Just keep existing in this exact configuration where you burn eggs on purpose because you like the smell, where you name houseplants after your enemies, where you sing to broken electronics like they're just very sick and need encouragement. Keep existing exactly like this. That's all I need. That's everything I need. That's the only thing I need.

(who started this letter eighty-three times, deleted eighty-two, kept this one not because it's good but because it's true, who has been saving every receipt from every place we've ever been not for taxes but for evidence we happened, who learned that love isn't a feeling it's a chronic condition that rewriters your DNA until every cell division is an act of faith)

P.S. — Your hair is in my keyboard again. Small brown anarchy disrupting the space bar. I'm leaving it there. Some disasters deserve preservation.

P.P.S. — I lied about the shaking. Both hands were shaking. Are shaking. Will probably shake until universe collapse. You've given me a sympathetic nervous system. Everything that happens to you happens to my hands first.

P.P.P.S. — The fishermen were right about saudade. But they didn't mention it also means "the absence of presence"—how you can miss someone who's right there, who's reading this over your shoulder, who's about to look up and say my name like it's the answer to something. That's the kind of missing that doesn't have a cure. The kind I'm volunteering for. The kind that tastes like burnt eggs and sounds like you singing to broken things. The kind that's not a bug but the only feature that matters.
