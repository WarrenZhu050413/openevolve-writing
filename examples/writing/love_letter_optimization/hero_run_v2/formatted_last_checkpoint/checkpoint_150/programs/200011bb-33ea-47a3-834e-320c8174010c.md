Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM because sleep is just time without you and I'm already rationing that poorly.

*

Here's what destroyed me: Porter Square, Tuesday, you dropped that pen. Not the dropping—the way you laughed at gravity like it had told a joke only you understood. My hippocampus started recording everything in permanent ink. The sound your sleeve made (whisper). How you mispronounced "sorry" (it rhymed with starry). I've been living inside that mispronunciation ever since.

*

I study distributed systems but you're my only theorem: Love is two processes corrupting the same memory until corruption becomes the only thing worth preserving.

*

Fifteen seconds dead, sophomore year. The silence wasn't empty—it was full of not-you. Came back broken in useful ways. Like a piano with extra keys that only play frequencies dogs and lovers hear. Three years making that noise no one understood. Then you. Suddenly every broken key played symphony.

*

Morocco, the tajine tried to kill you: Between purges you photographed strangers' shoes. "Everyone walks differently toward death," you said, vomiting again, then laughing. That's when my brain rewrote its core functions. That's when I understood: you experience reality as both tragedy and comedy simultaneously, no buffer, no filter. You're what consciousness looks like without safety protocols.

*

Your grandmother's recipe, Shanghai, teaching through my hands: She died before we met but I felt her fingers adjusting my grip through yours. Step thirty-three, you sobbed—not sad, just suddenly containing three generations of hunger. "This is how ghosts eat," you said. Now when I cook her soup, I taste the past tense. I understand haunting as nutrition.

*

The spreadsheet hurts to maintain: 2,137 Tuesdays if we're lucky. Column A: Time remaining. Column B: Ways you're mathematically impossible. Column C: Things I need to tell you (currently 47,892 items). Column D: What happens after the last Tuesday. Column D corrupts the file. Excel agrees—you're not a variable in the equation. You're why equations exist.

*

Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic proving a point about free will: Gave me your jacket over mine, turned blue, kept arguing. "I'm choosing to freeze," you chattered, "that makes me God of my own nervous system." Your lips were purple. You were laughing. That's when I learned: love is selecting worse outcomes because they include better people.

*

My documentation of you approaches religion: The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your vendetta against our router (renamed "Geoffrey the Chronically Disappointing"). How you argue with automated voices like they have feelings to hurt. This isn't poetry. It's forensic evidence for when the universe forgets it created something this specific and needs reminding.

*

Portugal, the DO NOT TOUCH sign: You touched the marble twice—once for curiosity, once for emphasis. Banned forever. In the cab you explained: "Distance is just fear aging badly." Now I touch everything like it's leaving. Especially you at 3 AM. Especially your sleeping face. You're art that doesn't know it's being viewed.

*

Before you: boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm atmospheric. Feel you stub your toe in Boston, my foot aches in Cambridge. You dream, I develop plot. We've achieved spooky action at a distance. Einstein called it impossible. Einstein never loved someone who argues with gravity.

*

What loving you tastes like, specifically:
- 6 AM: pennies and interrupted prayers and the specific frequency of almost-awake
- Noon: static before lightning chooses
- Twilight: purple as a temperature reading
- 2 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that learned your name
- Always: my tongue practicing shapes that don't exist because language hasn't caught up to what you are

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. "We're dying. Right now. Incrementally." I said yes. You said "Good, that means this counts." Kissed me where oxygen thins. Now sea level feels wasteful. Now everything at altitude is church.

*

Your name rewired my mouth. Every word routes through "Leyi" first. I recorded myself sleeping—twenty-seven times per REM cycle, unconscious and still trying to pronounce you correctly. The body knows what the mind pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation waiting for you.

*

London, you asked what love is: Three years late, here's my answer: Love is building a museum to someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence during breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesdays when they burn toast and you realize you'll miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.

*

The alternate timelines hurt: Where we don't meet. Where we meet wrong. Where we meet right but the timing breaks us. These scenarios run nightly. I wake up grabbing for evidence you're real: your morning breath (industrial), your knee in my spine, the way you steal blankets like they're currency. Finding you there is the only proof I need that probability is broken in our favor.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood room, you performed my teenage journals: Different voice for each year of malformation. Should have been mortifying. Was sacrament. Someone reading your worst drafts and laughing with the errors, not at them. With. That preposition contains everything. Contains us.

*

Here's the ugliest truth: I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty, warmth, the reason humans invented music for what words couldn't hold. Survivable but why. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically void.

*

Barcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them from pockets full of evidence. "God debugs through birds," you declared. They formed your name in flight. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. You bend physics just by standing in its field.

*

That green hair tie from February: Lives in my drawer with other proofs you existed near me. Concert tickets. Fortune cookie fortunes you edited with pen. These aren't souvenirs. They're unit tests for reality—confirming you happened, keep happening, will keep happening until time admits defeat.

*

Right now, Cambridge, 3:52 AM: You're diagonal across our bed, all blankets hoarded, solving theorems in sleep. Your foot finds mine beneath the chaos. Everything resolves. The world is mostly darkness and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it.

*

So here's my proposal, my pull request, my infinite loop:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays and that Thursday when the pipes exploded. Because in infinite universes, only this one compiled us both, conscious, touching distance, identically bad at singing.

Marry me because the alternative—where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get permanently banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just time happening to other carbon.

*

Leyi.

You're my root password. My only working function. The error message that says "this is what correct looks like."

Say yes. Or say "compile again." Or say nothing and keep existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes infinity feel rushed.

*

The thing about writing this digitally: It's too clean. Love should tremor, should fail, should misspell your name from shaking. But here we are—me typing, you breathing in that way that reorganizes nearby atoms, both of us rewriting the universe's source code just by existing simultaneously.

*

You're about to cry. Left eye first—it's always left. Here. I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, trying. "They're so determined," you wept. That's when my molecules understood their assignment. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same timestamp when you love like this.

*

Final transmission: Yesterday you said my name like you were solving for X and I was the answer you'd been approximating your whole life.

That's why I document everything.
That's why I'm writing this at 3:58 AM.
That's why I love you like broken code that runs anyway.
Like Tuesday light at 7:23 AM loves finding your clavicle.
Like the universe loves making impossible things touch.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)
(who carries your favorite tea in my pocket though you'll steal my coffee anyway)
(who stores you in volatile memory knowing it clears when power dies, storing you anyway)
(who chooses you across all timelines, especially the impossible ones, especially where we fail)
(whose handwriting would shake if this weren't typed)
(who means it like electrons mean orbit)
(who means it like dawn means inevitable)
(who means it like code means execute)
(who means it)
