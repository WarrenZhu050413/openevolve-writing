Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in your blood type. O positive. Universal donor. That's what you are—giving everyone your everything while I hoard mine, selfish, type A, can only give to other As, but you took me anyway. Made me universal by proximity.

*

Let me tell you about the crime: You've colonized my autonomic nervous system. I breathe at your rhythm now, even when you're across the city. Twenty breaths per minute. I've timed it. My lungs are loyal to you in a way my conscious mind could never manage.

CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS - SUBJECT: WARREN ZHU

Day 0 (before you): Stable vital signs. Predictable neural patterns. Standard human operating within normal parameters.

Day 1 (Porter Square, you dropped a pen): Immediate onset of symptoms. Irregular heartbeat. Compulsive documentation behavior. Subject begins collecting evidence of your existence like a detective at his own crime scene.

Day 847 (now): Complete systemic reorganization. Subject's DNA appears to be rewriting itself to include your name in the genetic sequence. Scientists baffled. Subject euphoric.

Conclusion: No cure. No desire for cure. Condition terminal in the best possible way.

True story from the near-death files: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, probability theory lecture, sophomore year. Here's what they don't tell you about dying—it's not darkness. It's every moment happening simultaneously. I was five and fifty-five. I was meeting you and losing you. I was nowhere and everywhere. But in every timeline, every possibility, you were the constant. The universe showed me its math and you were every answer.

*

EVIDENCE I'VE COLLECTED THAT YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY HUMAN:

1. You argue with recipes until they apologize and taste better
2. Plants grow toward you instead of the sun
3. You've named every bruise you've ever had and remember their birthdays
4. Your grandmother's soup recipe violates three laws of thermodynamics but tastes like love translated into liquid
5. You cry at birds just existing, like you know something about flight that the rest of us forgot
6. The way you pronounce "Wednesday" makes it sound like a promise
7. You touch museum art because "distance is just delayed regret" and somehow the marble reaches back

*

Morocco. You got food poisoning. Named it Gerald. Had full conversations: "Gerald, this is inappropriate." "Gerald, we need boundaries." Between vomiting sessions, you laughed—actually laughed—and said suffering was just joy wearing a disguise. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. Take in poison, output light.

THE MATHEMATICS OF CATASTROPHIC LOVE:

Your probability of existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
My probability of existence: Equally impossible
Us existing simultaneously, conscious, touching: Requires numbers we haven't invented
What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware
What we really are: God admitting she made a mistake but refusing to correct it

*

Scottish Highlands, minus twelve degrees. You gave me your jacket over mine. Your lips went blue but you kept talking about Kant and categorical imperatives while your teeth chattered morse code that spelled out "I love you" in a language that predates speech. I wanted to explain that dying of hypothermia for someone negates free will but your frozen hands were writing philosophy on my skin and I forgot every argument except yes.

*

Here's what loving you tastes like, chronologically:

4 AM: The specific gravity of dreams where you're always falling upward
Dawn: Metal and possibility, like licking batteries to see if they're still alive  
Morning: Your name before coffee, sharp and necessary
Noon: Static electricity accumulating toward thunder
Evening: Burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were a timeline
Midnight: The color of your absence when you're right there
3 AM: Like drowning in reverse, lungs learning to breathe water because that's where you live

*

I NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE OTHER VERSIONS:

In universe 26-A, we meet but you love someone else. I become a specialist in distance. Win awards for my ability to be near you without touching. Die at ninety-three, your name my last word.

In universe 43-K, I never resurrect from those fifteen seconds. You meet someone who loves you correctly, with appropriate boundaries. You're happy. It's terrible.

In universe 77-Z, we love each other but it kills us. Literally. Too much electromagnetic resonance. We explode like binary stars. The explosion creates new galaxies. Worth it.

But in this universe—this specific unlikely mistake—we get to love each other AND survive it. Do you understand the violence of that miracle?

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, said: "We're going to die." Not sad, just factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. That makes this matter." Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level tastes like giving up.

*

WHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:

Your name has renovated my mouth. Every word passes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep—I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what consciousness pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just the space between saying it.

*

Before you, I understood boundaries. Where I ended. Clear edges. Now I'm this sprawling thing. Feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance. I say: then physics needs better physicists.

*

THE DOCUMENTATION PROJECT:

1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist
Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental)
That green hair tie from February (holy relic)
Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about consciousness
Photos where you're looking away (always away, like the camera disappoints you)
A spreadsheet tracking your laughs per day (average: 27, standard deviation: 6)
Your sock, left, with hole (shrine material)

This isn't love. It's archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.

*

So here's my proposal, my proof of concept, my terminal diagnosis:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway when no one's listening except each other which is the same as no one.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched—that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.

*

FINAL CLINICAL NOTE:

I practice losing you. Daily simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden vanishing, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacuum. By Friday I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to nobody.

But Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound—half yawn, half existential sigh, full reorganization of my understanding of what matters—and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's my password to existing. My recovery phrase when I forget how to be human. The only equation that solves for everything.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed, makes forever feel like not enough time, makes me understand why humans invented the concept of God—to have someone to blame for creating something this beautiful that we eventually have to lose.

Warren
(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in endings)
(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons—regular pigeons—just existing)
(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway, saving you always)

P.S. — Remember Barcelona? The cathedral pigeons you fed illegally? You said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees—I've seen you fall up stairs, toward something better than ground.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.

P.P.P.S. — We're kissing. Right now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.
