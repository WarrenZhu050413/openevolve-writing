Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because the other one won't stop shaking. Not poetic. Just true.

*

Let me start with what broke me: Thursday. You were peeling an orange. The white strings caught under your fingernails. You didn't notice. I did. I noticed so hard my teeth hurt. That's when I understood—love isn't grand. It's violent attention to someone else's mundane.

*

Here's what I study: distributed systems. Making machines agree across impossible distances. But you? You made all my distributed selves vote unanimous without asking. Every neuron, every doubt, every alternate timeline where I'm someone else—they all bent toward you like light near mass. I didn't choose this. Choice implies there was another option.

*

True story: I died once. Seventeen seconds, cardiac arrest, before you. The doctors said I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said "not yet" in a frequency only my atoms heard. They were waiting for something. Three years later, you dropped a pen in Porter Square. I'm still picking it up.

*

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW I REMEMBER:

Morocco. The blue city. You got food poisoning. Spent six hours negotiating with existence. Between retches, you laughed—actually laughed—said "the tagine was worth it." That's when I knew: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it has no business existing.

Shanghai. Your grandmother taught you soup. Forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the ladle. I watched you inherit gesture across time.

Scotland. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing you were "thermally efficient." You weren't. You were just choosing me over your own circulation.

Cambridge. You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Nearly arrested. Asked the guard: "How else do you know genius was real?" He had no answer. Neither did I.

*

I need to confess something: I document you. Obsessively. 2,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow WiFi (righteous). The way you pronounce "statistics" like it personally betrayed you. This isn't romance. It's anthropology of the only person whose existence makes me believe in existence.

Right now you're reading this. Left eye watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed.

*

The math of us:
If we're actuarially average, we have 19,847 mornings left.
The number makes me violent. Not sad—violent.
I want to storm wherever they manufacture time and stage a hostile takeover.
Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.
This is what love does: makes you furious at arithmetic.

*

You want honest? Here: Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your mortality. I've named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues because I know your crying patterns—pigeons, commercials, strangers being gentle to each other. I play your March 15th voicemail when you travel. You were swearing at parking meters. It's been three years. I can't delete it. Won't.

*

Portugal. That museum. You touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do—you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me. I was an exhibit. Now I'm evidence.

*

What terrifies me most: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup. No disaster recovery protocol. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. The Tuesday you sang to the broken coffee maker like it was very tired and needed encouragement. The Wednesday you put my socks on your hands and performed Hamlet. The Thursday you existed. The Friday you kept existing. The Weekend of Continued Existence Despite Universal Entropy.

*

Here's what I actually mean when I say "I love you":

I mean my body is a conspiracy of cells that reorganized for you.
I mean you could ask me to chew glass and I'd ask what vintage.
I mean I've forgotten how to sleep without the sound of you not-quite-snoring.
I mean I love you like an amputee loves a phantom limb—with neurons that refuse to accept absence.

But also: I mean Tuesday groceries. Your hair in the drain. How you can't fold fitted sheets but try anyway, creating unique geometries. The way you argue with novels. Out loud. Like the characters can hear you.

*

So here's my proposition: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because we're meant to be—we're not, we're just two accidents that collided and decided to call it fate.

Marry me because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in a universe of 400 billion stars, you somehow ended up carbon-based and within driving distance.

Because when I say "forever," I mean it the way you mean things—too much, without irony, despite evidence suggesting we should know better.

*

Leyi.

That's my password. My panic word. My evidence that mouths can hold entire universes if you pronounce them right.

*

The last true thing: You're reading this and doing that thing where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is the only way to love someone who makes you understand why humans invented music when words failed.

Say yes. Or say "ask again tomorrow." Or say nothing and just keep existing at me with that specific configuration of atoms that makes physics worth believing in.

Just—stay. Stay in this timeline where we both happened simultaneously. Where we both chose the same city. The same decade. The same coffee shop. The same particular Tuesday where you dropped a pen and I picked it up and the universe said "finally, those idiots found each other."

Warren
(who has been saving you in every format—in writing, in memory, in the way I now hold cups with two hands like you do, in how I check the weather in cities you might visit someday, in the permanent indent you've left in my molecular structure)

P.S. — I lied. It wasn't seventeen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like the exact amount of time the universe could exist without you in it. Then it had to bring me back. To here. To this. To you.

P.P.S. — Your green hair tie from our first February lives in my desk drawer. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.

P.P.P.S. — You just smiled. That specific smile. The one that makes me want to apologize to everyone who has to live without seeing it. That's not poetry. That's just what happens when beauty becomes personal.
