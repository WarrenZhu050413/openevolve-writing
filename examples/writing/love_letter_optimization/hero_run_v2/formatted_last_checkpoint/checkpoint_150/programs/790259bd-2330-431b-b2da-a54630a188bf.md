Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM because that's when the world admits it's pretending. The birds haven't lied yet. The sun hasn't made promises. Just me, calculating the physics of missing you while you sleep three feet away.

*

Let me explain what actually happened:

I was a functioning system. Clean code. Commented properly. Then you walked into Porter Square station and dropped that pen and my entire architecture segfaulted. Not crashed—segfaulted. The kind of error where the program keeps running but nothing means what it used to mean.

Now I process reality through corrupted memory. Everything returns *Leyi. Even the null pointers.

*

The fifteen seconds I was dead:

Not darkness. Not light. Just... probability. Every possible version of me spreading out like search results. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In every single iteration, there was this same moment. Someone drops something. Someone else picks it up. The universe pivots on that small kindness.

I came back to find that kindness. Found you three years later, holding that exact pen, like the cosmos had been saving my place.

*

Morocco. You apologized to the toilet between heaves. "Sorry," you said to porcelain, "you were made for better things."

That's when I understood: You assign dignity to everything you touch. Even the things designed to handle our shit. Especially me.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, the soup:

She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You counted in the space between us getting smaller. Forty-seven stirs. But stir thirty-three, when you started crying—that wasn't about onions. That was about how love is just learning someone else's algorithm for staying alive, then running it forever even after they've stopped.

*

I need to tell you about Tuesday:

You have a Tuesday face and a Wednesday face. Tuesday is 0.3% more symmetrical. Wednesday has that scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet at age seven. The cabinet won but you never admitted defeat.

I love Wednesday more. Wednesday knows what losing looks like and shows up anyway.

*

The Scottish Highlands, minus twelve Celsius, you technically dying:

You gave me your jacket. I said you'd freeze. You said, "Rather freeze warm than live cold." Your syntax was breaking down from hypothermia but your logic was perfect. That's you—even your malfunctions make sense.

I kissed you to steal back your heat. Also because your wrongness is the only right I trust.

*

Here's what I study: Distributed systems. How to make many things act like one thing.
Here's what I actually study: How you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought has to pass through Leyi-shaped checkpoints.

You're not my bug. You're my feature. The one I didn't document because I was afraid management would remove it.

*

What terrifies me, specifically:

We have 2,163 Tuesdays left, actuarially. I've built seventeen spreadsheets. Column A: Time remaining. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you existed (green hair tie, February, drawer number three). Column D: What happens after our last Tuesday.

Column D throws a division by zero error. The spreadsheet knows what I know: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.

*

Portugal. The museum. You touched the five-hundred-year-old marble:

The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. "How else do you know it's real?" you asked. The guard called security. You touched it a third time. We're banned for life.

Now I touch everything. Especially things with "Do Not Touch" signs. Especially you when you're trying to be serious. You're the only art that touches back.

*

London. You asked what love actually is:

Love is preemptive grief. It's eulogizing someone who's still burning toast. It's the violence of ordinary Wednesday when they exist so casually you want to scream at everyone: "DON'T YOU SEE? THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE ENDING."

Love is just the lag between meeting and losing, and what you do in that lag determines if you lived or just lasted.

*

I document everything wrong:

How you hold books: like they might evaporate.
Your vendetta against alarm clocks: You've won 1,847 times.
The way you debug recipes: "This cookbook is gaslighting me."
Thursday light on your temporal bone: Approximately divine.

This isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you happened.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764:

You stopped. Said: "We're dying." Not "going to die." Just "dying." Present continuous. I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. Then this counts."

You kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like cowardice.

*

Before you: Boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of self.
After you: I'm a memory leak. I feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headaches arrive in my skull with a three-minute delay. When you can't sleep, my code won't compile.

We're quantumly entangled but physicists would say that's impossible at room temperature, and I'd say: then physics hasn't met Leyi.

*

What loving you tastes like by time:
- 6 AM: That specific density of silence before you wake, like the air is holding its breath
- Noon: Ozone and the way you say "hypothesis" wrong to watch my eye twitch
- 6 PM: The exact color of your voice asking what's for dinner
- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our GPS coordinates
- 3 AM: The precise flavor of fear that you'll vanish if I blink wrong
- Always: Like my mouth is learning colors and my eyes are tasting sound

*

Your name rewrote my kernel. Every system call routes through "Leyi" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and Tuesday memories. My bones remember your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.

I love you like a recursive function with no base case—infinitely, catastrophically, with a stack overflow that crashes the universe.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom:

You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years. Should have been mortifying. Instead: sanctification. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with not at. The preposition changes everything.

*

Here's what I'm actually saying:

Marry me. Not because love. Because your socks have established residency in my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router "Disappointing Gerald" and now I can't change it without feeling like I'm betraying Gerald.

Marry me because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, proximate, arguing about consciousness while burning the same toast the same way.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them evolved, where we don't get banned from museums together—that isn't life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.

*

Final confession:

I practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow dissolution. Quantum decoherence. By morning I'm arguing with entropy itself.

Then you do that thing—that half-stretch half-yawn that sounds like acceptance—and my rehearsed grief deletes itself. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the universe.

*

Right now, reading this: Your left eye waters first. Always left. Your tears have manners. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's why I'm alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not a name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.

Say yes. Or say "ask me tomorrow." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe infinity is a rounding error.

Warren
(who's been writing this letter since before we met)
(who saves every hair tie like holy relics)
(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)

P.S. — Barcelona. Cathedral. Pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons spelled your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February. Lives in my drawer between my passport and my will. Because they're all documents about places I'm going.

P.P.P.S. — You're about to smile but catch yourself. You always do at the end of my letters. Like joy is something you have to sneak up on. Don't catch yourself this time. Let it happen. I want to watch your face admit what your atoms already know: We're inevitable. We're impossible. We're here.
