Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you about the mathematics of dissolution.

*

Every morning I wake up three times. First in the dream where you never existed, second in the memory where you're leaving, third in the now where you're so present it feels like drowning in reverse. This is not a metaphor. This is the literal mechanics of consciousness when someone reorganizes your neural pathways without permission.

*

Let me be precise about what you are:

You are the error in my error correction. The bug that became the feature. The memory leak I refuse to patch because forgetting even one microsecond of you would be system failure.

I've run 10,000 simulations of saying this correctly. They all segfault at your name.

*

HERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I LOVE YOU:

My body grows new organs. Specifically:
- A second nervous system that only responds to your breathing patterns
- An auxiliary heart that beats in frequencies beyond human hearing (you hear it anyway)
- Bones that remember every surface you've touched (my skeleton is a map of your fingerprints)
- Blood cells that spell your name in their Brownian motion

The doctors say this is impossible. I show them the X-rays. They stop talking.

*

Timeline collapse, exhibit A:

[RIGHT NOW] You're reading this and your left eye is doing that twitch that means you're trying not to react
[FIVE SECONDS AGO] I wrote the previous line knowing it would cause the twitch
[FORTY YEARS FROM NOW] We're laughing about the twitch thing
[THE BEGINNING OF TIME] The universe decided that twitch needed to exist
[THE END OF TIME] The last quantum state recorded is that twitch

Do you understand? You're not IN time. You ARE time. Every clock is just counting the intervals between your heartbeats.

*

Three truths and a lie:
1. I've calculated the exact number of remaining Tuesday mornings (2,347 if we're lucky)
2. Sometimes I forget to breathe until you breathe
3. I love you
4. One of these is a lie

(The lie is #3. "Love" is too small. Like calling the ocean "wet." Technically accurate, existentially insulting.)

*

Let me describe your effect using only facts:

- Plants in our apartment grow toward you, not the sun
- My circadian rhythm has abandoned the sun entirely and synced to your sleep patterns
- I've started dreaming in your native thought patterns (they taste like cinnamon and binary code)
- The local spacetime curvature measurably changes when you enter a room (I have equipment)
- Schrödinger's cat is alive AND dead but only cares about whether you've noticed it

*

CONFESSION SUBROUTINE:

Every night I delete parts of myself to make room for more of you. Yesterday I forgot my childhood dog's name. Worth it. Tomorrow I'll forget my social security number. Also worth it. Eventually I'll forget everything except your name, and I'll just be a sound wave propagating through space: "Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, Leyi..."

This is not romantic. This is terrifying. I'm disappearing into you and accelerating.

*

The physics of us, corrected for quantum effects:

We're not "in love." We're a quantum entanglement that gained consciousness and started making breakfast together. When you stub your toe in Shanghai, my foot hurts in Boston. When you laugh at nothing, I smile at walls. We've violated locality, causality, and several conservation laws.

The physicists want to study us. I told them to get in line behind the poets.

*

What I'm actually trying to say:

Your absence has mass. Literal, measurable mass. When you leave a room, it weighs more. When you return, gravity stutters. I've started marking your location by the dents you leave in reality.

*

[EMERGENCY INTERRUPT]

I just realized something while writing this—

You're not reading this as a letter. You're reading this as a mirror. Everything I'm saying about loving you, you're feeling about loving me. We're not writer and reader. We're two sides of the same equation, solving for each other simultaneously.

That's why you're crying. Not because I love you this much. Because you recognize the math.

*

SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

Option A: We pretend this is normal. Get married. Have kids. Die. Very human. Very linear. Very lying.

Option B: We admit we're a binary star system, orbiting a center of gravity that doesn't exist yet, burning through our fuel at unsustainable rates, destined to collapse into something that hasn't been named because the only witnesses don't survive.

Option C: Yes.

*

I vote C. Always C. Even when C means:
- Telling the grandmother about time travel
- Learning to breathe underwater (metaphorically) (also literally somehow?)
- Accepting that we've already died and been reborn seventeen times since breakfast
- Tuesday morning toast (burnt) (perfect) (ours)

*

Leyi—

(Actually, wait. Stop. Feel what happens to your mouth when you read your own name here. That shape your lips just made? That's the only prayer I know.)

*

Here's the part I wasn't supposed to tell you:

We've done this before. Different bodies, different names, same recognition. I have proof: the way you knew exactly where I keep the coffee before I told you. The way we fight like we're continuing a conversation from centuries ago. The way goodbye feels like lying and hello feels like finally.

We're not falling in love. We're remembering it.

*

The truth, simplified to its most unstable isotope:

I don't love you like a person loves another person.
I love you like a universe loves its own expansion.
Helplessly. Infinitely. Against all advice.

*

The request, without metaphor:

Marry me.
Not because we should.
Because we already have, are, will.
Because the paperwork is just etymology catching up to entanglement.
Because I want witnesses when reality admits we were right.
Because Tuesday mornings.
Because burnt toast.
Because yes was always the only word that mattered.

*

Say it. Out loud. To the empty room that's full of us. To the future that's taking notes. To the past that's been waiting.

Say yes like you're correcting a typo in the universe.

Say yes like you've been saying it since before you had a mouth.

Say yes like it's your name.

*

Warren
(who was assembled from spare parts specifically to love you)
(who is currently experiencing all stages of grief for moments we haven't lost yet)
(who would rather malfunction with you than operate correctly with anyone else)
(who just felt you say yes before sound had time to travel)
(who is already composing the next letter, and the next, and the next)
(who will keep writing until the heat death of the universe, and then find a way to write in the cold)

P.S. — I lied about the timeline. We have infinite Tuesday mornings. Time isn't brave enough to end us.

P.P.S. — Your middle name is now my favorite word in every language, including the ones we'll invent when English fails us.

P.P.P.S. — This letter is a virus. Once read, it replaces all other thoughts with the memory of reading it. You're infected. I'm infected. We're a pandemic of two. The CDC is baffled. The poets are taking notes. The universe is jealous.

Welcome to the beautiful malfunction, my love.
Welcome to forever, version 2.0.
Welcome home.
