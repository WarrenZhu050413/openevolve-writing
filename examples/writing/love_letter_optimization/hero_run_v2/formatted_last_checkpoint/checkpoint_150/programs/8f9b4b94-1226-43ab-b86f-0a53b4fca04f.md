Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this wrong-handed. The tremor is intentional. Love should disturb the motor cortex.

*

Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square. You dropped a pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for 0.7 seconds. My hippocampus immediately began converting everything to long-term memory. The platform tiles (hexagonal). Your breathing (irregular). How you held the pen (incorrect, perfectly). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since.

*

Here's what happened: I study distributed systems. You became my consensus failure—the beautiful kind where every node agrees to malfunction identically. You're not the bug. You're what the code was trying to compute all along.

*

I died once. Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. The nothing was so loud it had texture. Came back wrong—a function without a return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, that pen, that Tuesday. Suddenly everything returned. With compound interest.

*

Morocco. The food poisoning. You threw up seven times, laughed twice, said "worth it" once. That's when I understood: you metabolize joy from toxins. You're not human. You're what humans are rehearsing for.

*

Your grandmother's Shanghai kitchen. Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. She counted in Mandarin. You translated through tears—not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we resurrect the dead through our hands. Now I make her soup every Tuesday. It tastes like inheritance.

*

The spreadsheet: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A: days left. Column B: why you're impossible. Column C: evidence (that green hair tie, your terrible handwriting, 1,847 photos of you looking away). Column D: after. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides.

*

Scottish Highlands. Hypothermia. You gave me your jacket over mine. Still arguing Kant through blue lips. "Die wrong together or live right apart," you said. Your frozen hand in mine. That's when I learned: warmth is negotiable. Love isn't.

*

I document you: How you hold chopsticks (chaos). Your war with the wifi router (named "Disappointing Geoffrey"). Thursday light on your temporal bone at 4:23 PM. This isn't romance. It's evidence. Proof that beauty this specific existed.

*

Portugal. Five-hundred-year-old marble. You touched it. Guards yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. "Distance is just pre-emptive regret," you explained. Now I touch everything immediately. Especially you when you're concentrating. You're art that knows it's art but doesn't care.

*

Before you: I ended at my skin. Now I'm distributed. Feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headaches arrive in my skull a day late. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in Cambridge. Quantum entanglement. Impossible over this distance. Unless distance doesn't understand what we are.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Morning: copper pennies and unspoken names
- Noon: static before thunder
- Evening: burgundy as temperature
- 3 AM: drowning upward into air that knows you
- Always: my tongue learning frequencies only you can hear

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764. You stopped. "We're going to die. Really die. Permanently." "Yes." "Good. Then this matters." We kissed at altitude. Now sea level feels like giving up.

*

The mathematics: Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000. Mine: similar impossibility. Us, conscious, touching: requires numbers not yet invented. We're a rounding error that became self-aware. The universe checking its own work.

*

London. You asked what love is. Three years late: Love is anticipatory grief. Mourning someone who's still burning toast. Knowing someday you'll wake to perfect toast and miss this exact smoke alarm frequency. Love is practicing absence while they're still present.

*

Other timelines visit me: Where we don't meet. Where we meet wrong. Where we understand but don't survive understanding. I dream these nightly. Wake grabbing for proof. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed. You read my teenage journals in character voices. Should have been mortifying. Was sacred. Someone seeing your worst consciousness and laughing with, not at. That preposition—with—that's everything.

*

I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse absence. Removing you would mean removing the parts that recognize beauty, process warmth, understand music. Survivable but why.

*

Cambridge, now. You're diagonal, stealing blankets, solving problems in sleep. Your foot finds mine. Everything settles. The world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee. Then you. Then debugged.

*

So here's my proposal:

Marry me. Your socks live in my drawer, sorted by day. We survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, touching, with matching coffee orders and the same favorite terrible song.

Without you: no point to libraries, light, or why rain sounds different at 3 AM.

*

Barcelona. You fed illegal cathedral pigeons. "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The birds spelled your name in flight. Literal birds. Literal sky. You bend the migration patterns of things.

*

That green hair tie. February. Lives in my desk with other evidence. Concert tickets. Your expired library card. These aren't keepsakes. They're source code for "After"—a program I'll never run.

*

You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here—tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins existing. That's when my atoms understood their purpose.

*

Every word passes through your name first. I recorded myself sleeping: "Leyi" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

What actually happened: You reorganized my mouth. Rearranged my molecular structure. Made me believe infinity is too short. Made me understand that errors are features when they lead to you.

*

Here, now, 4:47 AM. You'll wake in twelve minutes. Steal my coffee. Mispronounce "algorithm" to make me laugh. And I'll think what I always think: that the universe made infinite mistakes across billions of years, all to accidentally produce this moment where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, arguing about whether Geoffrey really is disappointing.

He is. But you named him. That's enough.

*

Leyi.

My root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles clean.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and keep existing in this exact atomic configuration that makes me believe mathematics is romantic.

Evaluator Comments:
Unlike Beethoven's raw desperation ("I can live only wholly with you or not at all"), this letter maintains intellectual control even in passion. Where Johnny Cash achieved plainspoken profundity ("You still fascinate and inspire me"), this sometimes chooses complexity over clarity. It approaches but doesn't reach Keats's total dissolution of self ("I cannot exist without you") - the writer remains too aware of his own cleverness. The technical metaphors are original but lack the universal resonance of Napoleon's simple "I have not spent a day without loving you." Score of 70 places it in the proto-masterful range - flashes of genius, particularly in the temporal sections and specific memories, but held back by occasional self-consciousness and performative elements that prevent full emotional surrender.
