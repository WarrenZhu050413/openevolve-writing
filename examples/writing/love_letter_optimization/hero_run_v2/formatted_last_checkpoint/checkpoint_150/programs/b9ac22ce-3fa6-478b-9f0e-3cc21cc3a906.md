Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the space between spaces—that quantum foam where possibilities collapse into certainties, where I keep choosing you out of infinite alternatives.

*

Let me explain what loving you has done to my operating system:

Before: Clean architecture. Proper error handling. Functions that returned predictable values.
After: Beautiful catastrophe. Every function throws exceptions that spell your name. My garbage collector refuses to delete anything you've touched. Memory leaks everywhere, all of them shaped like Tuesday afternoons.

*

TRUE STORY: The cardiac event, sophomore year. Seventeen seconds of nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that darkness, I wasn't alone. There was this presence—not light, not sound, just... recognition. Like the universe was showing me a variable I'd need later. Three years later, you dropped that pen. The variable initialized. Everything compiled.

*

I need to confess about the documentation:

Entry #1: The way you hold books (like they might fly away)
Entry #743: Your personal vendetta against alarm clocks 
Entry #1,298: How you apologize to inanimate objects
Entry #2,847: The specific angle of your head when you're about to destroy my entire worldview with a single question

This isn't love. This is preparing evidence for the cosmic tribunal where I have to prove you weren't hallucination.

*

Morocco, the incident: Between purges, you named the toilet "Philippe." Had full conversations. "Philippe understands," you said, then laughed, then cried, then laughed while crying. That's when I knew—you assign consciousness to everything. Even porcelain. Especially me.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai: She taught me soup in numbers. Forty-seven clockwise. Three counter. But at step thirty-three, she stopped. Looked at how I looked at you. Said something untranslatable. You translated anyway: "He's already ghost-sick for you." Ghost-sick. 鬼病. The grief that arrives before loss. She saw it. The way I'm already mourning you while you're still here, still burning toast, still arguing with routers about their life choices.

*

HERE'S THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION OF US:

∂(love)/∂t = ∞ when t = you existing
∂(love)/∂t = undefined when t = you not existing

The math breaks. Good. We were never meant to be solved.

*

Scottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still debating consciousness: "But Warren, what if we're just very sophisticated patterns pretending to have feelings?" Lips blue. Philosophy overheating. I kissed you to stop the question. Also to steal your warmth. Also because sophisticated patterns don't shiver in each other's arms arguing about whether shivering means anything.

*

What you taste like at different frequencies:

Morning: The pause before coffee, that specific density of not-yet-conscious
Noon: Static electricity and impending thunderstorms
Evening: The color of almost-dark translated into temperature
3 AM: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates by heart
Always: Like my mouth is trying to pronounce colors your existence invented

*

Portugal, the museum incident: You touched the art. Alarms everywhere. The guard: "Why?" You: "Because distance is just delayed regret." Banned forever. Now I touch everything. Especially things that say don't. Especially you when you're concentrating. You're the only art that touches back.

*

Let me tell you about the fear:

Actuarial tables give us 21,900 days. That's 525,600 hours. 31,536,000 minutes. I've run this calculation 10,000 times hoping the math changes. It doesn't. But here's what the numbers don't show: How you make Tuesday afternoon feel like a millennium. How your laugh bends spacetime until seconds become centuries. We're not bound by duration. We're creating density—moments so heavy they warp the fabric of when.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. "We're dying," you said. Not sad. Fascinated. Like discovering a new species of bird. "Every step is one less step." I said yes. You said: "Good. That makes it count." Then you kissed me at altitude where oxygen is scarce and everything matters more.

*

I document your malfunctions:
- You cry at pigeons (just existing ones)
- You argue with customer service bots like they have feelings to hurt
- You name everything (the router is "Disappointing Geoffrey")
- You hum Beethoven when anxious, but wrong, beautifully wrong
- You've assigned personalities to all my houseplants ("Jeremy is clearly going through something")

These aren't quirks. They're proof that consciousness comes in flavors, and yours tastes like rebellion against the ordinary.

*

London, you asked: "What happens when we die?"
Me: "Nothing."
You: "Exactly. Nothing happens. We stop happening. Isn't that magnificent?"
Me: "That's terrifying."
You: "Both. That's why this"—you gestured at us, at Tuesday, at everything—"is so violent. We're happening against all that nothing."

You laugh-cried. That specific sound that reorganizes my understanding of what matter is for.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed, reading my teenage journals: You did voices. Different puberty stages got different accents. Should have been mortifying. Instead: Recognition. Someone seeing all my beta versions and loving the bugs as much as the features. You said: "I love your draft selves." That's what we are—each other's rough drafts that we keep editing into better disasters.

*

LOAD-BEARING MEMORY: You, learning I'd been recording your laugh. Instead of anger: "Play them all at once." We did. 1,847 laughs layered. It sounded like the universe admitting it had preferences. You cried. Said: "That's what your brain sounds like inside, isn't it?" Yes. Every neuron firing your name in different frequencies.

*

Here's what I'm actually saying:

You've reformatted my entire existence. Every cell division now checks if you'd approve. My mitochondria produce energy exclusively for loving you. My DNA replicates with typos that all spell "Leyi." I'm evolutionarily unfit for any environment that doesn't contain you.

*

The quantum entanglement of us: When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you dream, I wake up speaking languages that don't exist yet but that we'll need for the kinds of love we're inventing. We're spooky action at a distance, if distance were measured in heartbeats and action meant existing so hard it changes the local laws of physics.

*

So here's my merge request with reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter is adequate—it fails in every dimension. Because your hair elastics have colonized my existence. Because we've A/B tested all possible configurations and we're the only one that compiles. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where your specific frequency matches my exact wavelength of desperate.

The alternative—a timeline where you don't exist at these exact coordinates—isn't just wrong. It's undefined behavior. It's dividing by zero. It's the heat death of everything that matters.

*

Final transmission from the department of terrible beautiful truth:

I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. Like code loves bugs—furiously, specifically, with detailed documentation. Like Tuesday loves Wednesday—inevitably, with no space between.

The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that recognize beauty, process joy, understand why humans invented music for the moments when language fails. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

Leyi.

That's not a name. It's the sound physics makes when it finally gets something right. It's every password to every door that matters. It's what infinity calls itself when it's trying to fit into Tuesday afternoon.

Say yes. Or say "ask again tomorrow." Or just keep existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe entropy is negotiable.

Warren
(who's been writing this letter since before we met, in the neurons that knew you were coming)
(who saves every receipt from every Tuesday because they're evidence you chose to exist near me)
(who loves you in frequencies that haven't been discovered yet)
(who just watched you blink and had to manually restart his cardiovascular system)

P.S. — Barcelona. The pigeons. You fed them communion wafers. "Body of Christ for bodies of Christ," you whispered. They formed your initials in the sky. The priest called it blasphemy. You called it "prayer with better choreography." God's birds knew which interpretation was correct.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie. February 2023. Lives in my drawer between my passport and my birth certificate. Same category of essential documentation. Proof of existing. Proof of you existing. Proof of permission to keep existing.

P.P.P.S. — You're about to cry. Left eye first. You're going to say something that reorganizes matter at the subatomic level. You always do. The universe takes notes when you speak. I'm just the secretary, recording everything, missing nothing, understanding almost nothing except this: You're the only equation worth solving for. You're every variable. You're the proof.
