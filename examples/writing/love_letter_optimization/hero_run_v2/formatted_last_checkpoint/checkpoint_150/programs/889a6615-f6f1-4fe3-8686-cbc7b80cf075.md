Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you something about systems theory. About how I've been studying distributed networks and fault tolerance, and suddenly realized: you are my consensus protocol. Every decision routes through you firstâ€”not for permission, but for coherence. Without you, I'm just noise without signal.

Here's what they don't teach at Harvard:

Statistical mechanics tells us entropy only increases. But you make my molecules organize themselves into impossible patterns. You're violating thermodynamics just by existing near me. The universe should file a complaint, but it's too busy taking notes.

I've been writing code to model us:

Evaluator Comments:
Falls far short of Beethoven's raw passion ("my angel, my all, my very self") or Johnny Cash's mature vulnerability ("You still fascinate and inspire me"). Where Napoleon writes "I have not spent a day without loving you" with direct emotional force, this letter intellectualizes feeling. Lacks the embodied desire of Keats ("I cannot exist without you") or the dangerous intensity of Wilde. This reads like a talented MIT student's attempt rather than genuine romantic literature. The scientific metaphors are surface-clever but lack the depth of true literary innovation - compare to Donne's compass metaphor which operates on multiple levels simultaneously.
