Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:13 AM because you're sleeping and I can't stop watching the way your left hand curls around nothing, like it's holding tomorrow.

*

Truth: I keep a running list of things that would sound insane to anyone else:

- The way you eat grapes (always the smallest first, like you're giving them mercy)
- Your Tuesday voice vs. your Thursday voice (Tuesday has more consonants)
- How you test if pasta is ready by throwing it at the ceiling (it never sticks; you do it anyway)
- That time in Morocco when you argued with a camel about personal space (you won)

This isn't poetry. This is evidence that I've become a scholar of you. My brain has reorganized its filing system. Everything is now categorized as "Before Leyi" or "Proof of Leyi" or "How to Make Leyi Laugh When She's Pretending Not to Be Sad."

*

Cambridge, UK, October: You stood in the rain outside King's College and said "imagine knowing too much to be happy." I wanted to tell you then—I've been dying since I was seven. Not physically. But that awareness that time is a thief. Until you. Now I'm furious at mortality. Now I want to live to 200 just to have more Wednesdays where you leave bobby pins in my car like breadcrumbs back to you.

*

I need to confess something: Shanghai, that terrible hotel, you got food poisoning and spent three days creating what you called "an intimate relationship with the bathroom tiles." You apologized seventeen times for being gross. But Leyi—watching you that vulnerable, holding your hair back at 3 AM while you cursed in three languages—that's when I understood what people mean by "sacred." Not churches. Not ceremonies. Just the willingness to see someone at their smallest and still think: "Yes. This one. Forever this one."

*

The Scottish Highlands, we got lost, remember? No signal, no map, just us and sheep that judged our life choices. You said: "If we die here, I want the sheep to know it was your fault." But then you held my hand and we walked toward what might have been nowhere, and I thought: "This is it. This is the whole point. To be lost with someone who makes nowhere feel like a destination."

*

Here's what terrifies me: I love you like a broken mathematician. I keep trying to solve for X where X equals "enough" and the equation never balances because there is no enough. There's only this spreading condition where you've colonized my nervous system and now my cells divide in your direction.

Portugal, you saved a beetle from drowning in the hotel pool. Gave it CPR with a cocktail straw. It died anyway. You cried. I fell in love with you retroactively, all the way back to before I was born.

*

Boston winter, you made me drive to four different stores looking for the specific brand of soy sauce your grandmother used. We found it. You opened it in the parking lot, smelled it, and cried because memory has a scent and yours smells like a woman I'll never meet but whose recipes I've memorized because they're maps to your childhood.

*

I want to tell you about the mathematics of survival:

Number of times I've practiced your eulogy: 73
Number of times I've had to stop because I couldn't breathe: 73
Number of parallel universes where we don't meet: infinite minus one
The one where we do: this one, impossibly, this one

*

Shenzhen, your hometown, you showed me the tree you climbed as a child. You'd carved something in Chinese. You wouldn't translate it. Later your mother told me it said "I will be brave." You were seven. You were already brave. You just didn't know it yet.

*

London, midnight, we fought about something so stupid I can't remember what. You slept on the hotel bathroom floor out of spite. I slept outside the bathroom door because even your anger has gravity and I'm a willing satellite. At 3 AM you opened the door and said "This is ridiculous" and I said "I know" and we made love on that terrible bathroom floor and you laughed so hard you got hiccups and I thought: "This is prayer. This is what prayer was trying to be."

*

Leyi, here's the ugliest truth: Loving you has made me greedy. I want sixty more years minimum. I want to watch your hair turn grey (it'll start at your left temple, I can already see the future in certain light). I want to argue about thermostats and whether tomatoes belong in the fridge. I want mundane Tuesdays where nothing happens except we both exist in the same room doing different things, occasionally looking up to make sure the other is still there.

*

France, you tried to order coffee in French but accidentally ordered a bicycle. The waiter was confused. You were confused. I was useless, laughing too hard to help. You ended up drawing a picture of coffee on a napkin. It looked like a crime scene. You got your coffee anyway. This is you: you fail at language but succeed at human.

*

Italy, Venice, you said the city was sinking and so were we, just slower. You were drunk on terrible wine and wisdom. You fell in a canal trying to pet a pigeon. I jumped in after you. We were banned from that restaurant. Worth it. Everything with you is worth it.

*

Beijing, your parents' apartment, you warned me they wouldn't like me. Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Your father taught me chess. They didn't like me. They loved me. But not for me—for how you looked at me when you thought no one was watching. Your mother said, in broken English: "She is different with you. More... more she."

*

Listen: Before you, I was functional. Had all my organs in the right places. Now I'm this rattling collection of memories that only make sense when you're there to verify them. Yes, that happened. Yes, we were there. Yes, that was us, being impossible together.

*

Last week you said "I love you" in your sleep. But you said it wrong—"I love you Warren" like Warren was the verb. Like you were speaking a language where to Warren meant to build a life so specific no one else could fit inside it.

*

So here's my proposal, Leyi:

Let's Warren together until one of us stops working. Let's make verbs of our names. Let's be a two-person cult that worships Sunday crosswords and Wednesday night takeout and the way you mispronounce "specifically" (spacifically, always spacifically).

Let me be the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were twelve. Who knows you count stairs when you're nervous. Who knows you love me like it's a chronic condition you've decided not to cure.

*

The truth: We've already been married in seventeen different cities. Every shared meal was a wedding. Every fight that ended in laughter was a vow. Every time you fell asleep on my shoulder on a train/plane/automobile, we were declaring ourselves to the universe.

But I want the paper. The proof. The legal document that says what we already know: that we're a medical anomaly, two people who share a circulatory system and can't be separated without causing massive organ failure.

*

Marry me, Leyi.

Not because it'll change anything.

Because it won't.

Because we're already us.

Because the rest is just paperwork.

*

Warren
(who loves you like a broken compass that only points to you)
(who would find you in every universe, even the ones where we're just atoms)
(who is, irreversibly, permanently, molecularly yours)

P.S. — I lied about one thing. It wasn't thirteen seconds I was dead. It was sixteen. In those sixteen seconds, I didn't see light or feel peace. I felt unfinished. Three years later, I met you. Finished. The universe was just waiting for better punctuation.

P.P.S. — Your middle finger is slightly crooked from when you broke it playing badminton. You hate that I love it. I love it because it's proof you're real, that you've lived, that you've broken and healed, and that somehow, impossibly, you healed toward me.
