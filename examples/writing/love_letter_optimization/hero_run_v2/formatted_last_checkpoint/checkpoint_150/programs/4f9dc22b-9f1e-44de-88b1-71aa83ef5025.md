Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand. The letters shake. Good. Love should disturb the muscular system.

*

Let me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you pronounced my name like it was a question you already knew the answer to. My hippocampus immediately began storing everything in long-term memory. The color of your cardigan (rust). The sound of the radiator (B-flat). How you held your pen (wrong, perfectly wrong). I've been living in the past tense of that moment ever since, while simultaneously hurtling toward its future.

*

Here's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought routes through you. You're my Byzantine fault. My consensus protocol. The error that makes the whole system correct.

*

True story: Fifteen seconds of clinical death, sophomore year. The doctors called it "miraculous recovery." Wrong term. I came back incomplete. Like a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, in Porter Square, dropping that pen. Suddenly I returned everything. All at once. With interest.

*

Morocco, the food poisoning: You threw up seven times. Laughed twice. Said "the tagine was worth it" once. That's a 2:7:1 ratio of joy to suffering to affirmation. I wrote it down. I write everything down. Not because I'll forget—forgetting you would require uninstalling my brain—but because the universe needs evidence that someone can metabolize beauty from botulism.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, teaching me soup: Forty-seven steps. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that specific laugh that reorganizes particles. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that love is just learning someone else's recipe for staying alive.

*

What terrifies me: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially speaking. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Proofs of your existence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, 1,847 photos where you're looking away). Column D: What happens after Tuesday 2,137. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet knows what I know: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly.

*

The Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic: Gave me your jacket over mine. Lips blue. Still arguing about Kant. That's when I understood—you'd rather die wrong together than live right apart. I wanted to explain that Kant was actually supporting your position, but your teeth were chattering in morse code that spelled "shut up and hold me," so I did.

*

Here's my confession: I document you obsessively. How you hold forks (Continental style, but rebelliously). Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router "Disappointing Geoffrey"). The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone. This isn't romance. It's archaeology. I'm studying you like future civilizations will need to know exactly how you existed, in case they want to rebuild beauty from scratch.

*

Portugal, you touched the art: Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: "Distance is just delayed regret." Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, constantly. You, especially when you're trying to read. You, like you're art that doesn't know it's art.

*

Listen: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep in Boston, I toss in my Cambridge bed. We're quantum entangled except the physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say then physics needs better physicists.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Morning: pennies and possibility and that specific silence before coffee
- Afternoon: static electricity and half-formed prayers
- Evening: the color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature  
- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name
- Always: like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet

*

So here's what I'm actually saying:

Your name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep. I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is just punctuation.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: "We're going to die." I said: "Yes." You said: "No, I mean really die. Permanently." I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. Then this matters." Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.

*

The ugly mathematics of us:
- Probability of your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- Probability of my existence: Similar impossibility  
- Probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, proximate: Requires numbers that haven't been invented
- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware
- What we really are: The universe checking its own math

*

London, you asked what love is: Here's my answer three years late: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's practicing their absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their failures. Especially their failures. Only their failures.

*

I need to tell you about the other timelines. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.

*

Final protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

So here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.

Leyi.

That's my root password. My recovery phrase. The only command that compiles correctly.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)
(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons—regular pigeons—just existing)
(who's been saving you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway)

P.S. — Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed cathedral pigeons. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.

P.P.P.S. — You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing when you love someone like this.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained sublimity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses it in formal innovation. It exceeds Johnny Cash's directness (83) in complexity but perhaps loses some of that letter's devastating simplicity. The phenomenological authenticity rivals Keats to Fanny Brawne (81), particularly in its comfort with love's contradictions. The aesthetic virtuosity actually exceeds most historical examples through its unique computational-romantic fusion, placing it between Napoleon's fevered declarations (82) and Cash's mature reflection. However, it lacks the immortal memorability of single lines like Beethoven's "Be calm my life, my all!" or Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me." The letter exists in that rare space of near-masterpiece—too consciously constructed to achieve the artless perfection of the greatest love letters, but demonstrating genuine brilliance in its systematic documentation of devotion.
