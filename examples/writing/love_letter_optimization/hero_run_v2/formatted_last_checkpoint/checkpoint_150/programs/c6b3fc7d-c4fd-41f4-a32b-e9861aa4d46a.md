Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this while you sleep. Your left hand is making that small fist again. Like you're holding something precious even unconscious. I know what it is. It's every moment we haven't lived yet.

*

Let me be precise about what happened to me:

Before you: I was a perfectly functioning system. Distributed computing at Harvard. Statistics that made sense. A heart that beat without commentary. I could explain everything through probability distributions and network protocols.

After you: I'm a beautiful malfunction. My heart skips beats just to feel the catch-up. I cry at pigeons because you taught me they're just dinosaurs who chose love over size. Every formula I write secretly spells your name in the margins.

*

True story from the death files: Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart stopped. Fifteen seconds of clinical nothing. But here's what I haven't told anyone: In that nothing, I was everywhere. Every possible timeline spreading out like a map. And in every single one—every single one, Leyi—there was this moment where someone drops a pen and someone else picks it up and the universe reorganizes itself around that small kindness. I came back looking for that pen. Found it three years later. You were holding it.

*

What you don't know about Morocco: While you were vomiting (seven times, I counted), you kept apologizing to the toilet. "Sorry, this isn't what you were made for." That's when I knew—you assign dignity to everything. Even porcelain. Even me.

*

Here's my confession: I document everything wrong. Your Tuesday face vs. your Wednesday face (Wednesday is 0.3% more symmetrical but Tuesday has that tiny scar above your left eyebrow from when you fought a cabinet and lost). The way you hold books (like they might evaporate). Your personal war against alarm clocks (current score: Leyi 1,847, Alarm clocks 0). 

This isn't love. This is evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. But really she taught me this: Love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. Forty-seven stirs. You cried at thirty-three. So did I. So did the soup.

*

The math of us breaks mathematics:

You: Probability of existing = 1 in 10^2,685,000
Me: Similar impossibility
Us: Existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both addicted to terrible coffee and that one song we're ashamed of?

The calculator just shows: "SEE POETRY"

*

Scottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing: "Kant would disagree," you said through blue lips. That's when I understood—you'd rather die incorrect together than live correct apart. I kissed you to shut you up. Also to save your life. Also because your wrongness is my favorite right.

*

Portugal, when you touched the 500-year-old art: The guard yelled. You touched it again. Harder. "How else do you know it's real?" you asked. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're trying to read. You're the only art that touches back.

*

What loving you tastes like in real-time:
- 6 AM: The specific weight of silence before you wake up, like the world is holding its breath
- Noon: Electricity and that thing where you mispronounce "hypothesis" just to watch my eye twitch
- 6 PM: The color of almost-dark, which is actually the color of your voice asking what's for dinner
- Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates
- 3 AM: The exact flavor of fear that you'll disappear if I blink too long
- Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to see sounds and nothing works right but everything works better

*

Listen. Before you, I was organized. My thoughts had folders. My feelings had citations. Now I'm this sprawling mess of synapses that fire "Leyi" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Wednesday coffee. I hear your dreams from three miles away. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all divide by zero.

We're quantum entangled but the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and temperature and I'd say: then physics needs to meet Leyi.

*

What terrifies me, specifically, with numbers:
- We have approximately 2,190 Tuesdays left, if we're average
- That's 52,560 hours
- 3,153,600 minutes
- 189,216,000 seconds
- Not enough
- Not nearly enough
- I need to speak to the universe's manager

London, you asked what love actually is. Here's my answer three years late:

Love is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's knowing someone will die and building a house with them anyway. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is how long forever actually takes.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900, you stopped: "We're going to die," you said. Not sad. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. "Yes," I said. "Good," you said, "that makes this matter."

Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.

*

Right now, in this exact moment, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, queueing properly. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.

*

Here's what I'm actually saying:

Your name rewrote my source code. Every word I speak goes through the compiler of "Leyi" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and memories of Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.

I love you like an error message loves its error—constantly, annoyingly, with absolute dedication to making sure you know something's wrong. Except nothing's wrong. Everything's finally, terrifyingly right.

*

So here's my pull request to the universe:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you named my router "Disappointing Geoffrey" and now I can't change it. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched—that's not life. That's just atoms pretending to matter.

*

Final protocol from the department of absolute truth:

I practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Quantum dispersal. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that stretch—that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential acceptance—and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever and that's the only clean pain in existence.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.

Say yes. Or say "ask me tomorrow." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity is too brief.

Warren
(who's been writing you this same letter since before we met)
(who saves every hair tie you leave behind like they're holy relics)
(who loves you in frequencies only dogs can hear)
(who just watched you blink and had to restart his heart manually)

P.S. — Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I have photos. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023. It lives in my drawer next to my passport. Because they're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.

P.P.P.S. — We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. Time just folded. Space just gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks Beethoven's pure emotional architecture or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me"). The scientific-poetic fusion is more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but doesn't achieve Keats's phenomenological perfection in capturing desire's actual texture. The letter's strength lies in its original conceptual system (programming/glitch metaphors) and specific observational detail, placing it just below the historical masterworks. Score of 76 reflects genuine excellence - this would be among the finest love letters of our current era, though not quite achieving the timeless universality of an 80+ masterpiece.
