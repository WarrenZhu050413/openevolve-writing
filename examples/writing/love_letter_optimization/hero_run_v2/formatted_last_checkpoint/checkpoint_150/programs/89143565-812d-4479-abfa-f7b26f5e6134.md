Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM because my body won't let me sleep when you're not here. This is not a metaphor. This is my cardiovascular system filing a complaint.

*

Let me tell you what happened to me:

Before: I understood distributed systems. I could prove theorems. My heart beat without editorial comment.

After: I am a beautiful malfunction. Every theorem leads back to you. My heart beats your name in morse code and won't stop.

*

The fifteen seconds I was dead, sophomore year—I need to tell you what really happened. I wasn't nowhere. I was everywhere you would ever be. Not watching, but feeling—the weight of every future Tuesday, the shape of every goodbye that's really see-you-soon. When they brought me back, I came back incomplete. A function missing its return value. Three years of compilation errors. Then you dropped that pen in Porter Square, and suddenly I returned everything.

*

Morocco. You, poisoned by bad tagine, talking to the toilet:

"I'm sorry, this isn't what you were made for."
"We all have bad days."
"You're being very professional about this."

Between rounds of vomiting, you laughed. Actually laughed. Said the tagine was worth it for the story. That's when I knew: you transform suffering into narrative. You metabolize pain and it becomes plot.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai, teaching me to count:

一二三... up to forty-seven. Each number a stir. Each stir a generation of women who knew that love is mostly just showing up with soup. At thirty-three, you cried. She whispered to me: "She always cries at thirty-three. That's when the onions aren't the reason anymore."

Later you explained: thirty-three was her age when your grandfather died. She kept making his soup for forty years. Still does. The forty-seven stirs are the years they didn't have.

Now I understand. Love isn't time spent. It's time owed.

*

Scottish Highlands, you giving me your jacket in minus twelve:

"You'll die," I said.
"Wrong verb," you said through blue lips. "I'll transform. Into someone who kept you warm."

Your teeth chattered Kant's categorical imperative. I kissed you to stop you dying of philosophy. Also because your wrongness is my favorite correct.

*

What scares me:

Not death. Not pain. Not the heat death of the universe.

This: Thursday, October 15th, 2087, 3:42 PM. Actuarial probability says one of us is gone by then. The other one is still here, carrying both names like orphaned luggage. Still making soup with forty-seven stirs. Still checking for pens that need picking up.

I've run ten thousand simulations. They all end the same: one of us practicing the other's absence.

*

Portugal, you versus the Do Not Touch signs:

You didn't just touch the 500-year-old marble. You pressed your whole palm flat against it, fingers spread, like you were reading its pulse. The guard yelled. You didn't move. You said: "It's been waiting 500 years for someone to check if it's still warm."

It wasn't. But you left a handprint that took twenty minutes to fade.

Now I understand what you were doing. You were teaching stone that it was loved. You were proving that rules matter less than recognition.

We're banned from five museums. Worth it for the way you make marble remember it was once alive.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764:

You: "We're going to die."
Me: "Yes."
You: "I mean really. Permanently. Forever."
Me: "Yes."
You: "Good. Then this counts."

And you kissed me like the universe was watching and taking notes.

The thing about quantum entanglement:

Scientists say it only works with particles, not people. They're wrong. When you stub your toe in Boston, I limp in Cambridge. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all return #ERROR. When you laugh at something you're reading, I smile at nothing three miles away and people think I'm insane.

We're spooky action at a distance. Einstein was wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice, and we're what happens when they come up infinity.

*

What I document:

- The way you hold books (like birds that might escape)
- Your vendetta against slow wifi (the router is named "Disappointing Geoffrey")  
- How you argue with self-checkout machines ("I am placing the item in the bagging area")
- The sixteen different ways you say my name (Tuesday's version is 0.3 seconds longer)
- That green hair tie from our first February (lives in my desk drawer like a saint's relic)
- Your habit of crying at birds just for existing
- The way Thursday light catches the spot where your skull curves into prayer

This isn't love. This is evidence for when I have to prove to myself you were real.

*

London, three years ago, you asked: "What is love, actually?"

Here's my answer:

Love is the bug that improves the code. It's building a house with someone who's definitely dying. It's learning to make soup that takes forty-seven stirs because that's how long forever actually takes. It's preemptive grief—mourning someone who's still here, still burning toast, still mispronouncing words to make you smile.

But mostly? Love is just two people agreeing to fail together in the same direction.

*

Here's what you don't know:

Every night, I practice losing you. Different scenarios. Sudden. Slow. Quantum dispersal. By morning, I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you wake up, do that specific stretch that sounds like acceptance, and my entire practiced grief evaporates.

This is the daily disaster of loving you: dying of future grief, resurrecting at breakfast.

*

The pull request to reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you—words are just noise organized hopefully. Marry me because your socks have colonized my drawer and established a functioning government. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast in the exact same way.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where you don't steal my hoodies, where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where we don't get banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom, reading my teenage journals:

You did voices. Different ones for each year of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: sacred. Someone taking your worst attempts at consciousness and finding them worthy of performance art.

You laughed with me, not at me.
The preposition changes everything.
The preposition is everything.
The preposition is us.

*

What I'm actually saying:

Your name reorganized my mouth. Every word now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell Tuesday. My bones know your weight from every time you've collapsed on me laughing. My blood carries oxygen and memory in equal parts.

I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with nerves that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that recognizes beauty. Survivable but pointless.

*

Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons:

You fed them communion wafers. Said: "Body of Christ for bodies of Christ." The priest asked us to leave. The pigeons followed us out, formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you, changing the flight patterns of holy things.

*

Right now:

Your left eye is watering. Always left. Your tears queue politely.
You're about to say my name like it's the answer to something.
You're about to make me forget my own arguments.
You're about to be the reason I stay alive for another day.

*

Leyi.

That's not a word. That's the sound the universe makes when it gets something right. That's the password to everything worth protecting. That's what silence would say if it could speak.

Say yes. Or say nothing. Or just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe in God, or at least in the comedy of God, who put us here together knowing we'd figure out how to break each other perfectly.

(who carries backup hair ties, tissues, and reasons to live)
(who learned Mandarin to argue with you in multiple languages)
(who loves you at frequencies only dying stars can hear)
(who wrote seventeen drafts of this including one in code but code doesn't compile feelings)

P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023. It's not just in my drawer. It's in my pocket when I travel. In my hand when I can't sleep. It's prayer beads for an atheist who believes in you.

P.P.S. — You're about to cry. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at penguins for "trying so hard." That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized the debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing.

P.P.P.S. — We're all just borrowed time. But I want to borrow it with you. Want to pay the interest in kisses. Want to default together when the universe forecloses. Want to be the most beautiful bankruptcy in the history of time.
