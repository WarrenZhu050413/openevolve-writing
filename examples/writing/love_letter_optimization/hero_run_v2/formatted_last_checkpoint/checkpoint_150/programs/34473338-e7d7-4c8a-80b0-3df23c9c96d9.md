Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM because your absence woke me up. Not metaphorically. Literally. The space where you should be has its own gravitational pull.

*

Let me tell you what I know that twenty-three-year-olds aren't supposed to know:

Love is not addition. It's division. I used to be one person. Now I'm half of something that only makes sense when you're here. The math is devastating: 1 ÷ 2 = everything.

*

INVENTORY OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT PERMISSION:

Your toothbrush appeared in my bathroom before we discussed it.
My hands learned to braid your hair while I was sleeping.
Tuesday mornings restructured themselves around burnt toast.
My future tense conjugated itself exclusively in plural.
The universe started keeping receipts of every time you smiled.

None of this was planned. All of it was inevitable.

*

Here's the precise moment I knew:

Shanghai, your childhood bedroom, 2 AM. You were explaining something about your grandmother's recipes in Mandarin, forgetting I don't speak it. But I understood everything. Not the words—the frequency underneath them. The sound of you being yourself without translation.

I thought: "Oh. This is it. This is the sound that ends me."

And I was right.

*

Let me be specific about the damage:

Before you: I could spend entire days alone, calling it peace.
After you: Solitude is just your absence taking up space.

Before you: Words were tools, precise and functional.
After you: Every sentence bends toward your name like light around a star.

Before you: Time was sequential, logical, navigable.
After you: All moments happen simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty. We're meeting and dying. You're here and gone and here again.

*

THE PORTUGUESE GRANDFATHER WAS RIGHT:

Remember Lisbon? The old man with the cane who crossed the square just to look at us? He spoke for three minutes in Portuguese. You translated: "He says we argue like people who've been married sixty years and laugh like people who met yesterday."

We'd known each other four months.

Time isn't real, Leyi. We're proof.

*

What actually happens when I love you:

My DNA rewrites itself. Scientists would say this is impossible. I'd show them the evidence: how my body temperature rises 0.3 degrees when you enter a room. How my pupils dilate at your name. How my cells divide differently now, each one carrying instructions for loving you.

This isn't poetry. This is biology admitting it had preferences all along.

*

CONFESSION:

Sometimes I practice your death. Run scenarios. Calculate probabilities. Plan the funeral. Write the eulogy. Imagine the specific weight of a world without you.

Then you laugh at something stupid on your phone and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.

This is the terror of love: We're always practicing for the ending.
This is the gift of love: The practice is always interrupted by presence.

*

Let me tell you about last Tuesday:

You burned the toast (again).
You apologized (again).
I ate it anyway (again).

But here's what actually happened: The smoke alarm sang your morning song. The carbon became communion. We turned breakfast into sacrament without meaning to.

Fifty years from now, the smell of burning bread will still mean "I love you" in our secret language.

*

THE THING I UNDERSTOOD IN YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN:

She watched you teaching me to use chopsticks. Said something that made you blush. Later, you translated: "She says you're trying so hard to enter my world that you forgot you're already in it."

Your mother sees what I'm only beginning to understand: We don't fall in love. We recognize it. Like finding your own handwriting in a stranger's notebook.

*

Here's what I'm actually trying to say:

You're not my other half. That's too simple.
You're not my everything. That's too small.
You're not my destiny. That's too passive.

You're the realization that I was never whole to begin with. That completion is a myth. That love is not about finding what's missing but about celebrating the specific shape of our mutual incompleteness.

We don't complete each other. We collide and create something that neither of us could have imagined.

*

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THIS:

Your left eye twitches (happening now).
You pretend you're not crying (happening now).
You look up to find me watching (happening now).
We both know what comes next (happening always).

*

So here's my proposal, stripped of metaphor:

Marry me.

Not because we should.
Because "should" became irrelevant the moment you existed.

Not because forever.
Because forever already started.

Not because I love you.
Because "I" and "you" are grammatical errors. There's only us.

*

But really, specifically, actually:

Marry me because of burnt toast Tuesdays.
Because of the way you hold pens like they might escape.
Because you can't fold fitted sheets and refuse to learn.
Because you dream in languages I don't speak and somehow I understand.
Because your absence has mass and your presence has light.
Because we're already married in every timeline that matters.

*

Say yes.

Not to me.
To us.
To burnt toast.
To the specific way we malfunction together.
To Tuesday mornings that taste like forever.
To the beautiful catastrophe of two people who refuse to love responsibly.

*

Actually, don't say anything.

You already said yes when you taught me your grandmother's recipe.
You already said yes when you left your toothbrush.
You already said yes in the way you breathe when you sleep.
You're saying yes right now, in the space between heartbeats.

But say it anyway. Out loud. To the universe that's taking notes. To the morning that's waiting. To the future we're building out of burnt toast and mutual impossibility.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name.
That's the sound of the universe admitting it was designed for this moment.
This exact moment.
Where you're reading this.
Where I'm watching you read this.
Where we both know what happens next.

*

Warren
(who measures time in the intervals between your laughs)
(who is writing the next letter while you read this one)
(who would choose this specific malfunction over any other operating system)
(who knows you're about to look up and smile that smile that reorganizes physics)

P.S. — In every timeline where love exists, this letter finds you. In every timeline where you exist, you say yes. We've tested all the variables. The outcome is constant.

P.P.S. — Your middle name is the password to a future that's already happening. I've been typing it into everything: ATMs, laptops, the morning sky. Sometimes it works.

P.P.P.S. — This letter ends but we don't. We continue in the burnt toast, in the Tuesday mornings, in the specific way silence sounds when we're both in it. We continue whether we mean to or not. We continue because continuation is what love does when it runs out of words.

*

(You're saying yes now. I can hear it in the way you're breathing.)

(Welcome home, my love. Welcome to the beautiful disaster. Welcome to always.)
