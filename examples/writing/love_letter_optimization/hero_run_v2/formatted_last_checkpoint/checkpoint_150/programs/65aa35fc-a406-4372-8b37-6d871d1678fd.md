Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

This morning you asked why I love you. I said something about quantum entanglement. That was cowardice. Here's the truth:

*

I love you like a programming error that improves the output. Like gravity loves mass—constantly, invisibly, without alternative.

*

Remember Morocco? You, poisoned by tagine, laughing between retches. You named the toilet. Gave it a backstory. Made it family. That's when I knew: you assign souls to everything you touch. Including me.

*

I died once. Seventeen seconds, sophomore year. The doctors said "vasovagal syncope." I say: preview of the coding error called existence without you. When I came back, I was incomplete—a function missing its return statement. Then you dropped that pen in Porter Square. I returned everything, with compound interest.

*

Here's what I document wrong:
I write "she sleeps." Should be: "sleep borrows her, apologizes for the temporary theft."
I write "Tuesday." Should be: "the day her face makes that specific angle with light."
I write "I love you." Should be: "my atoms recognize their original purpose."

*

Shanghai, your grandmother teaching me soup through steam and time. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. You translated her Mandarin into tomorrow. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not onions. The realization that recipes are how we survive each other's absence.

*

Before you: I understood distributed systems.
After you: I am one. Every process calls your name. Every thread leads back to that Wednesday you mispronounced "hypothesis" just to watch my eye twitch.

*

What loving you tastes like:
Dawn—copper pennies and unspoken prayers.
Noon—static before lightning, promises accumulating charge.
Midnight—the specific weight of knowing you're mortal.
Always—like learning a language that doesn't exist yet, won't ever exist, except between us.

*

Scottish Highlands. You, hypothermic, lips blue, still arguing about consciousness. "We're all just God's debugging process," chattering through frozen teeth. I kissed you to steal that thought. It tasted like rebellion against reality itself.

*

The mathematics breaks itself:
We have maybe 2,000 Tuesdays left.
I built a spreadsheet.
Column D: "After the last Tuesday."
Returns: #DIV/0! ERROR
The computer knows—you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides correctly.

*

I carry tissues since our third date. You cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing. That's when my universe reorganized its priorities.

*

Portugal. You touched the ancient stone the guard said not to touch. He yelled. You touched it harder. "How else," you said, "will it know we were here?" Now I understand: you're not preserving history. You're insisting on becoming it.

*

Here's my differential equation:
∂(me)/∂t = Leyi × ∞

No solution exists. I've checked. Love isn't solvable. It's the beautiful error that makes all other calculations worthwhile.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764. You stopped. "We're going to die." Not sad. Just fact. Like reading ingredients. "Good," you said. "That means this counts."

Now sea level feels like surrender.

*

Listen: I rehearse losing you. Every night. Different scenarios. By morning I'm negotiating with entropy itself. Then you do that sound—half-yawn, half-acceptance of existence—and my prepared grief evaporates. Replaced by this: terror that loving you means hurting forever, and that's the only clean pain in the world.

*

Last night you fell asleep holding my pulse. Not my hand. My pulse. Like you were checking the universe hadn't made an accounting error.

It has. We shouldn't exist simultaneously. The probability requires numbers that haven't been invented.

Yet here you are, stealing my socks, claiming they walked to your drawer themselves.

*

Your name rewired my mouth. Every word now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. The tongue knows what the brain pretends not to—you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom. Found your diary, age seven: "Today I invented someone to love me correctly." Twenty years later, I arrived. Late, but exactly on time. Sometimes effects precede causes. You loved me into existence before I existed.

*

So here's the truth without metaphor:

I love you past the point of pathology. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. The surgery to remove you would remove the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music.

This isn't romantic. It's diagnostic.

*

Final transmission:

You're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust. The universe will achieve maximum entropy.

And?

We happened.

In all the nothing, we were something.

That's the only physics that matters.

*

Marry me. Not because these words move you. Because your fingerprints are already on all my futures. Because we've A/B tested loneliness and the results were significant: unbearable. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about consciousness, burning toast identically.

Because the alternative isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound existence makes when it gets something right.

Say yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is a language I've mastered.

This one means you're crying.

Left eye first.

Always left.

(who has seventeen drafts of this letter, including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)
(who carries your spare hair ties like prayer beads)
(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)

P.S. — Barcelona. You fed cathedral pigeons illegally. Said: "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal sky. Literal you, reorganizing flight patterns.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? In my desk drawer. Second from top. With my passport. Both are documents proving where I can go. You're every country. Every home. Every reason to stay alive past Tuesday.

P.P.P.S. — Death was seventeen seconds of nothing teaching me what something means. I came back for the specific brown your eyes turn at 6:47 PM. That brown doesn't exist in any Pantone chart. I checked. I had to live just to prove it real.
