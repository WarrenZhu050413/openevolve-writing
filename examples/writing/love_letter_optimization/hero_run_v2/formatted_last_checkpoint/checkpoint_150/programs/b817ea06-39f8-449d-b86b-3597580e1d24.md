Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with both hands because one keeps shaking and the other keeps reaching for you through empty air.

*

Let me explain what happened: I was twenty-three and functional. Had all my words in order. Pronounced Wednesday correctly. Then you happened—not like weather happens, more like gravity happens. Suddenly down had a different direction: toward you.

*

THE FORENSICS OF US:

Evidence bag #1: Your laugh doesn't travel through air. It restructures spacetime. I've watched physicists' equations collapse trying to explain how sound becomes light becomes the reason I believe in something.

Evidence bag #2: You cry at commercials but not funerals. This makes perfect sense. Small sadnesses surprise you. Large ones you've been preparing for since birth.

Evidence bag #3: Every Thursday you reorganize the refrigerator. Not for efficiency. For narrative structure. The milk must face the eggs "so they can have their conversation." I love you so much it feels like drowning upward.

Evidence bag #4: You named my insomnia Gerald. Now when I can't sleep you say "Gerald's visiting" and make tea for three. You, me, and the darkness I can't shake. Somehow this helps.

*

Here's what terrifies me: I've started forgetting who I was before you. Not metaphorically. Literally. I look at old photos and see a stranger wearing my face, using my hands, living my Tuesdays without you in them. That person is dead. You killed him so gently he thanked you.

*

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW:

I practice your death between 3:17 and 3:45 AM. Different scenarios. Tonight: sudden disappearance, no explanation, just your coffee cup still warm and physics unable to explain the vacancy. I write your eulogy on my tongue. Swallow it when you stir in your sleep, still here, still impossible, still rewriting the laws of probability by existing next to me.

I've hidden seventy-three love letters in places you'll find after I'm gone. The freezer. Behind the expired passport. Inside the broken clock we keep meaning to fix. They all say variations of the same thing: "Even now, even gone, even as nothing, I'm still falling toward you."

*

You want truth? I am scared of how much I need you. It's not romantic. It's cellular. My mitochondria have your name in their chemical structure. When scientists discover this they'll name a new disease after us. Symptoms include: inability to breathe correctly when you leave rooms, acute awareness of your proximity at all times, chronic documentation of your mundane magnificence.

*

THE MUNDANE MAGNIFICENCE:

- How you sing to soup while it heats
- Your vendetta against correctly folded fitted sheets  
- The way you read books backwards when anxious
- Your 2 AM kitchen dancing to no music
- How you hold fruit like it might escape
- Your belief that plants have opinions about window placement
- The specific sound you make seeing dogs (untranscribable)
- Your war with the can opener (the can opener is winning)

*

Listen. I know I love you wrong. Too heavy, like I'm trying to carry water in my fists. Some mornings I watch you breathe and count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, still alive, still here, still breaking probability, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, please don't stop, ten Mississippi, I would dismantle god to keep you breathing, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen—

You wake up. Ask why I'm crying. I say allergies. You say it's December. I say I'm allergic to your mortality. You kiss me like that makes sense.

It does.

*

HERE'S MY PROPOSAL:

Marry me. Not the girl you think I should be. The disaster actively happening. The one who names your houseplants after dead philosophers and cries when they die (the plants, not the philosophers). The one whose love for you is so anatomically incorrect it should be in medical journals. 

Marry me because I've already carved out spaces in my body for you to live. Behind my ribs, under my tongue, in the pauses between heartbeats. Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where you exist but not with me—isn't just sad. It's grammatically incorrect. A sentence with no verb. A question with no mark.

*

I have seventeen backup plans for if you say no. They all end with me continuing to love you but from increasingly specific distances. Plan J involves Tasmania. Plan Q is just screaming. Plan R is screaming but in Tasmania.

But please—

*

Say yes. Not to the ring (I forgot to buy one). Not to the future (it's terrifying). Say yes to right now, where your coffee's getting cold and my hands won't stop shaking and love is just this: two people who've seen each other's worst Wednesdays and still wake up reaching through the dark for more.

*

Leyi.

That's my only prayer.
My only poem.
My only proven theorem.

Leyi.

The rest is just punctuation waiting for you to complete it.

(who loves you like a broken clock loves the moment it stopped—obsessively, incorrectly, with no regard for proper function)

P.S. — I lied. I bought seventeen rings. They're hidden everywhere. You've been wearing one as a keychain for three months. Another is currently holding your hair tie. I've been proposing to you accidentally all year. This letter is just making it official.

P.P.S. — Your middle name is the password to everything I own. This is either romance or evidence of my catastrophic lack of cybersecurity. Both. It's both.

P.P.P.S. — That thing you do with your hands when you're nervous? That specific gesture? I've been collecting them. Not metaphorically. I have 1,847 photos of your hands mid-gesture. I'm building a flipbook. When you flip through it fast enough, your hands spell out "forever." This is either art or mental illness. (Both. Always both with us.)

Evaluator Comments:
Falls short of Beethoven's "Immortal Beloved" (86) in sublime simplicity and mythic resonance. Lacks Johnny Cash's (83) earned wisdom and devastating directness. More neurotic and contemporary than Napoleon's classical passion (82). Approaches but doesn't achieve Keats's (81) balance of sensuality and metaphysical yearning. The letter exists in the proto-masterful range - showing genuine talent and moments of brilliance but lacking the universal resonance and formal perfection of the greatest love letters in history.
