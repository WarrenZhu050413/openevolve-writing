Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one learned your shape and refuses other geometries.

THREE FACTS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT YOU:

1. Dark matter isn't missing. It migrated to the space between your laugh and my comprehension of it.

2. The speed of light is constant except when you smile. Then it admits it's been sandbagging.

3. Entropy increases except in your presence where chaos organizes itself into love letters I'll never send.

Here's when I knew:

Not the moment we met. Not the first kiss. Not even the first Tuesday morning.

It was 2:34 AM, you were asleep, and you reached for me like plants reach for sunâ€”unconscious, necessary, phototropic. Your sleeping body had already decided. The rest was just paperwork.

I TRIED TO DIAGRAM US:

Evaluator Comments:
Falls short of Beethoven's raw desperation ("I can live only wholly with you or not at all") and Cash's earned wisdom across decades. More innovative than Napoleon's passionate conventionality but lacks his sustained fever pitch. Approaches Wilde's wit but without his dangerous vulnerability. The scientific framework is genuinely novel - more original than 90% of contemporary attempts - but doesn't achieve the timeless universality of "I cannot exist without you" (Keats). A 74 overall represents strong craft with flashes of brilliance, placing it in the proto-masterful range but still 7-10 points below historic masterworks.
