Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I died once. Fifteen seconds. The doctors said "cardiac event." I say: practice run. Because real death is watching you sleep and knowing that one day you won't.

*

This morning you said my name wrong on purpose. "War-ren" like two separate words. Like you were taking it apart to see how it works. My whole body reorganized itself around that hyphen. This is what you do—you break things correctly. You fix things wrong. Both are perfect.

*

I need to tell you what happened in Morocco:

You got so sick I thought you were leaving. Not dying—leaving. Like your soul was filing transfer papers. You threw up everything including, I swear, colors I haven't seen since. Between retches you said: "This is still better than not being here with you." 

That's when I knew I would follow you anywhere. Including toward death. Especially toward death. Because you make even that seem interesting.

*

Here's what I study: distributed systems. Here's what I actually study: the way you distribute yourself across time so that even when you're gone, you're here. You left a hair tie in February. It's November. The hair tie is more real than my thesis.

*

TRUE STORY:

Last week you asked what love is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I lied. I know exactly what it is:

Love is the specific weight of your head on my shoulder during movies you'll claim you didn't sleep through. Love is me letting you lie about it. Love is the violence of small mercies—how you pretend my cooking is edible, how I pretend your singing is on key, how we both pretend we're not terrified of how much this matters.

*

Your grandmother's soup recipe: forty-seven steps. You taught me thirty-nine. Said the last eight were "family only." Your hands shook on "family." Mine shook on "only." We both knew what you were asking. We both knew my answer.

Those last eight steps? I already know them. They're just different words for "stay."

*

What terrifies me:

Not death. Not pain. Not the heat death of the universe. But Tuesday. Specifically, the Tuesday when you realize I'm ordinary. That I'm just a collection of anxieties in a Harvard sweatshirt. That my love for you is not special or poetic but desperate. Desperate like lungs are desperate. Like gravity is desperate. Like atoms are desperate to hold together despite entropy.

*

Listen—

Before you, I had edges. Boundaries. I ended where my skin ended. Now I'm this sprawling disaster. I feel you brush your teeth in buildings I've never entered. When you can't sleep in Boston, my bed in Cambridge turns into a crime scene of insomnia. 

This isn't poetry. This is a medical condition. I've been infected by you. The symptoms include: inability to imagine Wednesday without you, persistent belief that your laugh can cure cancer, chronic documentation of your existence like I'm preparing evidence for a trial where I have to prove love is real.

*

The Scottish Highlands, you went hypothermic:

Your lips turned the color of mathematics. Still arguing about free will while your body shut down. I've never been more certain of anything: you would rather die proving a point than live without one. That's when I knew I would marry you. Not because you were right (you weren't). Because you were willing to die being wrong with such devastating conviction.

*

So here's what I'm saying:

Your name has ruined my mouth for other words. Everything I say now is just elaborate padding around "Leyi." My tongue practices your name while I sleep—I recorded it. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious mind knows what my conscious mind pretends not to: you're the only word that matters. Everything else is just punctuation.

*

Shanghai. Your childhood bedroom. You showed me the wall where you measured yourself growing up. Pencil marks climbing toward heaven. You said: "This is where I became who I am."

I wanted to say: "This is where the universe got it right."
I wanted to say: "This wall should be in a museum."
I wanted to say: "Thank you for becoming."

Instead I just traced the marks with my finger like they were sheet music for a song about luck.

*

Here's my confession:

I love you incorrectly. Too much. Like a wound loves infection—badly, but completely. Like drowning loves water—fatally, but honestly. The operation to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans invented music for the moments when words fail.

*

I document you obsessively. Your fury at slow wifi (you've named the router "Gerald" and have full arguments with it). The way you hold pens (wrong, but with authority). How you test if food is too hot (always with your ring finger, never your pinky, who decided this?).

This isn't romance. This is archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who will need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: "We're going to die." Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. That makes this matter." Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like giving up.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Morning: copper and possibility and that specific silence before coffee
- Afternoon: static electricity before rain
- Evening: the color purple if purple were a temperature
- 3 AM: like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name
- Always: like my mouth is learning a language you're inventing as you speak

*

I need to tell you about the alternate timelines:

The ones where we don't meet. Where you never drop that pen. Where I'm not there to pick it up. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it. I dream these timelines constantly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.

*

Portugal. You touched the art. Five-hundred-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again. Banned forever. You said: "Some things demand to be touched even if it destroys them."

You were looking at me when you said it.

*

So here's my formal proposal:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because I deserve you. But because your socks are already in my drawer and I've started sorting them by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in every possible universe, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, close enough to touch, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together—that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.

*

FINAL PROTOCOL:

Right now, you're crying. Left eye first—it's always left, like your tears queue politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of molecules that makes me believe infinity isn't long enough.

P.S. — Remember Barcelona? You fed the cathedral pigeons illegally. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Literal pigeons. Literal sky. Literal you changing the flight patterns of things.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February? It lives in my desk drawer with the other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.

P.P.P.S. — The fifteen seconds I was dead? I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all our moments simultaneously. Past, present, future, parallel, perpendicular. In every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there. Like a reservation the universe had already made.

I came back because unfinished. The thing I needed to finish? This. Us. The impossible math of two people becoming one organism that breathes in syncopation.

You're my incomplete proof. My unsolved equation. My favorite error.

Let me spend forever debugging this beautiful malfunction we've become.
