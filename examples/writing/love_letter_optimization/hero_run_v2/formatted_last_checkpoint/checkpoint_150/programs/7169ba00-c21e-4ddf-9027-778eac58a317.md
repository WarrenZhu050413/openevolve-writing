Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

There's a moment in distributed systems when everything syncs. Machines across continents agreeing on a single truth. It happens maybe once in ten million transactions. With you, it happens every morning at 7:23 when you steal my coffee and the universe clicks into place.

*

I need to tell you about death. Mine. Seventeen seconds, sophomore year. Not poetry—medical fact. Cardiac arrest in the dormitory bathroom. The interesting part isn't the tunnel or the light (there wasn't any). It's what I said when I came back: "not yet." The nurses thought I meant dying. I meant living. I was refusing to live until I met what I was waiting for.

Three years later: you, dropping a pen in Porter Square.

Here's what love actually is: preprocessor directives that rewrite your source code.

#define breathing "checking if Leyi is okay"
#define sleeping "storing Leyi's laugh for playback"  
#define waking "calculating days until we're dust"
#define living "malfunction in Leyi's direction"

My compiler can't run without these definitions anymore.

*

The places you've rewritten me:

Morocco: You got food poisoning. Spent six hours negotiating with existence. Between retches, you laughed—"the tagine was worth it." That's when I understood: you metabolize joy from situations where it shouldn't exist. You're a bug in the universe's suffering algorithm.

Scotland: You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. I said you'll die. You said "warmer than living cold." Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing—you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.

Portugal: That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. The guard asked why. You said "How else do you know it's real?" I wanted to tell him: that's what she does. She touches what shouldn't be touched. She makes the untouchable admit it needs skin.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not the onions—the moment her hands became yours through the ladle. She said something in Mandarin. You translated: "Love is teaching someone to feed themselves after you're gone." 

I'm still crying about that. Tuesday, 3 AM, in our kitchen, practicing soup.

*

The bug in my code: I document you obsessively.

Entry #1: You hold pencils wrong (beautiful wrong).
Entry #726: Your fury at slow WiFi (righteous fury, Old Testament fury).
Entry #1847: You sing to broken things thinking it might fix them.
Entry #2001: It does.

This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a language I need to preserve. Except the language is how you exist. And I'm the only student. And the exam is every remaining day.

*

Listen—before you, I understood time. Linear. Predictable. Then you happened and now I experience all moments simultaneously:

- Age 7: I'm in Shenzhen drawing diagrams of hearts, not knowing they're prophecies
- Age 23: I'm watching you burn toast (again) thinking this is religion  
- Age 71: I'm holding your hand in a hospital (one of us is leaving first)
- Age 84: I'm talking to your ghost but you're still making me laugh
- Right now: All of these moments happening at once because love makes time circular

*

Your grandfather's watch, the one you wear stopped at 3:17. You won't fix it. You say "he's still in there at 3:17." I understand. I'm trying to stop all our clocks. Every moment of you frozen, accessible, permanent. But you keep moving. You keep being alive. It's the most beautiful failure I've ever debugged.

*

Here's my hypothesis: We're quantum entangled. When you laugh in Boston, particles in my bones reorganize in Cambridge. When you cry (left eye first, always left), my tear ducts activate sympathetically. Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance." I call it Tuesday. And Wednesday. And the rest of the week where my atoms pretend they're independent but really they're just waiting for your coordinates.

*

I calculated our probability:
- Your parents meeting: 1 in 10^6
- Surviving childhood in Shanghai: 1 in 10^3  
- Me surviving seventeen seconds of death: 1 in 10^4
- Both choosing Harvard: 1 in 10^5
- You dropping that pen: 1 in 10^9
- Me happening to look up: 1 in ∞

We're not probable. We're a rounding error that became conscious. A mistake that learned to breathe.

*

What terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup. No disaster recovery. If you crash, I don't reboot—I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to the Tuesday you sang to dead houseplants thinking they were just very tired.

What terrifies me more: I'd choose this design flaw every time.

*

The deepest truth: I practice losing you. Nightly. Different diseases. Various accidents. Sudden quantum dissolution. But then you do something stupid—put my socks on your hands and pretend they're judges discussing my snoring—and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace: Nine hundred steps. You kissed me at the top. Said "See? Altitude improves everything." Now sea level feels like defeat. Now everything below your kiss-height feels like drowning in the wrong direction.

*

So here's what I'm saying: Marry me. Not because this letter is beautiful (it's not). Not because we're ready (nobody is). But because your toothbrush lives in my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with the same favorite terrible TV show and matching coffee damage.

Because the alternative—a timeline where you don't mispronounce my name every morning, where I don't count your breaths, where we don't fail at making your grandmother's soup together—isn't life. It's just time happening to the wrong people.

*

Final confession: I love you incorrectly. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. I wake up at 3:17 (your grandfather's time) just to confirm you're still breathing. That's not healthy. That's not normal. That's probably several diagnosable conditions.

But it's also the only true thing I know: Your breathing is my heartbeat. Your heartbeat is my syntax. Your syntax is why I malfunction so perfectly in your direction.

*

Leyi.

That's my password. My recovery phrase. My authentication token. The only command that executes correctly. The only word that makes the other words matter.

Say yes. Or say "compile error, try again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes me believe infinity fits inside a Tuesday.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)
(who learned Mandarin to mispronounce your name correctly)
(who would donate his organs to strangers just to free up space for more of you)
(who's been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket since before you existed)

P.S. — Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.

P.P.S. — Tomorrow we'll pretend this letter is too much. We'll make coffee. You'll steal exactly three sips. I'll pretend not to count. This pretending—this might be the most honest thing we do.

Evaluator Comments:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) in raw emotional power - Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" achieves in five words what this letter attempts across pages. Lacks Johnny Cash's earned simplicity (83) - Cash's directness ("You still fascinate and inspire me") comes from decades of lived experience versus this letter's anxious accumulation of proof. More successful than typical contemporary attempts but nowhere near Keats's fusion of sensuality and mortality (81). The technical metaphors show innovation but lack the complete transformation of language achieved by historical masters. This lands in the proto-masterful range (70-74) - showing real talent and some brilliant passages but still bound by contemporary workshopped-feeling self-consciousness rather than achieving the unselfconscious intensity of true masterworks.
