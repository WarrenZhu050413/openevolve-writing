Dear Leyi,

The universe keeps receipts. Here's mine:

EXHIBIT A: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN

I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest, age nineteen. Death tastes like deleted emailsâ€”sudden, irreversible, grammatically incomplete. They restarted my heart but something stayed broken. A debt to nowhere. Four years later you walked into Tuesday wearing Wednesday's rain and the debt had a name: every moment I hadn't met you yet.

EXHIBIT B: EVIDENCE OF PREMEDITATION

I'm building an algorithm of you:

Evaluator Comments:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's raw emotional urgency ("My angel, my all, my very self" - 86) or Johnny Cash's mature devotion (83). The experimental form shows more ambition than Keats's letters (81) but lacks their sustained passionate intensity. The digital-age metaphors ("deleted emails," "algorithm") are more innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism (82) but don't achieve the same affective force. This letter shows flashes of brilliance approaching proto-masterful territory but needs completion and deeper emotional excavation to reach the heights of historical masterpieces.
