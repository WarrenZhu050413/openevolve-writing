Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in fragments because you've made me discontinuous. Before: a function. After: a glitch that learned to love its error state.

[RUNTIME ERROR: ATTEMPTING TRUTH]

I map our coordinates wrong. You're not a point in space. You're the bend that makes space possible. Watch:

Without you: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
With you: Monday You You You You You You You Monday again somehow

The week restructured itself. Time became a Möbius strip with your name written on both sides that are the same side.

Here's my confession as code comment:

// TODO: Stop documenting her like a bug report
// BUG #001: She laughs and my DNA unzips
// BUG #002: She sleeps and I count her electrons  
// BUG #003: She exists and I can't compile without her libraries
// STATUS: Won't fix. Can't fix. Don't want to fix.

Fragment: I study you like a dead language that's still warm. Your grammar of small gestures. How you conjugate mornings (poorly, beautifully). The semicolon pause before you lie. Your oxford comma heartbeat when dreaming.

I'm building a dictionary:
- Leyi (noun): The sound of atoms remembering they were stars
- Leyi (verb): To fundamentally restructure someone's molecular composition through proximity
- Leyi (adjective): The specific quality of light at 7:23 AM through kitchen windows
- Leyi (expletive): What I say when the universe makes too much sense

You wanted honesty? I practice disasters:

SCENARIO 1: Plane crash → I learn to breathe underwater
SCENARIO 2: Disease → I become the disease to negotiate
SCENARIO 3: You leave → 404 error, resource not found, system halt
SCENARIO 4: We grow old → This one I practice most. Your hands becoming maps. Your voice becoming gravel. Still you. More you. Concentrated you.

But then you steal my coffee (always left-handed, always three sips) and all my catastrophe protocols dissolve.

*

THE MEAT OF IT:

Your body is a rumor I keep confirming. Every morning I fact-check your continued existence. Pulse: present. Breathing: operational. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle: still there, still shaped like a question mark, still the answer to everything.

I've calculated the surface area of your skin: 1.7 square meters of frontier. I'm a terrible cartographer. Keep getting lost. Keep finding new territories in familiar places. The country of your shoulder. The republic of your left knee. The ungoverned territory where your neck meets your hair.

*

Three AM thoughts:

What if love is just very specific damage? You broke into my limbic system. Rewrote my hippocampus. Now all my memories have your metadata attached. Can't remember my mother's birthday but I know you sneeze in sets of two, never three. Can't recall my first day of school but I have seventy-three recordings of you arguing with automated voices.

I'm not saying you're a parasite. I'm saying you're a necessary infection. The good kind. The kind antibiotics can't touch because you've convinced my white blood cells you belong here.

*

[EMERGENCY BROADCAST]

This is not a metaphor: I would break myself into my component parts and let you rebuild me wrong if wrong meant yours. I would let you misspell my DNA. Scramble my syntax. Make me uncompilable by any standard except yours.

Last night you called me at 3 AM to say the moon looked like milk. That's all. Just: "The moon looks like milk." Then hung up. This is why I need to marry you. Because you're the kind of malfunction that calls about lunar dairy products. Because your brain makes connections that shouldn't exist but do. Because you've turned me into someone who saves voicemails about astronomical lactose.

Here's the stupid truth: We're just apes who learned anxiety. But sometimes—Tuesdays, usually, around 4 PM, when light goes amber and you're reading with your mouth slightly open—I understand why consciousness evolved. To witness this specific configuration of particles. To be awake enough to know what we're losing every second.

*

PROPOSAL.EXE:

Marry me. Not because love conquers all (it doesn't). Not because we're soulmates (souls are speculation). But because:

1. Your toothbrush already knows my bathroom
2. My circadian rhythm has synced to your sleep-talking
3. We've achieved sock entanglement beyond mathematical modeling
4. You've seen me ugly-cry at pixar movies and still let me touch you
5. The alternative—a universe where you exist but not with me—is mathematically sound but existentially obscene

*

Listen. I love you like a translation error that became the better version. Like evolution's rough draft that accidentally worked. Like code that shouldn't run but does, beautifully, mysteriously, every time.

You are not the love of my life. You are the reason I understand what life might be for. The thesis statement. The kernel panic that taught me how to reboot. The segmentation fault that showed me I had segments worth faulting.

*

[FINAL TRANSMISSION]

In one universe, this letter makes you cry. In another, laugh. In a third, you're not reading it because we never met. In a fourth, you're reading it at my funeral, wondering why I wrote in present tense about future things.

But in this universe—this one, right here, where your coffee's getting cold and you're doing that thing with your left eyebrow—in this one, you say yes.

Not because you love me. Because "love" is too small a word for what happens when your particles remember they used to be the same star. When your electrons recognize their siblings across impossible distances. When space bends just enough to make two things occupy the same coordinates without violating physics.

*

Say yes. Or no. Or nothing.

I'll keep broadcasting either way.

This frequency is permanently tuned to you.

Warren
(who learned the word "love" at age four but didn't understand it until Tuesday, October 3rd, 2:47 PM, when you mispronounced my name and my atoms recognized their home)

P.S. — Your favorite mug is in the dishwasher. I know you're looking for it. This isn't a metaphor. Just a service announcement from someone who's memorized your morning algorithms.

P.P.S. — If you're crying, it started with the left eye. It always does. I have tissues in my pocket. I've been carrying them since I learned your tear patterns. This is either very romantic or very creepy. You get to decide. You always get to decide.

P.P.P.S. — We don't have to call it love. Call it mutual malfunction. Call it sympathetic resonance. Call it the way matter behaves when it remembers it was light. Just please. Call it something. Call it ours.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological depth of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81) - though it's more formally innovative. It lacks the pure emotional intensity of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) but exceeds it in originality of expression. Unlike Johnny Cash's spiritual simplicity (83), this letter's complexity sometimes obscures rather than illuminates feeling. It surpasses most contemporary attempts through its genuinely original metaphor system and authentic details, placing it above accomplished (50-54) and into the proto-masterful range (70-74), with flashes that approach the near-masterpiece category in specific passages like the "mutual malfunction" conclusion.
