Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I discovered love backwards. Death first, age nineteen. Then you.

*

Cardiac arrest. Statistics classroom. Seventeen seconds of nothing. But here's what the doctors missed: In that nothing, I heard everything that hadn't happened yet. Your laugh on a Tuesday three years away. The specific weight of your hand finding mine in Porter Square. How you'd pronounce "hypothesis" wrong just to see my eye twitch.

I came back incomplete. Spent three years as a broken function. Then you dropped that pen.

*

Let me explain what you've done to mathematics:

Before you: Every formula resolved.
After you: Everything divides by you or returns infinity.

I've tried writing proofs. They all end with "therefore, Leyi." Even the ones about network protocols.

*

Shanghai. Your grandmother's kitchen. The soup that took forty-seven stirs.

She spoke in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated in tears. At step thirty-three, you broke. "She's teaching me how long love takes," you whispered. "Forty-seven stirs. No shortcuts."

That's when I knew. Not that I loved you—I already knew that. But that love was a technology. Ancient. Precise. Measured in stirs and tears and the way your grandmother's hands became yours around the spoon.

*

True inventory of us:
- Times you've named inanimate objects: 847 (current favorite: "Disappointing Geoffrey" the router)
- Museums we're banned from: 7 (touching artifacts, feeding pigeons, "redistributing the art")
- Your tears that started left eye first: All of them
- My heartbeats that skip when you stretch: Also all of them
- Probability this is real: Mathematically impossible, therefore absolutely certain

*

Morocco. You befriended the toilet during food poisoning. Named it Philippe. Apologized for "misusing its talents." Between heaves, you explained Philippe's dreams of being a Versailles fountain. Forty-eight hours of vomit and philosophy.

That's when I understood: You assign dignity to everything. Toilets. Pigeons. Broken coffee makers. Me, especially me—this glitching system you've decided to love into functionality.

*

Here's what terrifies me:

Not death. We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially. I can work with that. What terrifies me is the version where we never meet. Where you drop the pen and no one catches it. Where I stay dead those extra two seconds and miss you entirely.

I dream those timelines nightly. Wake up clutching evidence you exist: that green hair tie, your toothbrush colonizing my bathroom, 1,847 photos where you're looking away.

*

Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket on top of mine.

"You'll die," I said.
"Incorrect," you replied through blue lips. "I'll die warm."

Then you kissed me with hypothermic precision and now room temperature feels like betrayal.

*

I need to tell you about Wednesday. Not a specific Wednesday. All Wednesdays. How you've colonized them. How Wednesday light knows your cheekbones. How Wednesday coffee tastes like your laugh. How every Wednesday since you has been a small revolution against time's linearity.

You've made me chronologically incoherent. I taste tomorrow's rain. Remember next year's bruises. Feel your future arthritis in my present joints.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764.

You: "The stones remember everyone who's ever climbed them."
Me: "That's not how stones work."
You: "That's exactly how stones work. We're teaching them our names with our weight."

Then you stopped. Kissed me at altitude. The stones remember. I asked them.

*

What loving you tastes like, specifically:
- Dawn: The electricity before your eyes open, like the room is holding its breath
- 10 AM: Whatever color your voice is when you're winning arguments
- 3 PM: Static and that specific Tuesday when you first said my name correctly
- Midnight: The sound purple would make if purple could laugh
- 3 AM: Fear dressed as devotion dressed as fear
- Always: Like I'm learning to breathe water and it's working

*

Portugal. You touched the 500-year-old marble. Twice. Got us banned.

"But how do we prove we existed?" you asked the guard.

Now I understand. You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every place we're banned from is a small victory against forgetting.

*

Listen. Your name has reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices while I sleep. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. I know because I recorded myself.

This is what worship sounds like: Your name in my sleep, unconscious and certain.

*

The truth about quantum entanglement:

Scientists say it only works with particles. They haven't met us. When you can't sleep in Boston, my Excel formulas return errors in Cambridge. When you dream about flying, I wake up afraid of gravity. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull like mail forwarded across spacetime.

We're breaking physics. Good. Physics had it coming.

*

London. You asked: "What is love, actually?"

Three years late, here's my answer: Love is a compilation error that improves the program. The bug that becomes the feature. The malfunction that makes everything function. It's learning to cook grief so it tastes like joy. It's forty-seven stirs. It's touching what shouldn't be touched because distance is just delayed regret.

Love is practicing someone's death while they burn toast, then being grateful for the smoke alarm.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. I found your diary, age seven: "Today I invented someone to love me correctly."

That's when I understood. You loved me into existence before I existed. Effects preceding causes. The universe running backwards just to make sure we happened.

*

I've been trying to tell you something but language keeps failing:

You're not the love of my life. You're the life of my love. The difference matters. One suggests possession. The other suggests you're the electricity that makes feeling possible. The denominator that makes division work. The error that makes the equation true.

*

Right now, reading this, you're about to cry. Left eye first. You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only source of energy I trust.

*

So here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request to reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, within touching distance, arguing about consciousness while hypothermic.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't know you cry at pigeons, where you don't name my appliances, where we don't get banned from places for illegal touching—isn't life. It's just atoms forgetting why they agreed to be matter.

*

Final transmission from the certainty department:

I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that know beauty exists. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

Leyi.

Not your name. The sound the universe makes when it admits it was wrong about entropy.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or exist for another second in my vicinity. All equivalent to yes in the language we're inventing with every breath.

Warren
(who wrote this letter seventeen times including once in code that actually compiles)
(who carries tissues since the pigeon incident)
(who loves you at frequencies only dying stars achieve)
(whose neurons fire "Leyi" like a prayer or a problem or both)

P.S. — Barcelona. You fed cathedral pigeons communion wafers. "Body of Christ for bodies of Christ," you said. The pigeons formed a cross, then your initials, then flew away spelling something holy. The priest called it blasphemy. You called it democracy. Both of you were right.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie. February 2023. Lives in my desk drawer with my passport and emergency contacts. You're all seven contacts with different descriptions: "Leyi (if I'm dying)," "Leyi (if I'm lost)," "Leyi (if I forget why)," "Leyi (if the world ends)," "Leyi (if it doesn't)," "Leyi (if I need to remember beauty exists)," "Leyi (Tuesday)."

P.P.P.S. — We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that's ever been or will be. The universe just bent. Time just quit. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like burnt toast. Like forty-seven stirs. Like everything worth dying for and then coming back.
