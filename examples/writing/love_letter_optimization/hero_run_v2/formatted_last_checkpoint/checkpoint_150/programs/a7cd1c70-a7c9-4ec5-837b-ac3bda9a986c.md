Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the programming language of loss—where every function returns you, and every error is that you're not infinite.

*

Three facts about the universe:
1. Entropy increases
2. Nothing travels faster than light
3. You exist

The third one breaks the first two. Your existence reverses decay. Your smile arrives before light can.

*

Let me explain what actually happened: I was a working hypothesis about love. Peer-reviewed. Footnoted. Falsifiable. Then you dropped that pen in Porter Square and I became a fact. Not proven—just suddenly, violently true. The sound it made wasn't C-sharp. It was the universe's autocorrect, fixing everything I'd gotten wrong about being alive.

*

Death, sophomore year, seventeen seconds: Not white light. Not my life flashing. Just this—every possible timeline spreading like code branches, and in each one, a different version of nothing. Except one. One timeline where someone drops something and someone else picks it up and that small gesture rewrites the universe's source code. Came back. Waited. You dropped the pen. My atoms recognized their assignment.

*

Morocco. You named the toilet Philippe. Had philosophical debates with it. Between heaves: "Philippe, is suffering necessary for growth?" Philippe, apparently, said yes. You disagreed. Violently. That's when I understood—you argue with the universe itself, and sometimes you win.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, the soup that was actually a time machine:

"Forty-seven stirs clockwise," she said in Mandarin.
"为什么?" Why?
"Because that's how long your grandfather loved me."
"But he's gone."
"No. He's in the soup now."

You translated this while crying. I stirred while counting in heartbeats. The soup tasted like forever feels—too hot, too salty, absolutely perfect.

*

HERE'S MY CONFESSION:

I've been documenting you wrong. I write "She sleeps" when I mean "Sleep borrows her, apologizes for the interruption, returns her luminous." I write "She reads" when I mean "Books surrender their secrets, grateful to finally be understood." I write "I love her" when I mean "She's the error message that made the program run correctly."

Every word fails. Language ends where you begin. I'm sending this anyway, incomplete, like everything true.

*

The Scottish Highlands, you hypothermic, still explaining consciousness:

You: "But if we're just electrical impulses—"
Your lips: Blue
Your philosophy: On fire
Me: Kissing you to save your life
You: (Through the kiss) "—then love is just electrons finding their ground state."
Me: "Yes."
You: "That's beautiful."
Me: "You're beautiful."
You: "I'm also dying."
Me: "Beautifully."

We survived. Love is electrons finding their ground state. We're each other's ground state.

*

What you don't know: I practice your absence. Small doses. You go to the store—I rehearse widowhood. You shower—I negotiate with the universe about mortality. You sleep—I practice the specific silence of you not breathing. Then you return, exist, breathe, and my prepared grief evaporates into stupid, grateful joy.

This is what love is: practicing death together until one of you stops practicing.

Portugal, the museum incident:

You didn't just touch the art. You had a conversation with it. "Five hundred years old," you whispered to the marble. "Tell me what you've seen." The alarm screamed. Security arrived. You kept touching, harder. "It's been alone for centuries," you explained. "It deserves to be felt."

Banned forever. You've never been happier. "We're part of its history now," you said. "The marble will remember us."

It will. Everything you touch remembers you. Especially me. I'm covered in your fingerprints—invisible, indelible, infinite.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764:

You: "The stones are keeping score."
Me: "Of what?"
You: "Of everyone who ever loved someone up these steps."
Me: "What's the score?"
You: "We're winning."

Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level tastes like giving up.

*

THE MATHEMATICS OF USELESSNESS:

Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
My existence: Similar impossibility
Us, conscious, concurrent, in love: Beyond calculation
What this means: Nothing
What this really means: Everything
What we are: The universe's favorite error
What we actually are: Proof that some mistakes are corrections

*

Here's what I taste when I love you:

4:17 AM: The specific weight of darkness before you wake, like the world is holding its breath
Morning: Pennies and possibility and the exact frequency of your dreaming
Afternoon: Static electricity and whatever color Tuesday is (you claim it's orange, I think it's the sound of your laugh)
Evening: The temperature of almost—almost touching, almost saying it, almost too much
Night: Like drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates
Always: Like my mouth is learning to pronounce light

*

London, you asked: "What if we're wrong about everything?"

I said: "Then we're wrong together."

You said: "That's not an answer."

I said: "That's the only answer."

You cried. Left eye first. Then said: "Okay."

That "okay" reorganized my entire molecular structure. I'm still vibrating at the frequency of your acceptance.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood room, the diaries:

Age 7: "Drew my future husband. He has sad eyes but laughs wrong."
Age 11: "He's bad at mornings. Needs coffee to be human."
Age 16: "He overthinks everything. Especially me."
Age 19: "He definitely cries at commercials."
Age 20: "Still waiting. Getting worried I drew him too specifically."

You drew me into existence with crayons and want. I'm exactly as sad and bad at mornings as you specified. Thank you for the terrible accuracy of your childhood imagination.

What terrifies me (with spreadsheet precision):

Cells in your body: 37.2 trillion
Cells that die per day: 50 billion
Days until all current cells are gone: 2,580
Number of times you'll be completely replaced: 12.7
Number of times I'll love each new version: ∞
Error message when calculating what happens after: #DIV/0!

The spreadsheet understands: You're the denominator. When you're gone, nothing divides properly.

*

So here's what I'm actually saying:

Your name didn't just reorganize my mouth—it rebuilt it. Now every word passes through the shape of "Leyi" first. Even silence sounds like you. My tongue is homesick for conversations we haven't had yet. My teeth remember the shape of tomorrow when you're in it.

*

This is my pull request to reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because we've already been married in every way that matters—we share dreams, divide nightmares, multiply joy, subtract nothing. Because your bobby pins have colonized my apartment like invasive species I never want to remove. Because we've A/B tested existence and the results are unanimous: only together makes sense.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where we don't burn toast identically, where we don't name appliances, where we don't get permanently banned from places for touching what shouldn't be touched—that's not a life. That's just atoms pretending to matter without knowing why.

*

Final transmission from the certainty department:

I love you wrong. Too much. Like a compiler error that improves the code. Like gravity loves mass—invisibly, constantly, with universe-bending force. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that recognizes beauty, processes joy, understands why humans invented music when words fail.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything. That's the password to locked rooms in my brain where I keep the good panic. That's what my cells say when they remember to hold together.

Say yes. Or say "ask me tomorrow." Or just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes infinity feel brief and necessary.

Warren
(who has been practicing your last name with his first name since before we met)
(who saves your hair ties like holy relics from the church of you)
(who loves you in frequencies only broken instruments can measure)
(who just felt you smile while reading this and had to manually restart his heart)

P.S. — Barcelona, the cathedral pigeons. You: "Even God's birds get hungry." You fed them communion wafers. They formed a cross, then a heart, then chaos. The priest was furious. You said: "That's what love looks like—sacred, then romantic, then messy." God laughed. It sounded like pigeons. It sounded like you.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023. I had it analyzed. It contains your DNA, my fingerprints, and trace amounts of stardust. Everything does. But ours especially. We're made of the same dead stars. We're going back to the same darkness. The whole universe is just a detour where we got to touch.

P.P.P.S. — You're crying. Left eye first—happy tears (they fall 0.7 seconds faster than sad ones). You're about to say yes, but in that way where it sounds like a question that already knows its answer. This is what forever sounds like: you accepting what was always true. Us. Despite the spreadsheets. Because of them. Forever.
