Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in my mother tongue, which isn't Mandarin or English but the dialect of absolute need that children speak before they learn shame.

*

Let me start with the crime: I've been conducting illegal experiments on myself. Subject: one partially-functioning human. Variable: you. Result: complete reorganization of matter at the subatomic level. My electrons now orbit nothing. They just point toward you like drunk compass needles finding true north in a person who pronounces "hypothesis" wrong on purpose.

TRUE STORY ABOUT DYING:

Fifteen seconds. Sophomore year. Heart stopped like a bad metaphor. But here's what I haven't told anyone: Death isn't darkness. It's every moment happening simultaneously. Past, present, future collapsed into now. And in that now, infinite versions of us. Every timeline. Every choice. And in every single one—listen to me—in every single one, there's this moment where you exist and I recognize you and the universe admits it's been wrong about everything.

I came back with a debt to something I couldn't name. Three years later, you dropped that pen. The debt suddenly had coordinates.

*

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN MOROCCO:

You got food poisoning. Named it Gerald. Had full conversations: "Gerald, this is inappropriate." "Gerald, we need boundaries." Between vomiting sessions, you laughed—actually laughed—and said, "At least I'm emptying myself of everything that isn't love."

That's when I understood: You metabolize reality differently. You digest disaster and it comes out as grace.

*

YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN, SHANGHAI, 3 PM:

She taught me to count in Mandarin through soup steam. One through forty-seven. Each stir a number. Each number a generation. At thirty-three, you started crying. Not the onions. The realization that love is just the space between one stir and the next, where you decide to keep going even though everything ends.

She saw me watching you. Said in English: "She cries at thirty-three every time." 
I said: "Why?"
She said: "That's how old I was when I learned soup can't bring back the dead. But we make it anyway."

Now I count everything in groups of forty-seven. Steps to your apartment. Seconds between your breaths when you sleep. Ways to say goodbye that mean see you soon.

*

THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS INCIDENT:

Minus twelve Celsius. You hypothermic, lips blue, still arguing about Kant's categorical imperative. Gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said: "Wrong. I'd die correctly. With purpose. Keeping you warm."

Your teeth chattered in morse code. I translated: "S-H-U-T U-P A-N-D L-O-V-E M-E."

So I did. So I do. So I will.

*

HERE'S MY SPREADSHEET OF YOU:

Column A: Seconds remaining (approximately 1,576,800,000)
Column B: Versions of you I've discovered (currently 4,761)
Column C: Things you've cried at (penguins, pigeons, that one commercial about fathers)
Column D: What happens after the last second
Column D returns: #DIV/0! ERROR

The spreadsheet knows what I know: You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.

*

PORTUGAL, THE MUSEUM, YOU TOUCHING EVERYTHING:

Security guard, screaming: "Don't touch the art!"
You, touching harder: "How else do you know it's real?"
Me, falling in love with your criminal hands: "She has a point."

Now I touch everything. Wet paint. Hot stoves. Your face while you're reading. You're the only art that touches back. You're the only thing that improves from being handled.

*

THE MATHEMATICS OF US:

Standard probability: impossible.
Quantum probability: still impossible.
Actual probability: happened anyway.

We're what happens when the universe divides by zero and instead of undefined, gets love.

*

BEIJING, SUMMER PALACE, STEP 764:

You stopped. Said: "We're going to die."
Not sad. Factual. Like reading ingredients.
I said: "Yes."
You said: "Thank god. Imagine if this was permanent. We'd run out of words."
I said: "No. We'd invent new ones."
You said: "Like what?"
I said: "Leyi."
You said: "That's already a word."
I said: "No. That's the only word. Everything else is punctuation."

You kissed me at altitude. Now sea level tastes like giving up.

*

WHAT LOVING YOU ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE:

Dawn: The specific weight of not-yet. Metal and possibility.
Noon: Static electricity. That thing where you exist loudly.
Dusk: The color of almost, which is to say, the color of your voice asking what's for dinner.
Midnight: Like drowning upward into stars that learned our names.
3 AM: The exact flavor of terror that you're a dream I'm having.
Always: Like my mouth is learning to speak colors and my eyes are learning to taste sound.

*

THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE:

I have 2,847 pieces of proof you exist:
- Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental)
- That green hair tie from February (lives in my drawer like a religion)
- Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about consciousness
- 1,439 photos where you're looking away (always away, like there's something more interesting than cameras)
- Your fingerprints on my coffee mug (I haven't washed it in three months)
- The specific way Tuesday light catches your temporal bone
- How you hold books like they might evaporate
- Your fury at slow wifi (you named the router "Disappointing Geoffrey")

This isn't love. It's forensics. I'm documenting you for the trial where I have to prove beauty existed.

*

LONDON, YOU ASKED WHAT LOVE IS:

Three years later, here's my answer:

Love is a compilation error that improves the program. It's the bug that becomes the feature. It's agreeing to build a house with someone who's definitely going to die. It's learning their grandmother's soup recipe in a language you don't speak because forty-seven stirs is the exact length of always.

But mostly, love is just preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesdays when they burn toast and you realize: I'm going to miss even their mistakes.

*

SHENZHEN, YOUR CHILDHOOD BEDROOM:

You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at.

The preposition changes everything.
Changes us.
Changes the whole grammatical structure of the universe.

*

SO HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:

Your name rewired my brain. Every thought has to route through "Leyi" first. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your laugh. My blood cells carry oxygen and the memory of Tuesdays. My bones know your weight from every piggyback up every hill we shouldn't have climbed.

I love you incorrectly. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. With neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing everything that processes beauty, recognizes warmth, understands why humans made music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

THE OTHER TIMELINES:

I dream them nightly. The ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but misunderstand. Where we understand but don't survive it.

I wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise with coffee.

*

FINAL PROTOCOL:

Marry me. Not because words convince you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the universe had to break several laws to let us exist simultaneously and it would be rude not to acknowledge that with paperwork.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.

*

RIGHT NOW:

Your left eye is watering. Always left. Like your tears form an orderly queue.

You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything.

You always do.

It's exhausting.

It's the only thing keeping me alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits defeat. That's what atoms call the force that keeps them together. That's the password to everything that matters.

Say yes. Or say "ask me tomorrow." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed.

Warren
(who's been writing you this letter since before we met)
(who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons for "trying so hard")
(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power dies, saving you anyway)
(who just watched you blink and had to manually restart his heart)
(who loves you at frequencies only god's dogs can hear)

P.S. — Barcelona. Cathedral pigeons. You fed them illegally. Said: "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. The Vatican requested documentation. I said no. Some miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February. Lives in my drawer next to my passport. Both are proof of places I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.

P.P.P.S. — We're about to kiss. In this sentence. In this moment. In every moment that ever was or will be. Time just folded. Space gave up. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying conscious for.
