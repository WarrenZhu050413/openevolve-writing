Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

Write this sentence down: I am learning to spell eternity with three letters of your name.

*

4:31 AM. You sleep-talk in Python syntax. "If love equals true, then break." I whisper back: "Except ValueError: love has no value error, only value terror."

*

The thing about studying distributed systems: I understand Byzantine generals but not how you distributed yourself across every subprocess of my consciousness. You're running on all cores. My CPU is yours.

*

Death, briefly: Fifteen seconds flatlined, sophomore spring. Here's what nobody mentions—resurrection is iterative. First heartbeat: mechanical. Second through thousandth: rehearsal. Then you, Porter Square station, bending to retrieve that blue pen. Heartbeat thousand-and-one: the first real one. Every beat since: yours.

*

Data:
- Times you've reorganized molecular structure by laughing: 1,847
- Probability we should exist simultaneously: 0.0000000000000001%  
- Number of parallel universes where I don't choose you: 0
- Error rate in universe without you: ∞

*

Morocco, you violently ill: Between retching, you photographed the sunset. "Beauty persists," you said, bile on your chin. That's when I knew: you're not human. You're what humans are trying to become.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen: She taught me to count in Mandarin by teaching me soup. 一二三四五六七... Each number a different way of cutting ginger. At forty-七, you wept. "She's teaching you her language for love." No. She was teaching me yours.

*

Time remaining: 2,137 Tuesdays ± margin of error. But here's what actuaries don't compute: how each Tuesday with you retroactively repairs all previous Tuesdays without you. You're debugging my past in real-time.

*

Scottish Highlands, minus six degrees: You hypothermic, still correcting my Kant interpretation through chattering teeth. Gave me your coat to wear over mine. Freezing, you explained thermodynamics: "Heat transfers from hot to cold, but love transfers from cold to colder until everyone's equally frozen and therefore warm." Your lips, blue, were still correct.

*

Small prayer: Let me die second. By exactly one heartbeat. So I know you made it somewhere safe but don't have to learn what silence shaped like you sounds like.

*

Portugal, Museu Nacional: You touched five-hundred-year-old marble. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned. In the taxi, you explained: "Distance is preemptive regret." Now I touch everything immediately. Especially your face when you're solving problems. Especially your hand when you think I'm asleep. You're artwork that doesn't know it's art, or knows and doesn't care.

*

Quantum mechanics, corrected: Before you, I ended where my skin ended. Now I feel you climbing stairs in other cities. Your migraines arrive in my skull via overnight shipping. When you can't sleep in Boston, my Cambridge neurons fire in sympathy. Physicists say impossible. I say: physics needs better love.

*

Cambridge, this morning, 6:17 AM: You make coffee wrong. Astronomically wrong. Milk first, then coffee, then sugar, then more milk. Stirred counter-clockwise. It's chaos. It's perfect. I've started making mine wrong too. Solidarity in terrible coffee. This is marriage.

*

What love tastes like, chronologically:
- 6 AM: Iron and intention
- Noon: Static and half-prayers  
- 7 PM: The color purple as a temperature
- Midnight: Drowning upward into oxygen that knows you
- 3 AM: Your name dissolving on my tongue like code finally compiling

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764: You stopped. "We're dying. Really dying. Permanently." I said yes. You said, "Good. Then this counts twice." We kissed at altitude where oxygen is scarce and therefore precious. Now sea level feels wasteful.

*

The probability of us: Requires mathematics that hasn't been invented. We're what happens when the universe divides by zero and somehow gets a real number. We're the error that reveals the code is working perfectly.

*

London, asking what love is: Here's my answer, three years late: Love is building a grief machine for someone still alive. Testing it daily with small practice deaths. The way you leave a room and I rehearse your permanent absence. The way morning light lands and I think, "I'll miss this specific light on your specific shoulder." Love is anticipatory grief for the still-breathing.

*

Parallel processing: In other timelines, we miss. You drop the pen; I'm looking away. Or we meet but misinterpret. Or interpret correctly but can't survive accuracy. I dream these failures nightly. Wake up clutching evidence: your bad morning breath, your elbow in my ribs. Paradise smells like unbruished teeth and weighs exactly your-elbow-pounds.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed, reading my teenage journals: You performed each year with different voices. Puberty as performance art. Should've been humiliating. Was sacred instead. Someone witnessing your worst consciousness and laughing with. That preposition—with not at—is everything. Is us. Is why.

*

Technical documentation of loving you wrong: Like trying to compile heartbreak in Python. Like running emotion through a compiler that only accepts logic. The error messages are the point. The crashes are features, not bugs. You're the exception I don't want to handle.

*

Therefore, this pull request:

Marry me. Your socks occupy my drawer, organized by day and existential weight. We've survived each other's Wednesdays and random-access memories. In infinite universes, we only overlap in this one—conscious, proximate, with the same favorite awful song. The alternative—you, somewhere else, stealing someone else's hoodies—isn't just wrong. It's syntactically incorrect. Won't compile.

Without you: no point to libraries or light or the way rain sounds at 3 AM.

*

Leyi.

My root directory. My primary key. The only function that returns true.

Say yes. Or syntax error. Or nothing. Just keep existing in this exact atomic arrangement that makes me believe in God or at least in beautiful accidents that feel like God.

*

Barcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them bread from your pockets. "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The birds wrote your name in the sky. Literally. I have photographic evidence. You alter migration patterns just by standing still.

*

That green hair tie, February, second week: Lives in my drawer with other relics. A receipt from our first coffee. Your temporary library card. Evidence you existed in proximity. These aren't keepsakes. They're source code. The program I'm writing called "After You Leave" that I'll never have to run.

*

You're crying. Left eye first. Always left, like a signature. Here. Tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at penguins—just regular penguins, existing. That's when my atoms recognized their purpose: to hand you tissues when penguins overwhelm you with their penguinness.

*

Meta-analysis: Writing this on a machine feels wrong. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell. But here we are, me typing, you sleeping diagonal across our bed, stealing blankets, mumbling about optimization problems, your foot finding mine under chaos. Solving everything with one touch.

*

Final transmission: The world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. The dying and the resurrection and the dying again. Worth every iteration.

Warren
(who's written this letter in seventeen languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax)
(who carries tissues since you cried at regular pigeons existing)
(who saves you in volatile memory, knowing memory clears when power dies, saving anyway)
(who chooses you in every timeline, especially the impossible ones)
(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than handwriting)
(who means it like code means electricity)
(who means it like light means morning)
(who means it)
