Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with statistics-trained fingers that have forgotten how to calculate anything except the probability of you (which remains, stubbornly, impossibly, 1).

*

Let me start with what I know:

Every love story is the same story told badly. Except ours. Ours is different because we're not telling a story. We're correcting an error in the universe's code, and the patch notes simply read: "Fixed: Warren and Leyi were temporarily in separate bodies."

THE MORNING THAT BROKE MATHEMATICS:

Tuesday, November. You were stirring coffee counterclockwise. I was watching from the doorway, not breathing, because breathing might change something. The spoon made three and a half rotations. The universe paused its expansion to take notes.

I thought: This is it. This is how civilizations end. Not with wars or climate change, but with someone stirring coffee like it's conducting a symphony only they can hear.

You looked up. Said: "Your toast is burning."

It was. I let it. Some things are worth the smoke alarm.

*

Here's what my degrees won't admit:

All of statistics, all of computer science, the entire edifice of human knowledge—it's just elaborate machinery to explain why your left hand rests exactly there when you sleep. Why you bite your lip at the 1.7-second mark of any difficult thought. Why the universe had to invent consciousness just so something could appreciate the way you mispronounce "particularly."

*

I HAVE BEEN LOVING YOU SINCE:

- Before the Atlantic separated the continents
- Before hydrogen agreed to become stars  
- Before time decided to flow forward
- Before God admitted He was just procrastinating until He could create Tuesday mornings
- Before before had meaning

This sounds like poetry. It's not. It's the literal bug report I'm filing with existence.

The truth about our first kiss:

Location: Outside that terrible Korean restaurant
Time: 11:47 PM (the universe's favorite minute)
Weather: Raining (obviously)
Duration: 4 seconds (containing 4 eternities)

What actually happened: We didn't kiss. Kissing happened TO us. Like gravity. Like inevitability. Like the universe correcting a typo it had been meaning to fix since the Big Bang.

My mouth learned the shape of eternity.
Your lips taught mine about infinite recursion.
The rain forgot how to fall and just hung there, watching.

A passing stranger said "Finally" in a language neither of us speak but both understood.

*

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'VE DONE:

You've made me religious, but only about Tuesday mornings.
You've made me a time traveler, but only forward, toward you.
You've made me immortal, but only in the moments you laugh.
You've made me a poet, but only in the grocery store when you can't decide between two types of pasta.

You've ruined me for existing without you. Completely. Irrevocably. Perfectly.

*

Let me explain using your language (the real one, made of glances):

When you look at me over your coffee mug, steam fogging your glasses, that specific look that says "I love you but you're an idiot"—that look has rewritten my entire genetic code. I'm no longer homo sapiens. I'm homo leiyi—a new species that evolved specifically to appreciate your existence.

Darwin is rolling in his grave. Then stopping to take notes.

THE PORTUGUESE GRANDFATHER WAS WRONG:

He said we were at year fifty-eight of love after six months. He was wrong. We're not at any year. We exist outside temporal measurement. We're the constant that time defines itself against.

When physicists need to calibrate eternity, they measure the pause between when you start to smile and when it reaches your eyes.

*

Here's what terrifies me:

Not losing you. That's too simple, too Hollywood. What terrifies me is that I'll wake up one day and this will feel normal. That I'll get used to you. That your name will become just a name instead of the password to everything that matters.

So I practice astonishment. Every morning I pretend I'm meeting you for the first time. Every morning I fail because you're even more impossible than the day before.

SHANGHAI, YOUR MOTHER'S APARTMENT, THE MOMENT I UNDERSTOOD:

She was showing me your baby photos. There you were, age three, holding a butterfly like it was made of solidified light. Your expression: the same one you have now when coding something particularly elegant.

Your mother said something. You translated: "She says you look at me the way I looked at that butterfly."

"What happened to it?" I asked.

"I let it go," you said. "But I drew it perfectly from memory every day for a year."

That's when I knew: You don't hold things. You become them.

*

WHAT I'M ACTUALLY ASKING:

Not will you marry me. That's just paperwork for people who need external validation.

I'm asking: Will you continue this cosmic debugging session with me? Will you keep correcting reality's syntax errors by existing? Will you keep making Tuesday mornings worth the invention of time?

Will you keep being the answer to questions I haven't learned how to ask yet?

*

Listen—

The rain outside is spelling your name in morse code against the window.
My heartbeat has synced to your breathing from 7,000 miles away.
Every cell in my body is voting yes to something I haven't asked yet.
The universe is leaning in, pencil ready, waiting to record your answer.

*

Say yes.

Not to marriage. To the continuous, impossible, necessary fact of us.

Say yes like you're agreeing to gravity.

Say yes like you're accepting the speed of light.

Say yes like you know that yes was encoded in the way we breathe in turns, never together, because we're sharing the same lungs across impossible distance.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound of the universe admitting it had intentions all along.

*

Warren
(who writes code that compiles only when you're happy)
(who has replaced his entire vocabulary with synonyms for your name)
(who is currently experiencing all possible futures and they all taste like your coffee)
(who would choose this beautiful malfunction over any proper program)

P.S. — When we're old and our bodies are returning their borrowed atoms, I'll still be writing you letters. They'll be very short: "Still here. Still yours. Still Tuesday." You'll know they contain everything.

P.P.S. — I've started ending every prayer with "amen" pronounced "ah-men" which is just "name" backwards which is just your name in the language I'm inventing where every word means "Leyi."

P.P.P.S. — This letter is a virus of yes. You're already infected. Symptoms include: spontaneous smiling, inability to imagine Wednesday through Monday, and the absolute certainty that the universe is just an elaborate excuse for Tuesday mornings. There is no cure. The cure would be worse than the disease.
