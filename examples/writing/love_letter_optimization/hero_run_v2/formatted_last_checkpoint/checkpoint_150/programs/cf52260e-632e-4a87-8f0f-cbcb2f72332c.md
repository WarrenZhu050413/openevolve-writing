Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with both hands. The left one to steady the right. The right one to tell you what the left already knows.

*

Documentation of a systems failure: My body used to be hardware. Predictable. Input/output. Then you pronounced my name wrong—not wrong, differently—and suddenly I'm running unauthorized software. Every cell executing commands I didn't write. My immune system added you to its whitelist without administrative approval. My neurons fire in patterns that spell your name in languages that don't exist yet.

*

True story from the morgue of my twenties: Cardiac arrest. Seventeen seconds of clinical death. The doctors say I said nothing when I came back. They're wrong. I said "not yet"—but in a frequency only my atoms could hear. They were refusing to disperse until they met what they were waiting for. Three years later: you, in Porter Square, dropping a pen I'm still picking up.

*

Here's what I actually study at Harvard: Distributed systems. How to make machines agree across time zones, across failures, across the impossible distances between intention and execution. But you? You make my distributed self achieve consensus instantly. Every part of me votes yes. Even the parts that haven't been invented yet.

*

Morocco. You got food poisoning in the blue city. Held your hair back while you renegotiated with existence. Between retches, you laughed—actually laughed—and said "the tagine was worth it." That's when I understood: you metabolize joy differently. Extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. I want to study your digestive system, but for happiness.

*

The Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket over mine. I said "you'll die." You said "warmer than living cold." Your lips were blue but you meant it. That's the thing—you always mean it. Even your mistakes are sincere. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was real.

*

I've been keeping evidence:

Shanghai: Your grandmother taught you soup in forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three. Not onions. The moment her hands became yours through the spoon.

Cambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. Got us almost arrested. "How else do you know genius is real?" you asked the guard.

Beijing: Nine hundred steps at the Summer Palace. You kissed me at the top. "See? Altitude improves everything." Now sea level feels like disappointment.

Boston: Power outage. We played cards by phone light. You cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for the concept of deception.

*

Portugal. That museum where you touched the art. Banned forever. Your fingerprints still on 500-year-old marble, insisting on contact across centuries. That's what you do—you insist on touching what shouldn't be touched. Including me. Especially me.

*

Listen to what you've done to mathematics: We have 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me violent. Not sad—violent. I want to break into wherever they manufacture time and perform a hostile takeover. Redistribute all future moments. To us. Only us.

*

Your laugh reorganizes matter at the quantum level. I've measured this. When you laugh, particles in the room behave differently. Photons arrive faster. Gravity lessens by 0.003%. It's not poetry. It's what happens when someone exists at a frequency that makes the universe reconsider its constants.

*

What terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup, no disaster recovery. If you system-crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to a specific Tuesday when you sang to broken coffee makers like they were just very tired and needed encouragement.

*

The ugly truth: I document you obsessively. 1,847 entries. How you hold pencils (wrong). Your fury at slow wifi (righteous). The way you'll age (already visible in certain light—those lines from squinting at screens I want to trace like maps of survived time). This isn't romance. It's anthropology. I'm studying you like you're the last speaker of a dying language I need to preserve.

*

Shenzhen. My childhood bedroom. You found my teenage journals. Read them out loud in dramatic voices. I should have been mortified. Instead I thought: this. This is what holiness is. Someone reading your worst attempts at humanity and laughing with you, not at you. With. The preposition matters.

*

So here's my formal proposal to the universe: Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful—it's not. Because your toothbrush knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.

*

Remember London? You asked what love actually is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated decisions you can't ctrl+z. Watch:

Decision 1: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were swearing at parking meters. I play it when you travel.

Decision 2: Learning Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet.

Decision 3: Carrying tissues since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing.

Decision 4-1,847: [Files corrupted by excess tenderness]

*

What you taste like: Morning is copper pennies and possibility. Afternoon is static before thunderstorms. Evening is the specific silence between heartbeats. 3 AM is the color blue if blue were a texture. Always is drowning upward into oxygen.

*

Final confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes. Diseases with Latin names. Spontaneous quantum dissolution. Then you do something stupid—like putting my socks on your hands and pretending they're puppets discussing Kant—and all my disaster scenarios delete themselves out of respect for joy.

*

The deepest bug in my code: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.

*

Spain. Barcelona. You illegally fed the cathedral pigeons. Said "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed your name in the sky. I'm not being metaphorical. They literally spelled L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random. Too random to be programmed. Too specifically you to be anything but miraculous.

*

Leyi.

That's my root password. My recovery phrase. My authentication token. The only command that executes correctly every time.

*

Say yes. Or say "ask me again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe in infinity despite the evidence.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this letter in different languages including C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who wrote your name in condensation on windows until the glass learned to fog in cursive, who counts your breaths at night—seventeen times—because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends)

P.S. — I lied. It wasn't fifteen seconds. It was seventeen. But seventeen felt like prophecy. Like the universe was showing me exactly how long I could survive without you: seventeen seconds. Not one more.

P.P.S. — Your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. Lives in my desk drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.

P.P.P.S. — You just smiled. That specific smile where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us. Both is the only way to love someone when you know that time is real and runs out.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of historical masterpieces. It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the revolutionary compression of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). The technical metaphor system shows innovation beyond Napoleon's directness (82) but doesn't achieve Keats's negative capability (81). The accumulation of specific moments ("Portugal. That museum where you touched the art") recalls Wilde's concrete detail (80) but with less linguistic economy. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur work and true literary achievement - showing real talent and moments of brilliance without the transformative power of the greatest examples. The score of 72.75 (weighted average) reflects work that's genuinely distinguished, with proto-masterful elements, but still a meaningful distance from immortality.
