Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I just watched you argue with an automated voice menu for twelve minutes. You won. The machine apologized. This is why I'm writing.

*

Listen: I've been dead for seventeen seconds. Sophomore year, before your coordinates existed in my universe. The doctors said "syncope." I say: preview of a world without you. When my heart restarted, it was already spelling your name in morse code. You weren't born yet in my timeline. My future was bleeding backwards through my ribs.

*

THE MOROCCO INCIDENT:

Six hours. Hexagonal tiles. You, turning yourself inside out on a bathroom floor while I sat outside counting your breaths through the door. When you emerged—translucent, trembling—you introduced me to Philippe (the toilet) like he was your new best friend. You'd given him a whole backstory: French, divorced, trying his best. That's when I understood: you transform suffering into tenderness so pure it could restart dead stars.

*

Shanghai. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven clockwise stirs, three counter. She watched me—this boy who loved you in broken Mandarin and perfect desperation—and said: "他的魂儿跟着她走" (His soul follows where she goes). Not romantic. Diagnostic. Like she could see the invisible thread between us, taught as piano wire, humming at a frequency only the ancient can hear.

*

I need to tell you what you actually are:

You're not the love of my life. You're the reason life invented love. You're the debugging process that made consciousness realize it was running the wrong program. You're the comment in the margin that explains why the universe bothered existing at all.

*

Portugal, Lisbon, the museum guard yelling while you touched the 500-year-old stone: "Someone needs to know we were here," you said, pressing harder. "The stone is lonely for human warmth." This is your thesis: that matter has memory, that love leaves fingerprints on atoms, that we can make the universe remember us by insisting hard enough.

*

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS TO REALITY WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM:

- Gravity recalculates its commitments
- Light remembers it has opinions about beauty  
- Air molecules form tiny symphonies around your breathing
- Time gets nervous and forgets which direction it's supposed to go
- My DNA unspools completely, rewrites itself with your name in every gene

*

Scottish Highlands. You were dying—actually dying—of cold. Lips blue as forgotten languages. Still philosophizing: "What if death is just consciousness changing states? Like water to ice?" I kissed you to stop your heart from stopping. You tasted like the last theorem in a proof of God. Like revolution crystallizing at absolute zero.

*

True confession: I practice losing you. Daily. In small, manageable doses. I imagine the phone call, the hospital corridor, the impossible after. It's agonizing. It's necessary. Because loving you this much means accepting that one day the universe will commit its cruelest accounting error and subtract you from existence. This rehearsal is my only defense against that future violence.

*

Your diary, age seven, Shenzhen: "I dreamed about someone who hasn't been invented yet. When they make him, he'll love me during my worst moments." Twenty years before we met, you were already writing my operating instructions. This isn't poetry. This is causality running in reverse, effect summoning its cause from the future.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764. You stopped mid-stride: "This exact stone has been waiting since the Qing dynasty for us to stand on it together." The guard started yelling. You yelled back: "历史需要被触摸!" (History needs to be touched!). He laughed until he cried. This is your superpower: making authority recognize its own absurdity, making strangers accomplices in your small insurrections against forgetting.

*

WHAT I NEVER TOLD YOU:

Every decision I make branches into two timelines: one where you're there, one where you're not. I live exclusively in the first timeline but I can see the second one through peripheral vision. It's a wasteland. It's me, efficiently arranged into the shape of a person but missing the essential software. It's carbon pretending to have purpose.

*

London. The question that broke me: "What would you do if I died first?" Twenty seconds of silence while I drowned in the hypothetical. Then: "Build a very precise argument about why that's unacceptable and submit it to the universe for review." You laughed while crying. We made love like we were writing a proof against mortality.

*

The mathematics of Tuesday mornings: You steal my coffee (theft). You replace it with yourself (substitution). The coffee becomes irrelevant (simplification). This is love: the process by which all variables reduce to you.

*

Barcelona cathedral. You fed communion wafers to pigeons while explaining transubstantiation to tourists in three languages. The priest called security. Security took photos instead. The pigeons formed a perfect double helix in the air. You said: "See? Even God's accidents know how to dance." This is how you move through the world: making the sacred ordinary, making the ordinary sacred, refusing the difference.

*

So here's my pull request:

Marry me. Not because this letter works. Because we've already been married in every universe that counts. Because I've A/B tested existing with and without you and the results are conclusive: without you, I'm just very organized emptiness. Because in every quantum branch, every possible timeline, every hypothetical reality, we choose each other. The paperwork is just courtesy to a universe that likes documentation.

*

Here's what I promise: To love you like a broken compass that only points to you. To love you like an emergency broadcast that never stops transmitting. To love you past the heat death of the universe, when all that's left is the memory of your Tuesday morning hands.

*

The deepest frequency of truth: You're going to die. I'm going to die. Entropy will win. The universe will forget its own name.

So?

We happened. Against odds so impossible that mathematics gives up and calls it magic. We found each other in the space between heartbeats, in the pause between words, in the moment between existing and not.

That's the only physics that matters.

*

Right now, you're about to cry from the left eye first. You always do. You're going to say this letter is too much. You're wrong. It's not enough. Language ends where you begin. I'm sending this incomplete, like everything true, like everything that tries to say "I love you" and discovers those words are just the starting coordinates for something infinite.

*

Leyi.

Your name is the only equation that balances.
The only code that compiles without errors.
The only prayer that receives a response.

Say yes. Or say nothing. Or just exist for another nanosecond in my vicinity. All three are synonyms in the language we're building between heartbeats.

Warren
(who loves you like a syntax error that makes the whole program finally work)
(who carries your spare everything: hair ties, phone chargers, reasons to believe in tomorrow)
(who learned that love isn't a feeling—it's a location, and its coordinates are wherever you are)

P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023? It's the most important object in the universe. Not because of what it is, but because of where it's been: wrapped around your wrist while you rewrote the rules of what a human can mean to another human.

P.P.S. — This morning you asked why I was staring. The truth: I was memorizing you in case the universe tries to delete you from the mainframe. I'm the backup drive for every version of you that's ever existed. This is love: redundant storage against the possibility of loss.

P.P.P.S. — I love you. Grammatically perfect. Ontologically necessary. The shortest complete program in the universe. Also the only one that matters.
