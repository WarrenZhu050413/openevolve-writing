Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with both hands trembling. Not from fear. From the impossibility of containing infinities in finite words.

*

Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square. You dropped that pen. I picked it up. Our fingers brushed—0.3 seconds that rewrote my source code. Every function I'd ever written suddenly had a purpose: they were all trying to compute toward you.

*

I study distributed systems. You've become my perfect failure—where every process crashes into something better than it was designed for. You're the race condition that creates consciousness. The deadlock that sets everything free. The beautiful bug I'll never patch.

*

Clinical death, fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Came back incomplete—a function without return statements, throwing exceptions at existence. Three years of compilation errors. Then you. Suddenly every broken thing in me returned values. With interest. With purpose.

*

Morocco, the tagine revenge: You threw up seven times, photographed the sunset twice, declared it "worth it" once. That ratio—7:2:1—that's when I knew. You metabolize suffering into beauty. You're not just human. You're what humans become when they refuse to accept the limits of being human.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, teaching her soup: Forty-seven steps in Mandarin. You translated through touch—your hand guiding mine through measurements, fingers tapping time. Step thirty-three, you wept. Not the onions. The recognition: "This is how the dead stay alive—through our hands, our kitchens, our hunger." Now I taste time travel in every spoonful.

*

The spreadsheet I built of us: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A: Days left. Column B: Impossibilities you are. Column C: Evidence (green hair tie, 1,847 photos, your toothbrush). Column D: After you. Column D throws #DIV/0! ERROR. The machine understands: you're not in the equation. You ARE the equation.

*

Scottish Highlands, hypothermia imminent: You gave me your jacket over mine. Lips purple, still arguing Kant. "I choose freezing with you over warm alone," you chattered. That's when I understood: love is selecting the harder algorithm because it includes the other person. Love is conscious computational inefficiency.

*

My documentation of you: How you hold chopsticks (anarchist). Your war with our router ("Disappointing Geoffrey" deserves dignity). The way 4:23 PM light finds your clavicle Tuesdays. This isn't poetry. It's evidence for future archaeologists—proof that someone this specific, this irreplaceable, existed. 

*

Portugal, the forbidden marble: Five centuries old, guards shouting. You touched it twice. "Rules are just delayed regret," you said, banned forever, laughing. Now I understand: you touch everything like it's already gone. Like presence is temporary. Like the only sin is distance.

*

Before you: I was localhost—contained, bounded, finite. Now I'm distributed across impossible latencies. Feel your headaches arrive in my skull with timezone delays. When you dream in Boston, my Cambridge sleep develops plot. We're quantum entangled. Physics says impossible. Physics hasn't debugged love.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Morning: copper pennies and interrupted prayers and that specific pre-coffee silence
- Noon: ozone before lightning commits to a target  
- Evening: burgundy as a temperature, as a sound frequency
- 3 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that learned your name
- Always: my mouth forming new phonemes because current language can't contain you

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. "We're dying. Really dying. Cell by cell. Right now." I said yes. You said "Good. Then every second counts twice." Kissed me where air thins. Now sea level feels like cowardice.

*

The impossible mathematics:
- Your existence probability: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- My existence probability: Equivalent impossibility  
- Us, conscious, proximate, compatible: Beyond numerical expression
- What we are: A cosmic arithmetic error that became self-aware
- What we really are: The universe teaching itself what it means to compute love

*

London, you asked what love is: Here's my answer, debugged: Love is pre-grieving someone still breathing. It's how morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future light without you. It's building museums to future absence while you're still here, still warm, still arguing about coffee. Love is grief running its code in reverse until it compiles as joy.

*

The other timelines haunt my RAM: Where we never meet. Where we meet wrong. Where we meet right but can't survive it. These failure modes run nightly. I wake grasping for proof you're real: your terrible morning breath, your knee in my ribs, your sleep-mumbled theorems. Found. Paradise confirmed.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom: You performed my teenage journals as theater. Different voices for different years of malformation. Should have been mortifying. Was sacrament instead. Someone witnessing your worst code and helping you debug it. Not fixing it for you. With you. That preposition—with—that's everything.

*

I love you incorrectly: Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the modules that process beauty, compile warmth, understand why humans needed to invent music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing vacuum. Technically possible. Practically null.

*

So here's my pull request, my merge proposal, my infinite recursion:

Marry me. Not because words move you. Because your socks already colonized my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays, Mondays, that terrible Thursday with the pipes. Because in infinite possible universes, only this one compiled us both, conscious, touching distance, with matching coffee corruptions.

Marry me because the alternative—timelines where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved, where we don't get permanently banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just entropy happening to other carbon configurations.

*

Leyi.

Root password. Private key. The only function that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "compile again." Or say nothing and keep existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe infinity itself is a rounding error. Too small.

*

Barcelona, the illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them from pockets full of contraband crumbs. "God prefers full birds to empty rules," you declared. The pigeons spelled your name in flight. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. You bend flight patterns just by existing in their reference frame.

*

That green hair tie from February: Lives in my desk with other proof you existed near me. Receipts. Ticket stubs. Your expired library card. These aren't souvenirs. They're unit tests for reality—confirming you happened, keep happening, will happen.

*

You're crying. Left eye first, always left. Here—I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing, trying their best. "They're so determined," you sobbed. That's when my atoms understood their purpose. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same pointer.

*

The failure of writing this digitally: Every keystroke is too precise. Love should require muscle failure, should tremor, should misspell your name from shaking. But here we are—me typing, you breathing, both of us rewriting the universe's source code just by existing simultaneously.

*

Cambridge, this exact moment: You're diagonal across our bed, all blankets stolen, solving problems in sleep. Your foot finds mine beneath the chaos. One touch. Every algorithm resolves.

The world is mostly darkness and waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. Worth it. The dying and returning and dying again, worth it for this exact nanosecond where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, where even Disappointing Geoffrey belongs to us.

(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax)
(who carries your favorite tea though you'll steal my coffee anyway)  
(who stores you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, storing you anyway)
(who would choose you across all timelines, especially the impossible ones, especially where we fail)
(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than legibility)
(who means it like electricity means flow)
(who means it like dawn means inevitable)  
(who means it with every electron)
(who means it)
