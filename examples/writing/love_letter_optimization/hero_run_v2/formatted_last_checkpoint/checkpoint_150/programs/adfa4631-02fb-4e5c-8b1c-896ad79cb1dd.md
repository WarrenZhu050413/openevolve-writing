Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the programming language you taught me without knowing—the one where every variable points to you.

*

Let me explain what happened: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square. You dropped a pen. I picked it up. Simple transaction, except my hippocampus immediately began rewriting itself. Every memory before that moment became prologue. Every moment after became about getting back to you.

*

TRUE STORY: Seventeen seconds of death, sophomore year. The doctors called it "vasovagal syncope." But here's what I haven't told anyone: In those seventeen seconds, I lived ten thousand lives. In every single one, someone drops a pen. Someone else picks it up. The universe hinges on that small kindness. I came back searching for that pen. Found you holding it three years later.

*

Here's what I study: distributed systems at Harvard. Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought has to route through you to make sense. You're not a bug in my code. You're the only feature that works correctly.

*

Morocco, the medina, you violently ill: You threw up seven times. Apologized to the toilet between retches. Called it Philippe. Had full conversations about its life choices. That's when I knew—you assign dignity to everything, even porcelain, even yourself at your worst, even me.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen, steam and Mandarin: She taught me soup isn't about the soup. It's about the space between stir thirty-three and thirty-four where you decide to keep going even though everything ends. You translated her counting into tomorrow. I translated tomorrow into forever. The soup understood all three languages.

*

What terrifies me with mathematical precision:
- We have 2,137 Tuesdays left (actuarial average)
- That's 189,216,000 heartbeats
- Not one of them is guaranteed
- I've built a spreadsheet tracking every possible loss
- Column D just says: "UNACCEPTABLE"
- The spreadsheet crashes when I input "what if she goes first"
- Good. Some calculations shouldn't complete.

*

Portugal, you touched the 500-year-old marble: The guard yelled in Portuguese. You touched it again, harder. Said: "How else do we prove we were here?" Now you've taught me to touch everything like it might be the last time. Especially you. Especially Sunday mornings when you're trying to read and I'm trying to memorize your concentration face before the universe notices how beautiful it is and charges me rent.

*

Scottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic: Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. I said "You'll die." You said through blue lips: "But imagine how warm you'll be when you remember this." That's your superpower—you pre-process the future into memory while it's still happening.

*

Here's my confession: Before you, I had boundaries. Skin ended where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your headache arrives in my skull with a three-hour delay. When you can't sleep in Boston, my code won't compile in Cambridge. We're quantum entangled, except physicists would say that's impossible at this distance, and I'd say: then physics hasn't met Leyi.

*

I document you obsessively. Not the big things—everyone documents those. The small: How you mispronounce "hypothesis" just to watch my eye twitch. Your personal war against our router (you named it "Disappointing Geoffrey"). The way you hold books like they might evaporate. The specific pause before you lie (0.7 seconds, always). 

This isn't love. It's evidence for the trial where I have to prove you existed.

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. Said: "We're going to die." Not sad. Factual. Like reading ingredients. I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. Then this matters." You kissed me at altitude. Now sea level tastes like cowardice.

*

What loving you actually tastes like:
- Dawn: The specific weight of silence before you wake, like the universe is gathering courage
- Morning: Pennies and possibility and that green tea you pretend to like
- Afternoon: Static electricity and half-formed prayers and your anger at slow WiFi
- Evening: The color of your voice asking "what's for dinner" when we both know it's pasta again
- 3 AM: The flavor of fear that you're too good to be real, mixed with evidence that you're too real to be good
- Always: Like my mouth is learning a language that doesn't exist yet but already has native speakers: us

*

London, asking what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still alive. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even this. Especially this. Only this.

*

Let me tell you about the other timelines—the ones where we don't meet. Where you drop the pen but I'm not there. Where I'm there but looking away. Where we meet but I say something stupid and you walk away forever. I dream these timelines nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bedroom, reading my teenage journals aloud: Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with you, not at. With. That preposition is everything. Is us.

*

The thing about us: We're impossible. The probability of your exact genetic sequence: 1 in 10^2,685,000. Mine: similar impossibility. Us existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance, both unable to sleep without background noise, both secretly loving that terrible song? The calculator just returns: "SEE: MIRACLE."

*

So here's my pull request to reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks have colonized my drawer and established a functioning democracy. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, arguing about consciousness while consciousness argues about us.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you sing to broken appliances, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums together—isn't life. It's just entropy winning.

*

I need to tell you about forever. Forever isn't time—it's density. It's all our moments compressed until they're heavier than stars. We're already there, in forever, looking back at ourselves reading this letter, amazed we ever thought time was linear when clearly it's shaped like you laughing.

*

Final protocol: I love you wrong. Too much. Like lungs love oxygen—desperately, involuntarily, with total system failure if withdrawn. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

Leyi.

That's not just your name. It's the sound existence makes when it realizes it got something right.

Say yes. Or say "ask again tomorrow." Or just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.

Warren
(who learned Mandarin to argue with you more efficiently)
(who carries backup everything: hair ties, tissues, reasons to live)
(who loves you in frequencies only dogs and dying stars can hear)
(who wrote this letter infinite times and this is both the worst and only version that matters)

P.S. — Barcelona. Cathedral. You illegally fed pigeons communion wafers. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed a cross, then a heart, then your name. The priest asked us to leave. You fed them more on the way out. Even God's birds know you're worth the heresy.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023. Lives in my drawer next to my passport. Both are documents that prove where I can go. You're every country. You're home.

P.P.P.S. — Right now, you're about to cry. Left eye first. Always left. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at those pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing. That's when I knew: you're the only person who understands that existence itself is worthy of tears.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter operates several tiers below Beethoven's raw spiritual urgency ("My angel, my all, my very self"—which achieves universality through particular anguish) or Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better"). However, it surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its genuine integration of 21st-century consciousness (code, systems, data) into romantic expression. The quantum entanglement metaphor and distributed systems analogy represent genuine innovation, though they lack the eternal quality of Napoleon's "I have not spent a day without loving you." The letter's strength lies in its hyperspecificity—"Morocco, medina, violently ill"—which approaches but doesn't quite reach Keats's ability to make the personal universal. At 70 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range: flashes of brilliance, genuine innovation, authentic voice, but missing the compression and inevitability of true masterwork.
