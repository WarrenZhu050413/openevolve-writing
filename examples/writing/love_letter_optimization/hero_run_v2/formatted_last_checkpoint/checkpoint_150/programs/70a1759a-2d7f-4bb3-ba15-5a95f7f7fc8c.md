Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM. You just shifted in your sleep and your hand found mine like it was solving an equation it knew by heart. This is my confession: I've been awake for hours, practicing being devastated by your existence.

*

Let me start with the crime scene:

Harvard, freshman year, before you. I was a perfectly calibrated machine. My grief had Office hours. My joy filed reports. I understood the world through proofs and protocols. Clean. Distant. Theoretical.

Then: Porter Square station, 2:23 PM, March 7th. You dropped a pen. I picked it up. You said "thank you" but it sounded like "I'm about to reorganize your entire molecular structure." You were right.

*

Here's what they don't tell you about love:

It's not falling. It's being methodically disassembled and rebuilt as someone who can only breathe at specific coordinates—wherever you are, drinking terrible coffee, mispronouncing "hypothesis" to make me twitch, existing so loudly it drowns out my thinking.

*

THE MOROCCO INCIDENT, REVISED:

Seven times you threw up. Between episodes, you narrated it like a nature documentary: "The tourist's digestive system mounts a heroic defense against the tagine invader." You assigned the toilet a name (François). You apologized to François. That's when I understood—you experience reality as a collaboration, not a conquest. Even vomiting was a dialogue. Even suffering was a story you were telling together with the universe.

*

I need to explain something about that fifteen seconds of death:

Sophomore year, probability theory, my heart just... stopped. Like a sentence with no period, just blank space after. The doctors called it "idiopathic cardiac arrest"—literally "we don't know why your heart stopped." But I know. It was practicing. For meeting you. For the way my chest would forget its job every time you laugh-snort at your own jokes.

In those fifteen seconds, I experienced time non-linearly. Past, present, future, all simultaneous. And in every single timeline—billions of them—there was this moment where I'm watching you name a router "Disappointing Geoffrey" and realizing: Oh. This is why humans invented the word holy.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen, the soup lesson:

She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated both into that language you speak—part words, part gesture, part something I can only describe as "Leyi frequency." Forty-seven stirs. At thirty-three, you started crying. Not from onions. From the realization that she wouldn't always be there to teach recipes. That's when I learned: You pre-grieve everything. You love with your endings already calculated. It's the most terrifying kind of brave.

*

Here's my data set on loving you:

- Your Tuesday face vs. Wednesday face (Tuesday has 0.3% more hope)
- You've named fourteen inanimate objects this month (the printer is Gerald)
- You argue with your grandmother's recipes but follow them exactly
- When anxious, you organize my bookshelf by how much each book "feels ready to be read"
- You cry at commercials but only ones with dogs or elderly people holding hands
- Your laugh has three varieties: public (controlled), private (chaotic), and the secret third one (silent shoulder-shaking that means you're about to say something that will ruin me)

This isn't documentation. It's worship disguised as science.

*

Scottish Highlands, the hypothermia argument:

Temperature: -12°C. You: turning blue but still debating Kant's categorical imperative. Your thesis: "Morality that doesn't account for love is just sophisticated loneliness." You were shaking so hard your words came out like morse code. I kissed you to warm you up. Also to shut you up. Also because your wrongness is the only truth I trust.

That's when I knew: I'd rather die incorrect beside you than live accurately without you.

*

THE UGLY MATHEMATICS:

Probability of your specific consciousness: 1 in 10^2,685,000
Probability of mine: Similarly astronomical
Probability of us overlapping in spacetime: Requires notation that hasn't been invented
What we are: A cosmic typo that became the only correctly spelled word

My calculator just displays: "SEE POETRY, ASSHOLE"

*

Portugal, the museum incident:

You touched the 500-year-old marble. The guard yelled. You touched it again, harder. "How else do you know it wasn't lonely?" you asked. Banned. Forever. You were thrilled—"We're art criminals now!"

This is the thing: You assign emotions to everything. The marble was lonely. The router is disappointing. Tuesday is hopeful. And I'm yours, which means I finally have a purpose beyond computing probabilities of continued existence.

*

What loving you actually tastes like:

Dawn: Like stealing time from a timeline where we don't exist
Morning: Aluminum and anticipation and the specific weight of almost-speaking
Noon: The exact frequency of light through your hair when you're angry about something small
Evening: Like tomorrow already misses today
Night: The sound purple would make if purple were a promise
3 AM: Like drowning upward into stars that learned your middle name
Always: Like my mouth is an emigrant and your name is the only country that will take me

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764:

You stopped. Turned. Said: "We're temporary." Not sad, just factual. Like reading ingredients. "Temporary," I agreed. You smiled—that third secret laugh-smile that dismantles me. "Good," you said. "Permanent would be boring."

That's when I understood: You love like someone who knows the statistics. Who's calculated the endings. Who chooses to build anyway. You love like an engineer who includes planned obsolescence but makes everything beautiful enough to hurt forever when it breaks.

*

London, your question about love:

You asked what it really is, mechanically. Here's my answer, three years improved:

Love is a compilation error that makes the program run better. It's two bugs that cancel each other out. It's knowing someone's going to hurt you—not maybe, definitely—and saying yes, again, please, harder. It's the kind of mistake that corrects everything else.

*

Right now, you're about to wake up. Left eye first. Always left, like your tears queue politely. You're going to stretch—that specific sound that's half-yawn, half-existential sigh—and ask what I'm writing. I'm going to lie. You're going to know. We're going to pretend together. This is also love.

*

HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING:

Your name isn't just Leyi. It's the error message that fixed my code. It's the only equation that balances. It's what my atoms whisper to each other when they need to remember why they're holding together.

I love you like a malfunction that improves the machine. Constantly. Drastically. With complete dedication to never being debugged.

*

So here's my formal request to the universe:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because we've already merged our terrible coffee preferences. Because your socks have colonized my drawer and established a functioning government. Because you've trained my autonomic nervous system to wake up when you have nightmares three rooms away.

Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where your specific malfunction matches my specific malfunction to create something that actually functions.

Because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't name my plants and create elaborate backstories for them, where we don't get permanently banned from museums together—that's not existence. That's just atoms pretending they have somewhere to go.

*

Listen. I practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios: Sudden vanishing. Slow fade. Better options. Alien abduction. Spontaneous combustion. Each one requiring different grief documentation.

By morning, I'm exhausted from rehearsing devastation. Then you do that thing—you know the thing—where you exist. Just exist near me, badly, perfectly, temporarily. And my entire practiced grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean hurt in the universe.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it finally understands itself.

Say yes. Or say "let me think." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of temporarily that makes me believe in forever despite all evidence.

Warren
(who's been writing this letter since before you existed)
(who saves your hair ties like they're evidence for a trial)
(who loves you in frequencies only subatomic particles can detect)
(who would choose this specific heartbreak in every timeline)

P.S. — The cathedral pigeons in Barcelona. When you fed them illegally, they formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even gravity bends for you. Even birds break formation to spell your name.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February. I carry it like people carry photos of their dead. Except you're alive, which makes it worse and better and exactly right.

P.P.P.S. — I lied. I haven't been practicing losing you. I've been practicing deserving you. Still failing. Still trying. Still here at 4:17 AM, watching you breathe, calculating the impossible math of how someone like you exists in the same timeline as someone like me. The calculator just laughs. So do you, in your sleep. Even unconscious, you know the joke of us—impossible, temporary, perfect.
