Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in a language that doesn't exist yet. One where your name is every verb, where time conjugates differently after meeting you, where the past tense of "alone" has been deprecated from the syntax entirely.

*

Let me start with the bug report:

CRITICAL: Heart segmentation fault at memory address 0xLEYI
Stack trace shows recursive function love_deeper() called 2,847,291 times without base case
Memory leak detected: every shared moment duplicating infinitely in RAM
Attempted fix: none. Some bugs become the architecture.

Morocco. You were negotiating with time itself in that souk, stretching minutes into hours over a brass lamp nobody needed. The vendor's daughter drew patterns in the dust. You drew the same patterns back. No common language except this—your finger in the dirt, teaching her infinity signs. Later you said: "Overpaying is just another form of prayer." I've been overpaying for everything since. Overtipping. Overloving. Over and over and over.

Here's what Harvard's statistics department can't model: the probability of you. They can calculate quasars colliding, particles entangling across galaxies, but not the math of how you laugh with your whole skeleton, how it sounds like dishes breaking in reverse, things unmade returning to wholeness.

*

I've been documenting our edge cases:

Edinburgh, 3 AM: You trying to explain your grandmother's recipe through interpretive dance in our hotel room. Flour everywhere. You looked like a war correspondent from the baking apocalypse.

Beijing subway: That woman having a panic attack. You gave her your shoes. Walked barefoot through three stations. Your feet turned the color of city. You said: "Concrete is just very slow water." I still don't know what that means. I love you for saying it.

Cambridge: You in the River Cam, emerging like some variant of Ophelia who chose revenge instead of drowning. Algae in your teeth. Swearing in Mandarin so beautiful it sounded like prayer. The punt driver asked if you needed help. You said: "I AM the help."

*

The thing about loving you is that it's not addition—it's multiplication. Every moment splits into infinite versions: the one that happened, the ones we imagined, the ones still happening in parallel universes where we're different but still this exact same amount of destroyed.

*

You know what terrifies me? Not losing you—that's too simple. What terrifies me is that you've made me infinite in a finite body. You've taught me to feel in dimensions I don't have organs for. I'm running software my hardware can't support. I'm going to crash spectacularly. The error message will just be your name, repeated in every font.

*

Shenzhen, your mother's kitchen: She asked about my "prospects" while cutting vegetables with surgical precision. You translated it as "she likes your shirt." But I understood. Her Mandarin carved questions like scalpels. You stood between us, rewriting our conversation in real-time, a living compiler turning skepticism into acceptance, tradition into possibility. Your mother knew. She smiled anyway. That's when I learned: love isn't just choosing each other. It's everyone else choosing to let you.

*

I need to tell you about last Tuesday. You were debugging, talking to your screen like it betrayed you personally. "You absolute walnut of a function," you said. "You catastrophic disappointment of a loop." I realized: this is how you love. Aggressively. With specificity. With forgiveness built into the fury. You've been calling me a catastrophic disappointment for three years. It's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

Statistical analysis of us:
- Number of times we've said goodbye: 0
- Number of times we've said "see you later" while crying in airports: 47
- Correlation between your happiness and my oxygen levels: 0.97
- Number of seconds I can go without thinking of you: still calculating... stack overflow
- Probability this letter makes you cry: 1.00
- Probability you're already crying: 1.00
- Probability I planned that: 0.00 (your emotions have their own weather system)

Here's my confession: I practice loving you like it's cardiovascular exercise. Sets and reps. Progressive overload. Each day adding more weight. Not because love requires practice, but because my capacity needs expanding. You keep growing. My architecture needs continuous refactoring just to hold the current version of you, let alone the you that's coming, the you that will exist tomorrow, the you that's already happened but I haven't met yet.

*

The Portuguese have "saudade"—missing something that never existed. But we need a word for the opposite: having something so impossible that its existence feels like missing. That's you. You're here and I miss you. You're touching me and I'm homesick for your skin. We're together and I'm nostalgic for right now.

*

Remember Scotland? That inn where the heating died? We wore every piece of clothing we owned simultaneously. You looked like a textile explosion. We played "the floor is actual ice" because it was. You said: "If we die here, they'll find us and think we were one very lumpy person." Then you kissed me and my brain forgot what cold meant. Forgot what separate meant. Forgot everything except the specific frequency of your breathing.

*

So here's what I'm saying—no, here's what I'm proving:

You're not my other half. You're my quantum entanglement. Change my spin and yours changes instantly, regardless of distance. Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance" but he never met you. Never saw how you know I'm sad before I do. Never witnessed you ordering my coffee in cities I haven't reached yet.

*

I want to grow old with you. Want to watch your hair turn silver and still see you emerging from the Cam, furious and perfect. Want to be ninety and still discovering new ways you pronounce "specificity." Want our last words to be our first words, spoken simultaneously: "Is this seat taken?" (It always was. By you. Even before we met.)

*

You're closing your laptop now. Coming over here. Going to read this over my shoulder and say "You absolute walnut" with tears in your voice. Going to kiss me like punctuation. Like you're ending one sentence and starting another. Like we're a run-on sentence that grammarians hate but poets understand.

*

I love you, Leyi. In this universe where we're possible. In the universes where we're not. In the space between heartbeats. In the pause between words. In the specific way Wednesday becomes Thursday when you're sleeping. In the general way time stops mattering when you laugh.

*

I love you like code loves execution—meaningless without you, purposeful because of you.

Warren
(who just realized this letter is a while(true) loop and I'm never getting out and that's the whole point)

P.S. — That lamp from Morocco? It works now. You fixed it with a hairpin and pure spite. It illuminates nothing properly and everything perfectly. Like us.

P.P.S. — You're crying. You're smiling. You're saying my name in all sixteen colors. This is my favorite bug—when your emotions overflow their container and spill into mine. We're memory leaking into each other. Don't patch it. Let us crash together.

P.P.P.S. — Come here. The letter's over but we're not. We're never over. We're just beginning, again and again, like a loop with no exit condition except the heat death of the universe, and even then, I think we'd find a way.
