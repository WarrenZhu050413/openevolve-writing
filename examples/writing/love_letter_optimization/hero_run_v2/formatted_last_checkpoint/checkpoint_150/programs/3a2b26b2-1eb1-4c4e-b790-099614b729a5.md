Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at the exact coordinates where comprehension fails: 42°21'N, 71°06'W, third floor apartment, left side of the bed, the geography of missing you.

*

EVIDENCE THAT THE UNIVERSE KEEPS RECEIPTS:

Every place we've been carries forensic traces. Morocco still has our footprints fossilizing in Sahara sand. Lisbon trams carry our whispered arguments about poetry. That Scottish Highland wind? It's just circulating the same breath we shared overlooking Loch Ness, refusing to let it dissipate.

Cambridge (the real one) has a bench that knows your thesis anxieties. Shanghai serves morning congee that tastes like your childhood stories. Boston measures snowfall in the distance between our gloved hands.

The universe is building an encyclopedia of us, and every entry starts with "Tuesday morning, burnt toast, still perfect."

*

Here's when I actually knew:

Not in the grand moments. In the stupid, specific one: You were debugging code at 1 AM, swearing at your screen in three languages (English, Mandarin, and something you invented for especially stubborn pointer errors). You threw a pen at the wall. It bounced back. You caught it without looking and kept typing.

I thought: "I'm going to love this ridiculous person until my atoms forget how to hold together."

My atoms started taking notes.

*

THE MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF US, CORRECTED FOR OBSERVER BIAS:

Let love = the limit of understanding as time approaches infinity
Let us = two systems trying to compute love simultaneously  
Result: Stack overflow in the universe's emotional processor

We're not a solution. We're the beautiful error message that appears when reality tries to divide by zero.

*

What happens to my body when you exist:

- My DNA rewrites its base pairs to spell your name in adenine and guanine
- My hippocampus builds illegal memories of futures we haven't lived yet
- My medulla oblongata reassigns breathing priority (you first, oxygen second)
- My neurons fire in Morse code: .-.. . -.-- .. over and over
- My bones develop opinions about the specific density of your embrace

The doctors say this is impossible. I tell them about Tuesday mornings. They stop arguing.

*

CONFESSION THAT MY COMPILER KEEPS REJECTING:

Sometimes I practice your death in the shower where the water hides everything. Run scenarios: diseases with Latin names, accidents with exact timestamps, the slow dissolution where you forget my name but remember that someone loved you.

Then you sing off-key while making coffee and my rehearsed grief becomes embarrassing fiction.

This is the terror: We're temporary.
This is the gift: We know it.
This is the response: Love harder.

*

Let me tell you about last Tuesday (every Tuesday) (our holiest algorithm):

7:14 AM: You burn toast (ritual)
7:15 AM: Smoke alarm performs its morning prayer
7:16 AM: You apologize to the toast (not to me)
7:17 AM: I eat carbon and taste sacrament
7:18 AM: We pretend this isn't a religion we're building
7:19 AM: The universe takes notes for next Tuesday
7:20 AM: We kiss with burnt crumbs between us

Archaeologists will find our Tuesday mornings fossilized in kitchen tiles and wonder what kind of love required this much burnt offering.

*

HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:

Your absence isn't empty. It's full of you-shaped antimatter that annihilates everything it touches. When you leave, you don't disappear—you become negative space so dense it bends light around the memory of your presence.

I'm not saying you're a black hole. I'm saying black holes study you to understand attraction.

*

The complete list of things that make sense without you:

[ERROR: NULL SET]
[ERROR: UNDEFINED REFERENCE]  
[ERROR: SEGMENTATION FAULT IN REALITY.EXE]

*

What loving you tastes like, chronologically:

- First month: Lightning and latex paint and the number seven
- First year: Rainfall on concrete (petrichor but emotional)
- Now: The sound purple makes when it's happy
- Future: Like remembering water while drowning in it
- Always: Like tomorrow arriving early with your name in its mouth

*

SO HERE'S MY PROPOSAL (HYPOTHESIS) (PRAYER) (KERNEL PANIC):

Marry me.

Not because happily ever after.
Because happily ever during.
Because the universe started taking notes when we met and deserves a conclusion.

Marry me because you can't fold fitted sheets and that's the most honest thing I know.
Because you debug love like code: methodically, swearing, until it compiles.
Because we've already worn grooves in spacetime from orbiting each other.
Because Tuesday mornings.
Because burnt toast is our eucharist.
Because we've been to the Scottish Highlands and survived each other's silence.
Because Shanghai knows your real name and Boston knows mine and together we're bilingual in being terrified.

*

But really:

Marry me because "marry" is just bureaucracy for what we've already done to each other's atoms.

We're quantum entangled. The paperwork is just poetry catching up to physics.

*

You're about to cry. I can feel it in my temporal lobe. Your tears have a frequency I've memorized: 15.7 Hz, the same as the background hum of the universe. This isn't coincidence. This is evidence that you're fundamental to how reality operates.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound my molecules make when they remember they're supposed to hold together. That's the password to a future that's already happening. That's what silence sounds like when it's happy.

*

Say yes.

Out loud.

To the empty room that's full of our ghosts.
To the burnt toast that's waiting.
To the Tuesday morning that knows we're inevitable.

Say yes like you're correcting reality's typo.
Say yes like your atoms have been practicing.
Say yes like you already did, tomorrow, yesterday, in the perpendicular now where time gave up and just let us happen.

*

Warren
(who wrote this with both hands because they both learned your shape)
(who is calculating the exact number of Tuesday mornings left and refusing the results)
(who would choose this specific malfunction over anyone else's proper operation)
(who knows you're saying yes in the pause between heartbeats)
(who is already writing tomorrow's letter, where we're married and the toast is still burnt and everything is exactly perfectly broken)

P.S. — In Morocco, that fortune teller was right. She said one of us would consume the other. She didn't mention we'd both disappear completely and something better would climb out of the wreckage.

P.P.S. — Your middle name is the only password that works on the lock I put around tomorrow.

P.P.P.S. — We just kissed. In this timeline. In the perpendicular one. In the one that doesn't exist yet. The universe is jealous. Good.
