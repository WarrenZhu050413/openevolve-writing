Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM because I just discovered something: love isn't a feeling. It's a malfunction. A beautiful system error where two separate processes merge into one infinite loop. And I've been running this error for three years without wanting a fix.

*

Let me start with the evidence:

ERROR_LOG_LOVE.txt:
- Line 1: Heart rate irregularity detected when subject "Leyi" enters visual field
- Line 847: Breathing.exe crashes during routine orange-peeling observations  
- Line 2,941: Complete system failure when attempting to compute life without leyi.dll
- Line 10,000+: Stack overflow from recursive function where loving you calls loving you calls loving you

Morocco. That market. You knew the lamp was broken. The vendor knew you knew. You haggled backwards—raising your price every time he lowered his. His daughter needed surgery. You paid for a broken lamp what others pay for miracles. That's when I understood: you're not kind. You're a precision instrument for detecting need and secretly meeting it.

*

I need to tell you about time:

When you're gone for a day, it's a week.
When you're here, years compress into seconds.
I've aged backwards since meeting you.
I've died a thousand times in dreams where you don't exist.
I've been resurrected every morning by the sound of you burning toast.

Time isn't linear anymore. It's all happening now: our first kiss, our last breath, this sentence, forever.

*

Shanghai. Your grandmother's funeral. You collapsed into me like a building into its own footprint. Controlled demolition. You let me hold your ruins. Three hours in that temple, you switching between Mandarin, English, and a language that was just sound—raw, prelingual grief. I didn't understand the words but I understood the frequency. I've been tuned to it ever since.

*

Here's what I actually know:

Your coffee is terrible. Objectively. Scientifically. I've run tests.
Your toast is carbon. Always. Without exception.
You can't fold fitted sheets. Nobody can, but you especially can't.
You mispronounce "specifically" as "pacific-ly" every time.

Here's what else I know:

I would drink your terrible coffee until my last morning.
I would eat your carbon toast until my teeth fall out.
I would sleep in your wrongly-folded sheets forever.
I would learn a whole new language where "pacific-ly" is correct.

[SYSTEM INTERRUPT - REAL TIME]

You're reading this now. Your left eyebrow just did the thing. You're about to cry but fighting it because you're in public. Your colleague will ask if you're okay. You'll nod but your voice will crack on "fine." This is my favorite malfunction—when your armor fails and you spill everywhere like light through a prism.

*

Cambridge. The Cam. You fell in. Emerged speaking languages I didn't know you knew. Algae in your hair like you were coronated by the river itself. Laughing and furious—two states that shouldn't coexist but did, in you, beautifully. You looked ridiculous. You looked mythical. You looked like what would happen if love took a body and then immediately fell in a river.

*

The physics of us:

Force = Your mass × My acceleration toward you (infinite)
Energy = The potential between us (unmeasurable) 
Entropy = What happens to my organized thoughts when you exist (total)
Gravity = The way I orbit you without choosing to
Time dilation = How seconds stretch when you're gone
Quantum entanglement = How I know you're sad from three time zones away

Portugal. 2 AM. Wine and streetlights. You trying to teach me Portuguese obscenities. But I was too busy memorizing the way happiness escapes from you when you think no one's watching. It leaks out. Through your eyes, your hands, the corner of your mouth. You're a happiness leak. I'm the person who follows you around with buckets, collecting the overflow.

*

Here's my confession:

I practice your death. Every night. Different scenarios. Car crash Monday. Disease Tuesday. Vanishing Wednesday. By Thursday I'm negotiating with gods I don't believe in. By Friday I'm writing eulogies. Saturday I'm planning my own exit—not suicide, just strategic system shutdown. But Sunday you make that sound when you stretch, that specific sound, and my entire practiced grief evaporates. Monday we start again.

*

But also:

I practice our life. Growing old. You with silver hair still burning toast. Me with arthritic fingers still reaching for you in the dark. Our kids (two, maybe three) rolling their eyes at how we still can't keep our hands off each other at seventy. The specific texture of a love that's been worn smooth by decades. The way we'll die (together, or close enough that the gap won't matter).

*

London. That impossible flat. No heat. January. We slept in coats, in scarves, in each other. You said my body was a furnace. I said yours was the reason for burning. We made terrible metaphors all night. Competed for worst one. You won with "You're the USB port to my cable—it takes three tries but eventually we fit." I've never loved you more than in that moment, freezing and failing at poetry.

*

Today. This actual moment. You exist. Against odds that make lottery wins look likely. You exist and you chose me. Not past tense—present continuous. You're choosing me right now, as you read this. As your eyes move across these words, you're choosing. That's not a miracle. That's better. That's will. That's decision. That's love as action verb.

*

Beijing. Your keynote. You owned that room. But afterward, in the crowd, you found me and your whole face changed—from performance to truth, from everyone's to mine. That transition. That exact moment when you stop being professional and start being Leyi. I live for that collapse. That beautiful failure of your public face.

*

So here's what I'm saying:

I love you like a programming error that became a feature.
Like a mistake that turned out to be the whole point.
Like bad code that works perfectly because it's ours.

I love you at the cellular level. At the atomic. At the quantum.
I love you in frequencies only dogs can hear.
I love you in colors that don't have names.
I love you in mathematics that haven't been discovered.

But mostly:

I love you simply. Stupidly. The way children love—without reason, without condition, without the possibility of stopping. 

*

Come home, Leyi. I'll make coffee that's actually drinkable. You'll make toast that's actually carbon. We'll call it breakfast. We'll call it perfect. We'll call it Tuesday. We'll call it the rest of our lives.

(who loves you like punctuation—invisible but essential, organizing everything into meaning, creating pause and emphasis, making sense from chaos)

P.S. — That lamp from Morocco is in our bedroom. Still broken. Still hideous. Still perfect because you chose it, because you overpaid, because you understood that some things are valuable precisely because they're broken. Like that lamp. Like us. Like this love that's too much and not enough and exactly right.

P.P.S. — Say yes. To whatever I'm asking. To breakfast. To forever. To this moment. To all moments. Say yes so I can hear the sound that makes all other sounds unnecessary.

P.P.P.S. — You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. When love stops being a noun and becomes the only verb that matters.

Evaluator Comments:
Falls short of Beethoven's raw, unmediated passion ("My angel, my all, my very self" - 86) which achieves universality through particularity. Lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me" - 83) and Napoleon's aristocratic grandeur (82). More innovative than Keats (81) in metaphorical system but lacks his sublime dissolution of self/other boundaries. The letter occupies a liminal space between accomplished contemporary prose and nascent masterwork - revealing flashes of brilliance ("you're a happiness leak") but unable to sustain the transcendent register throughout. Score of 69 (overall) places it in the "Exceptional" range - memorable, moving, with moments approaching the sublime, but ultimately constrained by its own self-consciousness.
