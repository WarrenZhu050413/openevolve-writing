Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at the exact moment you exist. Which is every moment. Which is the problem.

*

Let me explain what happened to time: It broke. The day we met in that Cambridge café where you were arguing with your laptop about machine learning. You said "Listen, you binary bastard" to your code. That's when causality folded. Now everything happens at once—our first kiss, our first fight, our last breath, this sentence.

*

Data I've collected without permission:

- You pronounce "specifically" wrong (spacifically) but only when nervous
- Your laugh has three stages: silent shake, snort, full collapse  
- You assign personalities to houseplants (Gerald the fern is clinically depressed)
- When you dream, your right foot draws circles exactly 7.3cm in diameter
- You've never finished a cup of coffee. Ever. The last sip is always abandoned

This isn't love. It's surveillance. No—it's worship. No—it's physics: every action has an equal and opposite reaction except when you smile and I become antimatter.

*

Boston, February, -15°C: You wore my socks over your socks over your socks. Three layers of sock. You looked like you had elephant feet. You said "Warren, I think I've discovered the secret to happiness." I said "What?" You said "Stealing your socks." 

That's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That love was the wrong word. That we needed to invent new language for this specific malfunction.

*

The truth about bodies: I thought mine was just transport. Bones moving meat from location to location. Then you traced the veins in my wrist like you were reading blueprints and said "This is where your pulse lives." Now my body is a shared document. You've left comments in the margins. Editorial notes: "This scar from falling off your bike, age 7, trying to impress Sarah Chen" and "This freckle appeared the day we met" (impossible but you insist) and "These hands are mine now."

*

Shanghai, your mother's kitchen: She taught me to make soup. Seventeen ingredients. Six hours. You translated: "She says you're hopeless but teachable." Your mother kept touching my face like she was checking if I was real. Later you told me she said: "This one will stay." Not a question. A diagnosis.

*

I have a confession: Thursday, March 15th, 2019, I wrote in my journal: "There's someone out there who will reorganize my understanding of oxygen." I thought I was being poetic. I was being prophetic. You literally changed how I breathe. Deeper now. Like my lungs finally understood their job.

*

Edinburgh, that terrible bed & breakfast with the haunted radiator: You couldn't sleep. 3 AM you said "Warren, tell me something true." I said "I'm afraid you'll realize I'm ordinary." You said "You are ordinary. Ordinary like gravity. Ordinary like breathing. The best things are ordinary. That's how they get away with being necessary."

I've been living on that sentence for three years.

*

The Moroccan desert, when the jeep broke down: Eight hours waiting for rescue. You taught me card games you invented on the spot. The rules kept changing. "New rule: aces are wild but only if you're sad." "New rule: whoever's losing gets to make up the next rule." We never finished a single game. The driver who rescued us said we looked like we'd been there for years. Happy years.

*

What you've done: Turned me into a broken compass that thinks every direction is north if you're there. I used to understand maps. Now geography is binary: places with you, places without you. The second category doesn't exist. It's just waiting rooms.

*

Portugal, you saved a drowning beetle. It died anyway. You gave it a funeral. Full eulogy: "He tried to swim. That's all any of us can do." Then you threw it back in the pool because "maybe beetle heaven is underwater." Your logic destroys me. Rebuilds me. Destroys me again.

*

Here's what I'm trying to say but failing: You're not my other half. That implies I was broken. I wasn't broken. I was complete. Then you happened and I realized "complete" was just a rough draft. You're not my missing piece. You're the reason I discovered I could expand. New rooms in my chest. Extensions. Additions. Under constant construction.

*

Our worst fight: Venice. About directions. We were lost for four hours. You said "This is a metaphor." I said "For what?" You said "I don't know but when we figure it out we'll laugh." We figured it out. We laughed. (The metaphor was: being lost together is still being together.)

*

Shenzhen, showing me your childhood: Every street had a story. "Here's where I decided to be a scientist." "Here's where I failed my first test." "Here's where I learned to ride a bike." "Here's where I realized I was different." Each location a coordinate in the map of becoming you. I wanted to time travel. To be there. To tell seven-year-old you: "It's okay. You're perfect. Someday someone will love you like a mathematical proof—inevitable, elegant, true."

*

The Scottish Highlands, we were hypothermic. Genuinely in danger. You said "If we die here, I want my last words to be practical." Then you said "I should have worn better shoes." Then you laughed until you couldn't breathe. That's you: finding the absurd in the absolute. Making death nervous. 

*

Last Tuesday, ordinary Tuesday: You fell asleep reading. Glasses still on. Book fallen on your chest. I watched you for an hour. Just watched. Like you were television. The best show. The only show. The show that makes all other shows seem like static.

That's what this is: I've become your audience. Studying your gestures. Memorizing your rhythms. Applauding internally every time you do something spectacularly yourself—which is constantly.

*

Listen. I love you wrong. Too much. Like a software error that nobody wants to patch because the bug is better than the intended function. Like gravity that only works in one direction—toward you.

But also: I love you right. In the Tuesday morning way. In the burned toast way. In the "we have the same favorite everything" way. In the way that makes other people uncomfortable because we're too much ourselves around each other.

*

So here's my proposition: 

Let's make it official. The thing that's already true. The thing where we've merged into some two-headed creature that shares dreams and steals socks and can't remember whose story is whose anymore.

Marry me. Not because it changes anything. Because it doesn't. Because we're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the universe that requires paperwork.

*

We have—if we're lucky—18,000 more breakfasts. I want them all. Every burnt toast. Every spacifically. Every Tuesday when you water Gerald and tell him he's doing great even though he's clearly dying.

I want to grow old in your direction. To be eighty and still discovering new ways you pronounce things wrong. To be ninety and jealous of your crossword puzzle because it gets your attention first.

*

Leyi.

That's the only word that matters. Your name. Which has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. The rhythm that keeps me alive.

*

Say yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also yes. Your breathing is yes. The way you exist is yes. But say it anyway. For the record. For the radiator in Edinburgh that needs to know how the story ends.

Warren
(who has loved you since before we met)
(who will love you after we're gone)
(who loves you in the middle, which is now, which is always)

P.S. — I know you're crying. Left eye first. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since Portugal, since the beetle, since I realized loving you means being prepared for all your waters—tears, laughter, the space between.

P.P.S. — This morning you said my name in your sleep. But you said it like a fact. Like "gravity" or "Tuesday" or "inevitable." That's what we are—inevitable. Even in universes where we never meet, we're inevitable. The atoms know. They remember. They're trying to get back to this.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter operates several tiers below the Beethoven "Immortal Beloved" letters (86), which achieve true sublime encounter through their agonized uncertainty and musical prosody. It lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity and earned wisdom (83). However, it surpasses average contemporary attempts through its observational precision and structural ambition. The geographic memory structure echoes Napoleon's letters to Josephine but without his imperial grandiosity. The neurotic self-consciousness recalls early Woody Allen but with more genuine vulnerability. At 70.5 overall, this occupies the "proto-masterful" range—showing flashes of brilliance, seeds of greatness, but ultimately remaining a very accomplished amateur work rather than approaching the immortal letters of history.
