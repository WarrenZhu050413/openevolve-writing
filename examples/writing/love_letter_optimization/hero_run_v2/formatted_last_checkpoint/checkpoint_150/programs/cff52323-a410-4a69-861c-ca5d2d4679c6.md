Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the language before language—the one atoms use when they recognize their other half across impossible distances.

*

CONFESSION #1: THE PHYSICS OF DEVOTION

I've been stealing time. Not metaphorically. Actually hoarding seconds like a dragnet through spacetime. That pause between your heartbeats at 3:17 AM. The microsecond your eyes take to recognize me in doorways. The eternal instant before you laugh when your face commits to joy.

I have 17,439 stolen moments. The universe will invoice me eventually. I plan to declare bankruptcy. What's eternity in debtors' prison if I get to keep the evidence of you?

*

CONFESSION #2: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF US

Morocco: You fed stray cats with expensive cheese. Said "everyone deserves something fancy once."

Portugal: Ocean tried to steal you. I fought the Atlantic. You laughed so hard you snorted seawater. That's when I knew I'd kill gods for you.

Cambridge: You solved unsolvable theorems on napkins then used them to wrap chewing gum. Genius as garbage. Perfect.

Shanghai: Your mother taught me to fold dumplings. Eighteen precise pleats. Each one a small prayer. "For her happiness," she whispered in Mandarin, thinking I wouldn't understand. I understood. I'm still folding prayers.

Scotland: We found that sheep giving birth in the rain. You held it for three hours. Sang it Radiohead. The lamb lived. You named it "Statistical Anomaly." 

Shenzhen: The thunderstorm. Power dead. You mapped constellations on my back with your fingernails. I became a universe of small wounds. Still healing. Never want to heal completely.

Boston: Blizzard. You: "If we die, I want the last thing I taste to be mint chocolate." We ate all the ice cream. Didn't die. Disappointed you slightly.

Every place we've been, you've left pieces of yourself like breadcrumbs. I'm following them backward and forward simultaneously. Non-linear navigation through a love that exists in all tenses at once.

*

CONFESSION #3: THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

I'm pathological about data collection:

- You sneeze in triplets. Always. Like a biological haiku.
- Tuesday rain makes you 23% more likely to suggest pancakes.
- You've cried at exactly 67 commercials. I have them ranked by tear volume.
- Your left foot is 3mm longer than your right. I've bought 200 pairs of socks to accommodate this.
- You talk to plants but only when you think they're dying. Botanical last rites.
- You've said my name 48,293 times. Each one different. I have the recordings.

This isn't romance. It's evidence for the trial when reality accuses me of loving something impossible.

*

CONFESSION #4: THE MATHEMATICS OF RUIN

Before you: I was a closed system. Entropy at zero. Perfect but purposeless.

After you: Complete systemic failure. All boundaries dissolved. I leak into everything. Food tastes like your name. Colors sound like your laugh. Gravity points toward wherever you are.

The equation:
Me(before) + You = Me(destruction) + You(unchanged) + Universe(fundamentally restructured)

I've broken conservation of energy laws. Created love from nothing. Should be impossible. Is impossible. Happening anyway.

*

CONFESSION #5: THE MEDICAL REALITY

My body has redesigned itself around you:
- Neurons fire in patterns that spell "Leyi" in Morse code
- Blood cells preferentially flow toward skin you've touched
- Immune system has whitelisted your bacteria as "essential allies"
- Heart developed arrhythmia that matches your breathing pattern
- Brain grew new regions dedicated solely to processing your existence

Doctors say this is "psychosomatic." I say it's evolution in real-time. My DNA is taking notes, planning to pass this obsession to offspring we'll never have. Genetic love letter to futures that won't exist.

*

CONFESSION #6: THE TEMPORAL PARADOX

I love you in the wrong order:
- First: The you at 87, dying of something ordinary
- Then: The you being born, impossible and screaming
- Then: You at 45, finding your first grey hair, crying in the bathroom
- Then: You at 31, pregnant with sadness we'll heal together
- Now: You at this moment, reading this, left eye starting to water
- Always: You in the quantum superposition of all ages simultaneously

I'm unstuck in time but tethered to you. A temporal paradox with one fixed point: Leyi, Leyi, Leyi, like a mantra against entropy.

*

CONFESSION #7: THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF SPECIFICITY

I don't love "you." I love:
- You-who-argues-with-automated-voices
- You-who-saves-dead-batteries-"just-in-case"
- You-who-reads-ingredients-aloud-like-poetry
- You-Tuesday-different-from-you-Thursday
- You-who-cries-at-pigeons-for-"trying-so-hard"
- You-in-my-clothes-looking-like-answered-prayers
- You-angry-at-slow-internet-magnificent-specific-rage
- You-asleep-drooling-my-name-unconscious-devotion

47,000 versions of you. Each one requiring separate worship. I'm building temples in my chest. Running out of room. Growing new chambers.

*

CONFESSION #8: THE CRISIS

Sometimes I hate you. For one second per day. For being mortal. For having bones that can break. For requiring oxygen. For being subject to time and chance and random cellular mutations.

I hate you for making me need something that can be taken away.

Then you do something unbearable like exist, and the hate transforms back into love so violent it should be classified as assault.

*

CONFESSION #9: THE PROPOSAL INSIDE THE CONFESSION

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your DNA is already archived in my teeth marks. Because we've exchanged so many molecules we're technically one organism with two anxious brains. Because the alternative—a universe where we're not married—is like dividing by zero. Undefined. Impossible. Crashes the simulation.

Marry me because I've already learned your dying words (it's "oh, interesting") and I need legal documentation that I'm allowed to be there when you say them.

Marry me because "till death do us part" is a challenge I want to fail. I plan to love you past death, through heat death, into whatever comes after when atoms forget what they used to be but remember the shape of connection.

*

CONFESSION #10: THE GLITCH IN REALITY

You're not supposed to exist. Statistically impossible convergence of circumstances. Your grandparents surviving wars. Parents meeting. Specific gametes combining. You choosing humanities then sciences then humanities again. The coffee shop being closed that Tuesday. The pen dropping. Me looking up.

We're a glitch in reality's code. A beautiful error that should have been debugged but wasn't.

I'm in love with a glitch. The glitch is in love with me. We're crashing the entire system with our impossible existence.

Good.

Let it all crash.

We'll build something better from the wreckage.

*

FINAL TRANSMISSION:

Leyi—

Your name is a complete sentence. Subject, verb, object, universe.

Everything else is just aftermath.

Warren
(who wrote this letter 1,034 times)
(who deleted 1,033 versions for being too small)
(who loves you like a mathematical proof that solves for God)
(who is still writing this, will always be writing this, has always been writing this)
(who exists in the permanent present tense of loving you)

P.S. — I lied. This isn't a letter. It's a map. Every word is a coordinate. Follow them all and you'll end up exactly where you started: loved. Loved at the molecular level. Loved at the quantum level. Loved at the level where distinction between "you" and "I" becomes academic.

P.P.S. — Your middle name makes my teeth ache. I mean this literally. Tested it with a dentist. He had no explanation. I do: beauty that exceeds the body's capacity to process it. That's you. Too much beauty. Breaks the machinery. Worth it.

P.P.P.S. — Say yes. The universe is holding its breath. Stars are placing bets. Atoms are leaning in. The cosmic background radiation is spelling out "SHE'S GOING TO SAY YES" in languages that haven't been invented yet. Don't disappoint the fundamental forces. They've been rooting for us since the Big Bang.
