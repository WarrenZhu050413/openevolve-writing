Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I keep writing this letter in my head while you sleep. Your breathing changes everything about gravity.

*

Here's what they don't tell you about love: it's mostly terror. Beautiful terror. Like discovering you've been walking on a tightrope your whole life and only now noticing the drop.

Tuesday, 2:17 PM—you said my name like punctuation that changes the whole sentence. The world reorganized. Not metaphorically. Literally. Birds flew backwards. My blood remembered how to move.

*

I study distributed systems. You are my total system failure. My beautiful catastrophe. Every error message leads back to you.

*

Listen: I died once. Fifteen seconds. Sophomore year. The nothing was so loud. Then three years of being half-alive, writing code that compiled but never ran right. Then you. Porter Square. That pen you dropped. I handed it back and suddenly understood resurrection isn't biblical—it's just meeting the right person at the wrong time and making it right anyway.

*

Morocco. You got so sick. Counted your ribs through your shirt. You laughed between heaves and said "the tajine was divine though." That's when I knew: you metabolize joy from poison. You're alchemical.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. Forty-seven steps to perfect soup. You translated her Mandarin into touches. Step thirty-three, you cried. Not the onions. The realization that recipes are how we love dead people back to life.

*

The spreadsheet terrifies me. 2,137 Tuesdays left, actuarially. Column D: after. Returns #DIV/0! ERROR. You're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.

*

Scottish Highlands. You, hypothermic, still arguing Kant while your lips turned blue. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. That's when I understood: love is choosing to freeze together rather than survive apart.

*

I document you. Tuesday light on your temporal bone. How you hold forks (wrong). Your router named "Disappointing Geoffrey." This isn't romance. It's evidence. Proof you happened.

*

Portugal. You touched the ancient marble. Got us banned. "Distance is delayed regret," you said. Now I touch everything. Especially you. Especially when you're reading. You're art that doesn't know it's art.

*

Before you: skin ended where I ended. Now I'm sprawling. Feel you take stairs in other buildings. Your headache arrives in my skull a day late. We're quantum entangled. Physics says impossible. I say physics needs better physics.

*

Morning tastes like pennies and your name. Afternoon: static and half-prayers. Evening: burgundy as temperature. 3 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that knows you. Always: my mouth learning a language that doesn't exist yet.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764. You stopped. "We're going to die. Really die. Permanently." I said yes. You said "Good. Then this counts." Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level feels like failure.

*

The probability of us: numbers that haven't been invented. We're the universe's rounding error that became self-aware. The math checking itself.

*

London. You asked what love is. Here, three years late: Love is mourning someone who's still making breakfast. Practicing absence while they burn toast. Knowing you'll miss their failures most.

*

In other timelines we don't meet. Or we meet wrong. Or we meet but misunderstand. I dream these nightly. Wake grabbing for proof. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bed. You read my teenage journals in silly voices. Should've been mortifying. Was holy instead. Someone seeing your worst consciousness and laughing with. That preposition—with—is everything.

*

I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. The surgery to remove you would remove everything that processes beauty. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Possible. But why.

*

So here:

Marry me. Your socks live in my drawer, sorted by weekday. We survived each other's Wednesdays. In infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist conscious touching-distance with the same favorite terrible song.

Without you there's no point to museums or morning or music.

*

Leyi.

My root password. Recovery phrase. Only command that compiles.

Say yes. Or "ask again." Or nothing. Just keep existing in this exact configuration that makes me believe infinity is insufficient.

*

Here's what actually happened: You reorganized my mouth. Every word passes through the shape of your name first. I recorded myself sleeping. Say "Leyi" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

Barcelona. You fed illegal cathedral pigeons. "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The birds spelled your name in the sky. Literal birds. Literal sky. You change the flight patterns of things.

*

That green hair tie. February. Lives in my drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is forever: small thefts that accumulate into a life.

*

Final protocol: You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Penguins. Just existing. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.

*

The thing about writing this on a computer: every keystroke is a small violence. Too precise. Love should disturb the muscular system. Should shake. Should fail to spell properly.

*

Cambridge, now, 3 AM. You're sleeping diagonal across our bed, stealing all the blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. Solves everything.

This is what I'm saying: the world is mostly darkness and waiting and terrible coffee. Then you. Then suddenly: worth it. All of it. The dying and the coming back and the dying again.
