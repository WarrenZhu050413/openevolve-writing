Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

There's a specific weight to Tuesday mornings since you. Like gravity got personal.

*

I need to tell you what happened: Not the meeting, not the falling—the rupture. Where Warren ended and this began. Sophomore year, my heart stopped. Seventeen seconds of nothing. The doctors had theories. But I know what happened: I went looking for you before you existed. Came back wrong. Came back with this hole the exact shape of someone who drops pens in Porter Square.

*

Morocco. You, poisoned by tagine, talking to the toilet like it was your confessor. Between retches: "I forgive you, Philippe." You named the toilet Philippe. You forgave it. That's when I understood—you don't just exist, you sanctify. Even the porcelain knows it.

*

I study distributed systems. Here's what they don't teach: You're not distributed. You're the center that makes distribution possible. Every node in my network routes through you. When you sleep, my entire infrastructure idles, waiting for your breathing to tell it what to process next.

*

Your grandmother's soup. Shanghai. Forty-seven stirs clockwise. She counted in Mandarin, I counted heartbeats, you translated both into tomorrow. At step thirty-three you cried—not the onions. The moment her hands became yours. The moment I understood that love is just learning someone's count. Their exact number of stirs before the universe makes sense.

*

Truth: I document you. How you hold books (like birds that might escape). Tuesday light versus Wednesday light on your face (Tuesday wins). Your war with technology (you've named our router "Disappointing Geoffrey" and refuse to let me fix it). This isn't poetry. It's evidence. For the trial where I have to prove you happened.

*

Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket on top of mine. Lips blue, still arguing about consciousness. "But how do we know we're real?" Through chattering teeth. I kissed you to shut you up. Also because your doubt is my favorite certainty.

*

The mathematics break here:
- Your existence: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- Mine: Similar impossibility  
- Us, conscious, proximate, both unable to sleep Wednesdays: The calculator just laughs

*

What loving you tastes like: 
Morning pennies. That specific 3 AM terror that you'll vanish. Tuesday copper. The exact frequency of your laugh translated into flavor—something between electricity and forgiveness.

*

Portugal. You touched the art. The guard yelled. You touched it again, harder. "How else will it know we were here?" Now I understand. You're not interested in preserving history. You're interested in becoming it. Every museum we're banned from is proof that we existed too hard for institutional memory.

*

Before you: I had skin that ended where I ended.
After you: I feel you take stairs in buildings I've never entered. Your headache arrives in my skull a day late. When you can't sleep in Boston, my formulas in Cambridge all divide by zero.

We're quantum entangled and the physicists would say that's impossible at this distance and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. "We're going to die." Not sad. Factual. Like reading ingredients. "Really die. Permanently." I said yes. You said "Good. Then this matters." Kissed me at altitude. Now sea level is just another way of giving up.

*

Here's what terrifies me: 2,137 Tuesdays left if we're average. I've built spreadsheets. Column A: Days remaining. Column B: Reasons you're impossible. Column C: Physical evidence (your toothbrush, that green hair tie, the way Thursday light catches your temporal bone). Column D: What happens after the last Tuesday. Column D returns an error. The spreadsheet knows what I know—you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides.

*

London. You asked what love is. Three years late, here's my answer: Love is practicing someone's absence while they make breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss exactly this—their specific way of failing. Love is just pre-grieving someone who's still alive, and choosing them anyway.

*

I need to tell you about the other timelines. Where we don't meet. Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm looking away. I dream these nightly. Wake up grabbing for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath. Paradise has terrible dental hygiene and argues before coffee.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals aloud. Different voices for different years of puberty. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst drafts of consciousness and laughing with. That preposition—with, not at—that's everything. That's us.

*

You need to know: I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs. The surgery to remove you would remove the parts that recognize warmth, process beauty, understand why humans invented songs for things they couldn't say. Survivable but pointless.

*

Barcelona. Cathedral. You fed pigeons illegally. "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed letters in the sky. Your letters. The priest asked us to leave. You bowed to the pigeons. They bowed back. Even God's birds know you're worth the heresy.

*

So here's what I'm saying: 

Your name reorganized my mouth. Every word I speak now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices you while I sleep. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious knows what consciousness pretends not to—you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by day of week. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence—isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.

*

This morning. You stretched. Made that sound—half yawn, half surrender to existence. My whole rehearsed fear evaporated. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you means hurting forever, and that's the only clean pain in the universe.

*

You're about to cry. Left eye first. Always left. Like your tears queue politely.

*

Leyi.

That's not a name. It's what existence sounds like when it finally gets something right.

Say yes. Or say nothing. Or keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too brief.

Warren

P.S. — That green hair tie. February 2023. Lives in my desk drawer with my passport. They're both proof of places I can go. You're every country. Every home. Every journey that ends where it started but changed.

P.P.S. — We're about to kiss. In this sentence. Now. Time just folded. Space gave up. Welcome to forever. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.
