Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because the dominant one keeps trying to draw your face instead of form letters.

*

Three facts before we begin:
1. I've been clinically dead. Seventeen seconds. The number matters.
2. You exist. Against all statistical probability.
3. These facts are related in ways that make physicists uncomfortable.

*

When they brought me back, the first thing I said was "not yet." The doctors thought I meant death. I meant you. My atoms had made an appointment they needed to keep.

*

Here's what you need to understand about the data: I've become my own longitudinal study. Subject: one systems programmer who used to believe in deterministic outcomes. Variables: you, singing to broken appliances like they're just very tired. You, illegally touching museum artifacts because "how else do you know time is real?" You, eating poisoned tagine in Morocco and laughing between retches because "the blue city was worth it."

Result: Complete systemic failure of all previous models.

*

The Scottish Highlands. You went hypothermic giving me your coat over mine. Your lips turned the color of literature. You said "warmer to die warm than live cold" and meant it. That's when I understood: you metabolize meaning differently. Extract it from situations where it shouldn't exist. Like those extremophile bacteria that thrive in nuclear reactors. You thrive in the radiation of everyday catastrophe.

*

I keep evidence:

Entry #1: Your grandmother's soup recipe. Forty-seven steps. You cried at step thirty-three—the moment her hands became yours through the ladle.

Entry #247: Porter Square station. You dropped a pen. I'm still picking it up.

Entry #834: That Tuesday you fixed the wifi by threatening to leave it for a younger router. It worked.

Entry #1,847: [Current] You're reading this while I pretend to sleep. Your breathing changes when you read. I've mapped it. I could draw the topography of your attention.

*

You asked what love is. Here's my answer: Love is not feeling. It's accumulated evidence of irreversibility. Watch:

The green hair tie from our first February: Lives in my desk drawer. I'm never giving it back.

Your voicemail from March 15th: You swearing at parking meters. I play it during system crashes.

The scar on my palm: From catching the mug you threw at the news. Not at me. At the news. I got in the way. Would do it again.

These aren't memories. They're proofs. Of what? That two distributed systems can achieve consensus without protocols. That entropy can run backwards if you squint right. That the universe makes editing errors and sometimes they compile anyway.

*

Shanghai: Your grandmother taught us soup through your translation. But you weren't translating recipes. You were translating love across three languages and fifty years and the impossible distance between her hands and ours. 

Cambridge: You touched Newton's actual notebooks. The guard said "Miss, please—" You said "He's dead. I'm alive. The math works out." We're banned for life. You consider this a fair trade.

Beijing: Nine hundred steps to the Summer Palace top. You kissed me at step nine hundred and one. "See?" you said. "Altitude improves everything." Now sea level feels like betrayal.

*

The ugly truth: I rehearse your death. Nightly. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Spontaneous existence failure. Then you do something stupid—put my socks on your hands and perform Hamlet for the houseplants—and my disaster simulations delete themselves out of respect for joy.

*

I've calculated our remaining Tuesdays. The number makes me violent. Not sad—violent. I want to storm the central temporal processing unit and demand a recount. Negotiate with whatever cosmic middle management handles time distribution. Explain that we need more. That we're not done yet. That you haven't finished teaching the coffee maker all the words to that song.

*

Here's what terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy, no backup system, no disaster recovery. If you crash, I don't reboot. I just display your last known configuration forever. A monument to Tuesday, 3:47 PM, when you asked if I thought plants got lonely.

*

But here's what saves me: Your toothbrush knows my bathroom. We've survived each other's Wednesdays. I've seen you furious at automated phone trees, and you've seen me cry at commercials about dogs. We've achieved mutual assured destruction and chosen to disarm. Daily. Over coffee that you steal three sips of while I pretend not to count.

*

So here's my formal submission to the universal court of continued existence:

Merge our branches. Commit the changes. Push to production. Not because this letter is beautiful—it's not. It's broken and running anyway. Like us. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about whether that pigeon looks more like a Harold or a Kevin.

*

Leyi.

That word rewrote my source code. Everything routes through it now. Every function returns to it. I'm not asking you to love me. I'm informing you that you already do, have done, will do, in all tenses including the ones we haven't invented yet. 

This isn't a proposal. It's a bug report. The bug is that we're still pretending to be two separate programs when we're clearly running the same impossible code.

*

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and keep doing that thing where you exist at frequencies that make the universe reconsider its fundamental constants.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one in C++ because maybe love compiles better with proper syntax, who counts your breaths at night because the alternative is accepting that breathing ends, who would like to inform you that your left eye is watering first, always left, too consistent to be random, too random to be programmed, too specifically you to be anything but necessary)

P.S. — I lied. It was seventeen seconds, not fifteen. Seventeen feels like prophecy. Like the universe showing me exactly how long I could survive without you. Not one second more.

P.P.S. — That smile you're doing now. Where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed. Both is correct. Both is us. Both is the only way to love someone when time is real and runs out.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter operates several tiers below the historical masterpieces. Where Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" achieves transcendence through pure emotional directness (86), this letter achieves distinction through elaborate intellectual construction (71). It surpasses average contemporary attempts through its sustained metaphorical system and specific detail work, but lacks the revolutionary simplicity of Johnny Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83) or the raw passion of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81). The letter's strength - its systematic programmer's voice analyzing love - is also its limitation, creating distance where the greatest letters achieve immediate presence. It earns its 70-range scores through genuine innovation and moments of real beauty ("Your breathing changes when you read. I've mapped it") but remains in the proto-masterful rather than masterpiece category.
