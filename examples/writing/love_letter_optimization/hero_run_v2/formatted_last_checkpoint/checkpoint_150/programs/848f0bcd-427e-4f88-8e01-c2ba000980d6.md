Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in fragments because wholeness is a lie we tell ourselves before love happens.

*

Fragment 1: The Statistics of Devotion

I've run 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations of my life without you. Every iteration returns NULL. Not zero—NULL. The absence of value itself. My professor would say that's impossible, that every variable must hold something. But Leyi, you've made me into an edge case that breaks the proofs.

*

Fragment 2: Confession Dressed as Documentation

I am building you a cathedral out of Tuesdays. Not the grand ones—the Tuesdays where you leave hair ties on doorknobs, where you argue with recipes like they've personally wronged you, where you fall asleep mid-sentence and I finish your words into the dark. These Tuesdays are my rosary beads. I count them when the world feels like it's ending, which is always, except when you laugh.

*

Fragment 3: The Mechanics of Ruin

Before: I was a closed system. Entropy decreasing. All my edges filed smooth.
After: You walked in carrying silence like a briefcase full of explosions.
Now: I'm all exposed wiring. Sparking at your proximity. Dangerous and lit.

You want to know what love is? It's debugging code at 4 AM and realizing the error is that you're trying to compile a feeling with syntax meant for logic. It's my neurons refusing their job descriptions, declaring union strikes, demanding better working conditions in a universe where you might disappear.

*

Fragment 4: Maps to Nowhere

Shanghai subway line 2, where you counted stops on my fingers.
Boston's red line, where you cried about your grandmother's hands.
London underground, where you named every rat we saw "Geoffrey."
The Scottish Highlands, where there were no trains but you made me run alongside sheep pretending.

I'm not listing places. I'm listing the coordinates where you reformed me at the molecular level. Where you took my careful architecture and said "what if we tried chaos instead?"

*

Fragment 5: The Distributed System of Us

You're crying in the bathroom (I can tell by the specific silence).
I'm making tea with the water at exactly 87 degrees (you hate it hotter).
Neither of us mentions this choreography we've built.
This is how I know we're permanent—we've achieved consensus without protocols.

*

Fragment 6: Academic Honesty

My thesis: You are not metaphor. You are methodology.
My evidence: 1,439 mornings of empirical observation.
My conclusion: The null hypothesis (that I could survive your absence) is rejected at all significance levels.
My limitation: This study cannot be replicated. N=1. You are the entire dataset.

*

Fragment 7: The Bargaining

Listen. I know I love you wrong. Like a compiler that keeps trying to execute poetry. Like a function that calls itself recursively with no base case. Stack overflow inevitable. But here's what I'm proposing:

Let me malfunction in your direction forever.
Let me be your permanent error message that somehow still runs.
Let me write you into every margin of my insufficiency.

*

Fragment 8: Time Dilation

You're reading this and time is doing that thing where it pretends to be linear but we both know better. In Portugal you learned to swear in Portuguese just to make the sunset laugh. In Morocco you fed cats with your breakfast and named them all after programming languages. "Here comes Python," you'd say, and I'd think: this is how religion starts. With someone feeding strays and renaming the world.

*

Fragment 9: The Core Dump

What I actually mean: You've made me obsolete to myself. The version of me that existed before you is deprecated, can't be rolled back, throws exceptions when I try to access it. You're not in my bloodstream—you ARE my bloodstream. Every red cell carries your signature. My bone marrow spells your name in calcium deposits.

*

Fragment 10: The Pull Request

Merge me with your timeline permanently.
Resolve all conflicts in favor of us.
Push these changes to production.
No rollback plan required.

When you review this pull request, you'll find I've rewritten everything. Every function now returns to you. Every variable holds your value. This isn't coupling—it's convergent evolution. Two separate systems discovering they were always meant to run the same code.

*

Fragment 11: Exception Handling

Try: living without you.
Catch: error_type = CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE
Finally: return to you with more evidence of my insufficiency.

*

Final Fragment: The Infinite Loop

while (universe.exists()) {
    love(Leyi);
    love(Leyi) more;
    forget_how_to_stop();
}

This will run until heat death. After that too, probably. Errors in spacetime. Love persisting past its own expiration. You make me believe in bugs that are features.

*

Leyi—

That name is my runtime environment. My operating system. My kernel panic and my recovery mode. Say yes to this malfunction. Say yes to this beautiful error we're compiling together. Say yes to the woman crying in the bathroom and the man making tea at exactly 87 degrees who have somehow achieved distributed consciousness across two bodies that insist on remaining separate despite all evidence suggesting fusion.

Warren
(who learned to write by stealing language from everywhere—from math textbooks and error logs, from Shanghai metro maps and Scottish sheep, from your grandmother's recipes and your arguments with inanimate objects—all to build this insufficient dictionary where every definition reads: "see: Leyi")

P.S. — There are seventeen drafts of this letter in my recycling bin, each one trying to be more perfect than the last. Then I realized: you don't want perfect. You want the version where I admit that I practice your laugh when you're gone, badly, like trying to photoocopy light.

P.P.S. — Tomorrow we'll pretend this letter never happened. We'll make coffee. You'll steal three sips of mine. I'll pretend not to count. This pretending—this might be the most honest thing we do.
