Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:23 AM. Cambridge. The radiator ticks like a countdown. My hand won't stop shaking—not caffeine, not cold. It's what happens when your entire nervous system reorganizes around someone else's existence.

*

Let me be precise: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, Porter Square station. You dropped that blue Bic pen. I picked it up. Our fingers touched for exactly 0.7 seconds. In that fraction, every neuron I owned switched allegiance. I haven't had an original thought since. Every synapse terminates in your name.

*

I study distributed systems. Consensus protocols. Byzantine failures. But here's my actual research: how you've distributed yourself across every process in my consciousness. You're not a bug in my code—you're the only reason it compiles at all.

*

Confession: I died once. Fifteen seconds, sophomore year. Cardiac arrest during a panic attack. The nothing was deafening. Came back incomplete—a function missing its return statement. Three years of runtime errors. Then you. Then that pen. Then suddenly: stack overflow. Too much life for one body. Had to rewrite my entire architecture to accommodate this much feeling.

*

Morocco. You got so sick I counted your ribs through your shirt. Between heaves, you laughed—actually laughed—and said "but the tajine was transcendent." That's when I knew: you're not built like other humans. You metabolize beauty from poison. You're alchemical.

*

Your grandmother's kitchen, Shanghai. She taught me her soup in forty-seven steps. Counted in Mandarin while you translated through tears. Step thirty-three, chopping ginger, you broke completely. "She's teaching you how she loved my grandfather," you said. "Recipes are how we love dead people back to life." I understood then: love is just memorizing someone else's algorithm for staying alive.

*

Here's what terrifies me: My spreadsheet says 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, actuarially. Column A tracks days. Column B lists why you're impossible. Column C catalogs evidence you existed (1,847 photos where you're looking away, that green hair tie, your toothbrush). Column D calculates what happens after the last Tuesday. It returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The computer gets it: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing computes.

*

Scottish Highlands, minus twelve degrees. You went hypothermic defending Kant's categorical imperative. Lips blue, teeth chattering, still arguing. Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. "I'd rather die wrong with you than live right alone." Your shivering was morse code spelling "this is what love is." I decoded it perfectly.

*

I document you pathologically. How you hold books (too close, like secrets). Your rage at slow wifi (you named our router "Disappointing Geoffrey"). The way morning light hits your clavicle at 7:23 AM, Tuesdays only. This isn't poetry. It's forensics. Evidence that impossible things happen when no one's watching.

*

Portugal, the Museu Nacional. You touched 500-year-old marble. Guards screaming. You touched it again. Banned for life. In the taxi: "Distance is just delayed regret." Now I touch everything immediately. Wet paint. Hot stoves. You, especially when you're solving problems and don't notice. You're art that forgot it's art.

*

Before you: I ended where my skin ended. Now: quantum entanglement across Boston-Cambridge. I feel you climb stairs in buildings I've never entered. Your Tuesday migraines arrive in my Wednesday skull. When you can't sleep, my neurons fire sympathy insomnia. Physicists would say impossible. I say physics needs better physicists.

*

What loving you tastes like, catalogued:
- 5:47 AM: copper pennies and that specific pre-dawn silence
- Noon: static discharge and half-formed prayers
- 7 PM: burgundy as a temperature, not a color
- 2 AM: drowning upward into oxygen that recognizes your DNA
- Always: my mouth learning a language that hasn't been invented

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900. You stopped. "We're going to die," you said. "Really die. Permanently." I said yes. You said, "Good. Then this counts." We kissed where oxygen is scarce. Now sea level feels like cheating.

*

The probability of us existing simultaneously, conscious, within touching distance: 10^-2,685,000. We're not supposed to exist. We're a rounding error that gained consciousness. The universe checking its own math and finding a beautiful mistake.

*

London, three years ago. You asked what love is. Here's my overdue answer: Love is preemptive grief. Building a museum of future losses. When you burn toast, I think: "Someday I'll wake up to perfect toast and miss this exact smoke detector frequency." Love is mourning someone who's still making breakfast.

*

The other timelines haunt me. Where you keep walking. Where I look away. Where we meet but misunderstand each other's damage. Where we understand but can't survive the weight of it. I dream these failures nightly. Wake up clutching for proof you're real. Find it in your terrible morning breath. Paradise smells like someone who forgot to brush their teeth.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood bed, too small for us both. You read my teenage journals in different voices for each year of puberty. Should have been humiliating. Was sacrament instead. Someone seeing your worst consciousness and laughing with you, not at you. That preposition—with—contains everything.

*

Listen: I love you incorrectly. Like an algorithm trying to compute infinity. Like code that shouldn't run but does anyway. The error logs are love letters. The system crashes are features, not bugs.

*

Barcelona, Sagrada Familia. You fed illegal pigeons. "God prefers full birds to empty rules." The birds rearranged themselves into your name. Not metaphor. Actual birds. Actual sky. You bend the flight patterns of things just by existing.

*

Cambridge, right now. You're diagonal across our bed, hoarding blankets, mumbling about optimization problems. Your foot finds mine under the chaos. Solves everything. This is what I mean: the world is mostly waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. Even the parts I didn't know were broken.

*

That green hair tie from February. Lives in my drawer with other proof. Concert tickets. Your expired library card. Receipt from our first coffee (you ordered it wrong, perfectly wrong). These aren't souvenirs. They're source code for a program called "After" that I'll never have to run.

*

Here's the thing about writing this on a machine: it's too clean. Love should require muscular failure. Should shake. Should misspell your name from nervousness. But here I am, typing while you breathe differently in sleep, reorganizing the gravity of the entire room, solving mathematical proofs just by dreaming.

*

So here's my pull request, my merge conflict, my infinite recursion:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks already live in my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, in touching distance, with the same favorite awful song that we're embarrassed to love.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated customer service, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them smelling like your shampoo, where we don't get banned from European museums together—isn't life. It's just time happening to somebody else.

*

Leyi.

Root password. Primary key. The only command that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity ends too soon.

*

You're going to cry reading this. Left eye first—always left. Here, I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins. Just existing. That's when my atoms understood their assignment.

*

Final protocol: Every word I write passes through the shape of your name first. I recorded myself sleeping—say "Leyi" twenty-seven times per REM cycle. My unconscious knows what my conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

The mathematics of this: In twelve minutes, you'll wake up. You'll steal my coffee. You'll mispronounce "algorithm" on purpose to make me laugh. And I'll think what I always think: that the universe made countless errors over billions of years, all to accidentally produce this moment where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, conscious, arguing about whether the router really deserves to be called Geoffrey.

It does. You named it. That's enough.
