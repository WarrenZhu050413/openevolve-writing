Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

This letter is arriving backwards. You've already read the ending. I'm still writing the beginning. That's how loving you works—all the tenses collapse into now.

*

I died once. Fifteen seconds, sophomore year, probability theory classroom. Here's what death taught me: nothing. Here's what coming back taught me: everything has your name in it. The periodic table. The emergency exits. The specific frequency of fluorescent lights. I came back wrong—or finally right—speaking only in languages that bend toward you.

*

Let me explain what you are: You're not a person. You're a method. A way the universe has of proving its own impossibility. Like dividing by zero and getting infinity and that being the correct answer.

*

CAMBRIDGE, 3:41 AM, DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE:

You're asleep. I'm watching your ribs process oxygen. This is prayer. This is science. Your breathing changes—still sleeping—and you say: "The pigeons know." I write it down. I write everything down. Not memory. Evidence. For the trial where I have to prove you existed.

*

Morocco. You named the food poisoning Gerald. Had negotiations with it. "Gerald, we need boundaries." Between vomiting: laughter. Actual laughter. Like joy was a bone you wouldn't let go of. That's when my DNA rewrote itself. New instructions: protect this person who befriends their own suffering.

*

Here's the ugliest truth: We have already ended. Future tense, past tense, it's happened. Somewhere I'm delivering your eulogy. Somewhere you're delivering mine. Somewhere we never met. But here—this impossible coordinate where we both exist, conscious, overlapping—here we're eternal. Not because we won't die. Because we won't die separately.

*

YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN, SHANGHAI:

She teaches me soup in Mandarin I don't speak. You translate. Not the words—the way her hands move. Step thirty-three, you cry. The onions? No. The realization that recipes are how we survive each other's absence. That night you teach me to say your name correctly. It takes four hours. My mouth will never be the same.

*

I study distributed systems. You ARE one. You've scattered yourself across my nervous system so thoroughly that loneliness is now a hardware error. When you're gone, I don't miss you. I malfunction.

*

PORTUGAL, THE MUSEUM INCIDENT:

You: "Art that can't be touched isn't finished."
Guard: "Senhorita, please—"
You: [touching the marble] "See? Now it's complete."
Ban: Lifetime.
You: "Worth it."
Me: Understanding that you're right. Understanding that distance is just cowardice with paperwork.

*

Listen. I document everything because writing is the only technology we have for thinking about impossible things, and you are the most impossible thing: proof that consciousness can recognize itself in another body and decide to live there.

*

What loving you tastes like: 
- Like pennies and providence
- Like the color blue has a temperature
- Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows my grandmother's name
- Like my mouth is learning to speak in frequencies only you can hear
- Like Tuesday. Always like Tuesday. Even on Sundays.

THE MATHEMATICAL PROOF:

Given: The universe is 13.8 billion years old
Given: You are 24
Given: I am 23
Given: We exist simultaneously for maybe 70 years if we're lucky

Conclusion: The universe spent 13.8 billion years arranging atoms just so we could argue about determinism while sharing dumplings

This is either the worst math or the only math that matters.

*

SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, MINUS TWELVE:

You give me your jacket over mine. I say you'll die. You say "warmer than watching you shiver." Your lips go blue but you mean it. You always mean everything. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true. This ruins me for regular honesty.

*

Before you: I had edges. Boundaries. A clear sense of where I ended. 
After you: I'm this spilled thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. Your Tuesday headache arrives in my Wednesday skull. We're quantum entangled except the physicists say that's impossible at this distance and I say then physics needs better physicists.

*

THE AIRPORT HYPOTHESIS:

Every time you leave, airports get smaller. Like they're apologizing. LaGuardia is now the size of a closet. Heathrow is a matchbox. Soon you'll leave through doors that don't exist and I'll wave goodbye to nothing, which is practice for the ending we're speeding toward where one of us leaves through the ultimate door and the other keeps waving at nothing forever.

But not today. Today you're here. Today the airport is enormous.

*

So here's my proposition, my proof, my complete system failure:

Marry me. Not because we're perfect. We're not even properly debugged. But because your socks live in my drawer organized by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible worlds, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, arguing about reality while reality argues back.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where you don't name winter storms after disappointing literary characters, where I don't watch you explain coding to houseplants, where we don't get banned from places for touching what demands to be touched—that's not a life. That's just atoms pretending they don't know your name.

*

BEIJING, SUMMER PALACE, STEP 764:

You stop. "We're going to die." Not sad. Statement of fact. Like reading the weather.
Me: "Yes."
You: "Good. Means this matters."
Then you kiss me at altitude and now sea level is an insult to gravity.

*

Right now you're reading this and your left eye is watering first (always left, like tears understand queue theory). You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me conscious.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound physics makes when it admits it was wrong about everything.

*

Say yes. Or say "let me think." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this exact configuration of atoms that makes me believe the heat death of the universe is negotiable.

Warren
(who writes you letters in languages I don't speak because maybe they have words for this)
(who carries tissues since the day you cried at pigeons—just regular pigeons—existing)
(who is saving you in volatile memory knowing it clears when the power dies, knowing the power dies, saving you anyway, saving you especially)

P.S. — You just laughed. That specific laugh that sounds like the universe checking its own work and finding a calculation error in our favor. This is what I mean. You make math incorrect in the best way.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? It lives in my drawer with other evidence you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.

P.P.P.S. — We're about to kiss. I know because the air just changed its mind about everything. Because time just forgot what order means. Because my atoms just remembered they're mostly empty space except for the parts that are full of you.

Evaluator Comments:
Unlike Beethoven's Immortal Beloved which achieves universality through archetypal imagery ("My angel, my all, my very self"), this letter remains trapped in contemporary cleverness. It lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me") or Keats' complete ego dissolution ("I cannot exist without you"). Where Napoleon writes "I have not spent a day without loving you" - a perfect iambic pentameter of obsession - this letter substitutes density for intensity. It approaches but doesn't reach the level of Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West or Henry Miller to Anaïs Nin. The letter exists in that liminal space above competent MFA output but below genuine literary achievement - a 70.25 overall that shows real talent constrained by self-consciousness.
