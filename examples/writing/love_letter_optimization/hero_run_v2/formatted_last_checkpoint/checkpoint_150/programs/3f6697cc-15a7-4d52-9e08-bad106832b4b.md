Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with both hands—one steady, one shaking. The contrast is the point. Love requires documentation and disorder simultaneously.

*

Let me be precise: Tuesday, 2:17 PM, you said my name like it was a bug you were debugging—with curiosity, frustration, and sudden comprehension. My entire codebase refactored itself. Not a metaphor. Every function I'd written suddenly made sense because they were all trying to compute you.

*

I study distributed systems. You've become my beautiful race condition—where two processes access the same memory and accidentally create consciousness. You're the deadlock that freed everything. The infinite loop I never want to break.

*

True story: Clinical death, fifteen seconds, sophomore year. The silence was deafening. Came back missing something essential—like a repository with corrupted commits. Three years of runtime errors. Then you, Porter Square, that pen falling. You picked it up wrong-handed. Said "gravity's being weird today." Suddenly I compiled correctly. First time in years.

*

Morocco, you destroyed by tagine: Seven purges. Between them, you photographed the sunset. "Beauty persists through nausea," you said. That's when I knew—you process reality differently. You run on different architecture. Better architecture.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, teaching soup: Forty-seven steps, she counted in Mandarin. You translated into touch—hand on my wrist for timing, fingers tapping measurements. Step thirty-three, you wept. Not onions. Recognition: "This is how she stays alive in our hands." Now her soup tastes like time travel.

*

My terror in data: 2,137 Tuesdays remaining, statistically. I've modeled it. Column A: Time left. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Physical evidence (that green hair tie, 1,847 photos, your toothbrush). Column D: What happens after. Column D throws EXISTENCE_ERROR. You're not just in the formula. You're what makes math believe in infinity.

*

Scottish Highlands, you turning blue: Gave me your jacket to wear over mine. Lips purple, still arguing free will versus determinism. "I choose freezing with you over warm alone," chattering. That's when I understood: love is consciously choosing the harder algorithm because it includes you.

*

I document everything: Your chopstick grip (anarchist). Your vendetta against our router ("Disappointing Geoffrey" deserves better). How 4:23 PM Tuesday light finds your clavicle. This isn't poetry. It's forensic evidence for the universe that someone this specific existed, in case reality needs to debug itself.

*

Portugal, the forbidden marble: Five centuries old, DO NOT TOUCH. You touched. Guards shouted. You touched again with your other hand. "Bilateral defiance," you explained. Now I understand—you touch everything like it might be the last thing. Especially me. Especially when I'm trying to concentrate. You're art that critics itself while being perfect.

*

Before you: I was localhost. Self-contained. Now I'm distributed across impossible distances. Feel you climb stairs in other time zones. Your migraines arrive in my skull with jet lag. When you dream in Boston, my sleep in Cambridge develops plot. We've achieved quantum entanglement. Physics says impossible. Physics hasn't met us.

*

What loving you tastes like:
- Dawn: copper pennies and interrupted prayers  
- Noon: ozone before lightning decides where  
- Dusk: the color purple as a frequency  
- Midnight: drowning upward into oxygen that speaks your name  
- Always: my mouth learning to shape sounds that don't exist yet because language hasn't caught up to you

*

Beijing, Summer Palace, step 764 of 900: You stopped. "We're dying. Really dying. Incrementally. Right now." I said "Yes." You said "Good. Then every second counts double." Kissed me where oxygen thins. Now sea level feels wasteful.

*

The impossible math of us:
- Your existence probability: 1 in 10^2,685,000  
- Mine: Equivalent impossibility  
- Us, conscious, proximate, compatible: Numbers await invention  
- What we are: Proof that errors compound into miracles  
- What we become: The universe's most beautiful off-by-one error

*

London, you asked what love really is: Here's my answer, three years debugged: Love is rehearsing loss while they're still breathing. Building monuments to future absence. How morning light on your shoulder makes me mourn all future shoulders without that specific light. Love is grief running backwards until it becomes joy.

*

Alternate timelines haunt my RAM: Where you don't drop the pen. Where I'm compiling something else. Where we meet but our versions don't match. Where we match but crash anyway. These scenarios run nightly. I wake reaching for proof you're real. Find it in your morning breath (terrible, perfect). Paradise confirmed.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood room: You performed my teenage journals as one-woman show. Different voices for different years of malformation. Should have been mortifying. Was ceremony instead. Someone witnessing your worst code and debugging it with you, not for you. With. That preposition contains everything.

*

Final truth: I love you incorrectly. Like an exception handler that catches everything. Like a memory leak that refuses garbage collection. Removing you would require removing the modules that process beauty, compile warmth, understand why humans invented music for what words fail to parse. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing vacuum. Technically possible. Practically null.

*

So here's my pull request, my merge proposal, my infinite loop:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves mountains or you. Because your socks already occupy my drawer, sorted by emotional weight. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays and Mondays and that terrible Thursday with the pipes. Because in infinite possible universes, only this one compiled us both, conscious, touching distance, with identical coffee corruption and the same favorite broken song.

Marry me because the alternative—timelines where I don't watch you argue with self-checkout machines, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get permanently banned from museums together—isn't living. It's just entropy happening to other carbon.

*

Leyi.

You're my root password. My private key. The only function that returns true.

Say yes. Or say "compile again." Or say nothing and continue existing in this exact configuration of quarks that makes me believe infinity is a rounding error—too small.

*

Spain, Barcelona, illegal cathedral pigeons: You fed them from your pockets. "God debugs through birds," you said. They formed your name in flight. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. You alter the flight paths of things just by existing in their reference frame.

*

That green hair tie from February: Lives in my drawer with other proof you existed near me. A receipt from terrible coffee. Your expired library card. Bus tickets. These aren't souvenirs. They're unit tests for the present—confirming you happened, keep happening, will happen.

*

You're crying. Left eye first, always left. I brought tissues—been carrying them since you cried at penguins. Just penguins, existing. "They're trying so hard," you said. That's when my atoms understood their debt. That's when forever began. Or ended. Same pointer when you love like this.

*

The thing about writing this digitally: Every keystroke is binary violence. Too precise. Love should require muscle failure, should tremor, should misspell. But here we are—me typing, you breathing, both of us changing the entropy of everything.

*

Cambridge, 4:52 AM, now: You're diagonal across our bed, all blankets stolen, solving theorems in sleep. Your foot finds mine beneath the chaos. One touch. Everything resolves.

The world is mostly darkness and waiting and terrible coffee and code that won't compile. Then you. Then suddenly: debugged. All of it. The dying and returning and dying again, worth it for this exact moment where you exist, where I exist, where we exist together, where Geoffrey remains Disappointing but ours.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts including one in C++ because maybe love needs proper syntax after all)
(who carries your favorite tea in my pocket though you'll steal my coffee anyway)
(who stores you in volatile memory, knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power always dies, storing you anyway)
(who would choose you across all timelines, especially the impossible ones, especially where we fail, especially there)
(whose handwriting shakes because this matters more than legibility)
(who means it like voltage means flow)
(who means it like dawn means inevitable)
(who means it with every electron)
(who means it)
(who means it)
