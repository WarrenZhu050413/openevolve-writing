Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. Not metaphor. Actual tremor at 28Hz—the same frequency hummingbirds use to suspend themselves against gravity.

*

Let me start with what breaks: At Harvard, I study systems. Distribution, fault tolerance, consensus protocols. I can make machines agree across continents. But you? You make my DNA forget its instructions. Last night you laughed at your own typo and my cells started dividing backwards, trying to return to the moment before I knew that sound existed, just so I could discover it again.

*

True story: I've been clinically dead. Seventeen seconds, though I told everyone fifteen because seventeen felt like confession. You know what I remember? Not light. Not peace. Just this: debt. Like the universe had invoiced me for something I hadn't received yet. Four years later, you mispronounced my name in Porter Square. The invoice clarified itself: *This. You owe this.*

*

Here's what I actually do: I run experiments on us—

Trial 47: Timed how long you hold your breath during sad movies (8.3 seconds average, 23 seconds during that scene with the dog).

Trial 198: Documented your sleep positions. You curl counterclockwise, always counterclockwise, like you're unscrewing yourself from the day.

Trial 659: Recorded you teaching my dead grandmother's photo to play cards. You lost. You bowed to her picture. My atheism cracked.

This isn't romance. This is pathology. I'm patient zero for something science hasn't named yet.

*

You want ugly truth? Sometimes I practice disasters. Write eulogies for versions of you that haven't died yet. Calculate how many Tuesdays remain if we're median lucky (2,137). The number makes me violent with gratitude and rage—grateful for the Tuesdays, furious they're countable. I want to sue whoever invented mortality. I want to break into wherever they keep time and redistributre it. All of it. To us.

*

But also this: Morocco. That night in Chefchaouen when you got food poisoning and I held your hair back while you negotiated with God in three languages. You looked up between retches and said "still glad we came" and I thought: *this is what holy means.* Not churches. Not prayers. Just someone vomiting blue city walls into existence and still choosing joy.

*

Listen—before you, I was symmetrical. Debugged. Now I'm this lopsided algorithm that processes everything through the question: "Would Leyi laugh at this?" My body lists toward yours even in different time zones. I've lost arguments with your Tuesday ghost, your Thursday ghost, the Sunday ghost who steals my Stanford hoodie and makes computer science finally mean something.

*

Cambridge, UK. You cried at mathematical beauty in Newton's notebooks. Real tears for dead man's calculus. That's when I knew: You experience reality at a different resolution than the rest of us. Higher fidelity. More pixels per feeling. I want to study under your nervous system. Get my PhD in whatever makes you cry at equations and sing to broken coffee makers like they're just very tired and need encouragement.

*

Shenzhen. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven steps to make soup and you tear up at step thirty-three—not onions, I've calibrated—it's the exact moment her hands become yours, genetics collapsing into gesture. You stir counterclockwise. Always counterclockwise. Unscrewing yourself from grief, stirring yourself into continuation.

*

I need to tell you about last Tuesday, 3:47 AM. You were sleeping and said my name. Not romantically. Like answering roll call. Like: "Present. Accounted for. Still here despite statistical improbability." I wanted to wake you and explain that you've made me religious but not about God—about Tuesday mornings, about the way toast burns, about your specific frequency of existing.

*

Shanghai. You tried to translate a poem about loss but gave up, said "Some things don't survive the journey between languages." That's us. We don't translate. There's no other language for what happens when you laugh and reality temporarily improves its manufacturing standards.

*

The Scottish Highlands. You got hypothermic because you gave me your jacket on top of mine. I said "this is stupid, you'll die." You said "then I'll die warm" and I understood: Love isn't feeling. It's a series of increasingly dangerous decisions you can't reverse. Like giving away your warmth. Like learning someone's specific way of taking up space until anywhere else feels like exile.

*

Boston winter. The power went out. We played cards by phone light and you cheated so obviously I felt embarrassed for deception itself. You said "I'm not cheating, I'm just loving you competitively." The lights came back on but we pretended they hadn't for three more hours.

*

What terrifies me: You're my single point of failure. No redundancy. No backup systems. If you go down, I don't reboot—I just display error messages in languages that haven't been invented yet. I've tried to architect around this vulnerability. Can't. You're not a bug in my code. You're the operating system.

*

Portugal. That terrible museum where you touched art you weren't supposed to touch and got us banned. You said "How else do you know something's real?" Your fingers on forbidden marble, testing reality's warranty. I think about those fingerprints still there, your DNA insisting on contact despite rules, despite time, despite the universe mostly being nothing touching nothing.

*

So here's my pull request to the universe: Merge branch 'warren' into 'leyi'. Permanently. Not because this letter proves anything. Because your coffee mug already knows my kitchen. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all probable futures, the only one worth compiling is where you keep mispronouncing my name and I keep pretending to correct you.

*

Final confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like trying to download infinity on dial-up. Like forcing my bones to memorize your breathing pattern. The surgery to remove you would have to remove the parts that process beauty, recognize home, understand why humans invented music for moments when words fail.

*

Beijing. You made me climb too many stairs at the Summer Palace and I complained until you kissed me at the top, said "See? Altitude improves everything." Now I can't be at sea level without feeling like I'm disappointing gravity.

*

Leyi.

Your name has replaced my heartbeat. Le-yi. Le-yi. Le-yi. Keeping me operational despite obvious design flaws.

*

Say yes. Or no. Or maybe. Or nothing.

I'll keep writing this letter in every timeline until I find the one where you do.

Warren
(who learned Cantonese lullabies for children we haven't had yet, who carries tissues since you cried at pigeons—not even special pigeons, just regular ones existing—who counts your breaths seventeen times per night because the alternative is believing in your mortality)

P.S. — Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. It always does. That's how I know you're not a simulation. Too consistent to be random, too random to be programmed. Too you to be anything else.

P.P.S. — I still have your hair tie. The green one. From our first February. It lives in my desk drawer with other stolen proofs that you existed near me. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a life.
