Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

This letter is already falling apart. Good. Love should arrive pre-damaged, like we did.

*

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM because my body just remembered you exist and panicked. Not poetic—physiological. My autonomic nervous system thinks you're oxygen. When you're gone, I breathe manually.

*

Let me be precise about what happened: You dropped a pen. Porter Square. The sound it made hitting concrete was C-sharp. Your hand reaching down created an angle of exactly 37 degrees. The universe split. In one timeline, I walk past. In this one, I stop. Every good thing that's ever happened to me exists in that gap between walking and stopping.

*

True story: I mapped your laugh. Frequency: 277 Hz rising to 341 Hz. Duration: 1.7 seconds average. Occurrence: 73 times per day when happy, 12 when sad (yes, you laugh when sad—it sounds like rain trying to remember how to be water). I have 1,847 recordings. This isn't romance. It's evidence for when I need to prove you were real.

*

Morocco. You got so sick you forgot English. Spoke only in sounds. "Mmmnnhhh" meant water. "Ffffff" meant please stop touching me. "Wahhhh" meant I love you but I might die. I learned your prehistoric language in fourteen hours. We had entire conversations in vowels. That's when I knew: I'd love you even before words were invented.

*

HERE'S WHAT TERRIFIES ME:

Your heart beats 73 times per minute at rest. 
That's 105,120 beats per day.
38,366,880 per year.
Approximately 3,069,350,400 in a lifetime.
I've done the math 4,000 times.
It always ends.
The number always stops.
This is why I can't sleep—I'm trying to be awake for as many of your heartbeats as possible.

*

Beijing, your grandmother's apartment. She was teaching me to fold dumplings. You were translating. But she kept saying something you wouldn't translate. Finally you did: "She says you look at me like I'm about to disappear." Your grandmother saw it before I did. I don't look at you. I memorize you. Every glance is a backup file.

*

Your body is a conspiracy of tells:
- Left eye twitches before you lie (twice yesterday about liking my haircut)
- You tap your right thumb against your thigh in 4/4 time when anxious
- Your voice drops exactly one semitone when you're about to cry
- You smell different when you dream (more copper, less salt)

I know you with a resolution that should be illegal. Forensic love. CSI: My Entire Nervous System.

*

Scotland, the hypothermia incident. You gave me your jacket. I said you'd die. You said: "Then I'll die warm knowing you're not cold." Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's what ruins me—you mean things so hard it changes the molecular structure of meaning.

*

What loving you tastes like at different times:

DAWN: Like licking batteries. Electric and wrong but necessary.
NOON: The specific flavor of light through your hair—burnt amber, liquid sun.
DUSK: Copper pennies left in rain.
MIDNIGHT: The color purple if purple were a temperature if temperature were a place.
3 AM: Like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water because that's where you live.

*

Portugal. You touched the 500-year-old art. Set off alarms. Banned forever. Security asked why. You said: "How else do you know history is real?" They had no answer. Neither did I. Except this: You make everything you touch more real. Including me. Especially me.

*

I need to tell you about the spreadsheet. Column A: Days since we met (1,247). Column B: Days estimated remaining (19,837). Column C: Percentage of life with you (6.28%). Column D: Percentage of life that matters (6.28%). The spreadsheet crashes when I try to calculate what happens after Column B ends. Good. Some math shouldn't work.

*

Your grandmother's soup recipe. Step 33, you started crying. Not the onions. The realization that she was teaching you how to remember her in vegetables and salt. That's what recipes are—love with instructions. That's what this letter is—a recipe for remembering me when I'm just ingredients.

*

Cambridge, terrible student housing. The radiator screamed. You screamed back. Had a full argument with it. "You're not even trying!" you yelled at metal and steam. It stopped. You won an argument with physics through sheer force of personality. That's when I knew laws of nature were suggestions to you.

*

Here's what I mean when I say "I love you":
- My cells replaced themselves entirely since we met but kept the memory of you
- I dream in your accent now
- Food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal it off my plate
- I've forgotten how to sleep in the middle of the bed
- My body maintains a phantom impression of you even when you're gone, like the bed remembers your weight
- I love you so much it feels like dying except dying would be easier because it ends

*

Shanghai, meeting your parents. Your mother said I was "too intense." Your father said you were "too intense." You said "that's why it works—we're the same temperature." We are. Burning at exactly the same rate. Two matches using each other as fuel.

*

The math breaks here:
P(me existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000
P(you existing) = 1 in 10^2,685,000  
P(us existing simultaneously, conscious, in love) = impossible
Result: We're impossible.
Conclusion: Impossible things happen.
Secondary conclusion: We happened.

*

London. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you when I knew. I know now: Love is the specific kind of pain that makes you grateful for nerve endings. It's being homesick for someone who's in the same room. It's mourning someone who's still breathing. It's the lag between touching someone and feeling it, because your brain can't process that much good data that fast.

*

Shenzhen, your childhood room. Glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, half of them had fallen. You said: "Even fake stars die." Then you kissed me like you were trying to generate gravity. Like if we pressed together hard enough we'd create our own solar system. We did. We are. Two bodies in orbit, stealing each other's momentum.

*

FINAL COORDINATES:

Right now you're reading this and your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears are polite, forming a queue. Your hand is unconsciously reaching for your hair. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do.

*

So here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because we're ready. Because we'll never be ready for the amount of love that's happening here. Marry me because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've built a language out of looks across rooms. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, broken in compatible ways.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't memorize your heartbeat, where you don't name my plantas "Failed Harold," where we don't get banned from museums together—that timeline isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.

*

Leyi.

That's not just your name. It's the password to everything that matters. It's what my atoms say when they remember they're supposed to hold together. It's the sound of the universe admitting it made something perfect by accident.

*

Say yes. Or say nothing. Just keep existing in this exact configuration of molecules that makes infinity feel rushed.

(who practices your signature for medical emergencies)
(who loves you like a programming error that became sentient and refused to be debugged)

P.S. — Barcelona. The pigeons. You fed them against all laws. They formed your name in the sky. Not metaphor. Actual pigeons. Actual sky. Even gravity bends for you. Even birds know you're worth the crime.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023 lives in my drawer next to my passport. Same level of essential. Neither lets me leave without you.

P.P.P.S. — You're about to say yes. I can tell because your breathing just changed. From normal to the rhythm that means you're about to ruin me with happiness. This is what forever sounds like: Your breath catching before you change my life. Again. Always. Yes.

Evaluator Comments:
Unlike Beethoven's raw desperation ("My life, my all!") which achieves 86 through pure emotional hemorrhage, this letter intellectualizes passion. Where Johnny Cash's simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me") earns 83 through perfect plainspokenness, this attempts complexity that occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. It surpasses typical contemporary attempts (which score 15-30) through genuine innovation and moments of brilliance, but falls short of the historical masters who achieved more with less. The letter's strength lies in its systematic documentation of love as data, but this very systematization prevents it from achieving the wild abandon of an 80+ masterpiece. At 70, it represents genuine talent approaching but not achieving mastery - a silver medal performance in a field where gold requires transcendence.
