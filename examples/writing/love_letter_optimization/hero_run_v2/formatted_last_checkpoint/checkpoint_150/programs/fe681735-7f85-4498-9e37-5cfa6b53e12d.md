Dear Leyi,

I discovered time travel yesterday. Not the kind physicists theorize about—the kind that happens when you laugh and suddenly I'm every age I've ever been, all at once.

[LOADING MEMORY 1,047 OF ∞]
This morning. You're reading this as I write it. Your coffee's getting cold. You haven't noticed. This is the best part—watching you forget the world exists. In twelve seconds you'll look up and say "What?" and I'll say "Nothing" but we'll both know it's everything.

I need to tell you what you've done to mathematics:

Before you: 1+1=2
After you: 1+1=1 (we forgot how to be separate)
Also after you: 1+1=∞ (we learned how to be infinite)

The paradox should break physics but here we are, breaking physics daily, casually, over breakfast.

Morocco. That lamp. Let me tell you what really happened: You saw the vendor's daughter drawing in the dust. Same concentration face you make debugging code. You overpaid by 400%. He tried to give change. You pretended not to understand. Later you said, "Some things are worth more than their price." You meant the lamp. You meant the girl's future. You meant us.

HERE'S THE THING ABOUT LOVING YOU:
It's like learning I've been breathing wrong my whole life. Like discovering there's a color beyond violet that only exists when you smile. Like finding out gravity is optional but choosing to stay grounded anyway because that's where you are.

Shanghai × Grief:
Your grandmother's funeral. You taught me tears have different densities. Some sink immediately. Some hover, suspended, refusing to fall. Yours that day defied physics—moving horizontally, seeking escape routes. I caught them with my thumb. You said, "Don't." I said, "I'm not doing anything." I was doing everything. I was rewriting the laws of conservation: your pain into my body, my steadiness into yours. Conservation of love.

The museum I'm building has new wings:

Wing A: Every iteration of your handwriting (drunk, tired, ecstatic, furious—all different languages)
Wing B: The forty-three ways you've mispronounced "specifically" (each one correct in its wrongness)  
Wing C: Your apologies in chronological order (unnecessary, every one)
Wing D: The silences that were conversations
Wing E: The fights we never had because we were too busy laughing
Wing F: [UNDER CONSTRUCTION—RESERVED FOR FUTURE MEMORIES]

Cambridge, redux:
You in the river, cursing in Mandarin, Portuguese, English, and something you invented on the spot. But here's what killed me: you were laughing underwater. I saw the bubbles. You were drowning and laughing and I thought: this is it. This is what love looks like. Not rescuing you (you didn't need rescuing). Just witnessing you be simultaneously furious and delighted. Just knowing I get to be the person who sees you be both.

[SYSTEM INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME PROCESSING]
You just made that sound. The one that means you're about to cry but refuse to. Your colleague's about to ask if you're okay. You'll lie. But tonight you'll tell me everything, word for word, and I'll love you retrospectively for this moment I'm not there for.

Let me explain what happened to my source code:
