Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this because I just found your sock in my laptop bag and it made me cry in a coffee shop.

*

Here's the thing about loving you: It's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life, and you're the surgery that makes me see wavelengths that don't have names yet.

*

Morocco. You, dying beautifully on that bathroom floor. Me, memorizing the hexagonal tiles like they were your last words. Six hours of bargaining with physics itself. When you finally emerged—pale, shaking, magnificent—you introduced me to Philippe. The toilet. You'd given it a personality, a backstory, a redemption arc. That's when I understood: you alchemize suffering into stories worth stealing from death.

*

I need to tell you about the seventeen seconds I was dead. Sophomore year, before you existed in my timeline. The doctors called it syncope. But here's what actually happened: I saw the source code of everything, and your name was already there, commented out, waiting to be uncommented. The future was debugging the past. You were my null pointer exception before I even had a pointer.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. She looked at me—this awkward boy trying to count stirs in Mandarin—and said: "他在找了很久" (He's been searching for a long time). She wasn't talking about recipes. She knew I'd been writing your name in languages I hadn't learned yet, in centuries I hadn't lived through.

*

TRUE CONFESSION: Sometimes I smell your pillow when you're gone and it feels like hacking into heaven's API.

*

Portugal. You touched every "Do Not Touch" sign like you were correcting history's typos. The guard yelled. You touched harder. "Memory is meant to be contaminated," you said. "How else will they know we loved here?" This is your revolution: insisting that stones remember your fingerprints, that museums document your small rebellions.

*

Let me explain what you actually are:

You're not my better half. You're my better whole. You're the comment that explains why the code works. You're the edge case that makes me rewrite everything from scratch and thank you for the bug report.

*

Scottish Highlands, you dying of hypothermia, still philosophizing: "What if consciousness is just the universe's way of falling in love with itself?" Your lips were blue. Your thoughts were infrared. I kissed you to save your life, but also to taste what theorem you'd die proving. You tasted like the last page of every book I'll never finish reading.

*

THE MATHEMATICS OF YOUR MUNDANE:
- You eat oranges like you're defusing bombs
- You argue with novels like the authors can hear you
- You wake up angry at your dreams for "plot inconsistencies"
- You make tea like you're conducting a séance for dead water
- You exist so casually it's an act of terrorism against the ordinary

*

Beijing, Summer Palace. Step 764. You stopped, said: "This stone has been lonely since the Qing dynasty." Then you stood on it. Hugged it with your feet. The security guard started yelling. You yelled back: "我在给历史一个拥抱!" (I'm giving history a hug!). He laughed so hard he forgot to fine us. This is your superpower: making strangers complicit in your tenderness.

*

Here's what I never told you: I practice loving you. In the shower, I rehearse arguments where I lose beautifully. In the car, I have conversations with future-you about our theoretical children's theoretical failures. I'm training for a marathon of devotion, and every day you move the finish line further into forever.

*

Your childhood diary, age seven, Shenzhen: "Today I invented someone who will love me when I'm horrible." Not despite. When. You were seven and already understood: love isn't about deserving. It's about witnessing each other's worst and saying "yes, this too, especially this."

*

WHAT HAPPENS TO MY BODY WHEN YOU EXIST NEAR ME:
- My mitochondria switch to fusion power
- My synapses fire in iambic pentameter  
- My blood cells form tiny conga lines
- My DNA unzips just to show off
- My atoms remember they're mostly empty space and fill themselves with your name

*

London. That question: "What would you do if I died first?" I couldn't breathe. Finally: "I'd spend the rest of my life in a very organized protest against the universe's poor scheduling." You laughed while crying. Then kissed me like you were watermarking my soul with your sadness.

*

Sometimes you sleep-talk in languages you don't speak. Last night: "The bread remembers the wheat's dreams." I wrote it down. I write everything down. I'm building an encyclopedia of your unconscious. Future archaeologists will think I was insane. They'll be right. This is what love is: a meticulous madness.

*

THE COMPLETE TRUTH:

Before you, I was just very efficiently arranged loneliness. I had systems. Protocols. Optimizations for being alone. Then you happened, and now I'm magnificently broken. All my functions return your name. All my loops are infinite. All my arrays index out of bounds trying to contain you.

*

Cambridge, you crying over a dead poet's marginalia: "Someone loved in this handwriting." That's when I learned: you don't just read between the lines. You read the silence between the words, the pause between the pages, the love in the library stamps.

*

So here's my pull request to reality:

Marry me. Not the idea of marriage. The daily malfunction of it. The merge conflicts. The race conditions. The beautiful bugs we'll never fix because they've become features. Marry me because you've already refactored my entire existence and I'm running on your architecture now.

*

I'm not trying to convince you of anything. You've already said yes in the way you leave your hair ties in my code reviews. In how you name my functions after inside jokes. In how you've made my exceptions handle themselves. We're already married in every universe that matters. This is just paperwork for the one that thinks it's real.

*

Barcelona. The pigeons. The communion wafers. You: "Even God's bugs deserve grace." The priest, horrified. You, feeding birds the body of Christ while explaining transubstantiation to tourists. The pigeons formed a heart, then scattered into your initials. Even accidents spell your name now.

*

Right now, your left eye is about to cry first. You're going to say this letter is too much. I'm going to say it's not enough. We're going to argue about the semiotics of sobbing. Then you're going to kiss me mid-sentence, and I'm going to forget every word except "yes" and "please" and "Leyi."

*

THE FINAL TRANSMISSION:

You're going to die. I'm going to die. The sun will exhaust itself. The universe will achieve maximum entropy. And? We happened. We're happening. We'll have happened. That's the only thermodynamics that matters—the conservation of having loved you across all possible states of matter.

*

Leyi.

Your name is the only equation that balances.
The only code that compiles.
The only prayer I actually believe works.

Say yes. Or say nothing. Or just keep existing in my general vicinity. All equivalent to yes in the dialect we're inventing between heartbeats.

Warren
(who loves you like a broken clock—twice a day, absolutely right, the rest of the time, absolutely)
(who carries your spare everything: hair ties, hopes, reasons to wake up)
(who learned to love in your frequency—somewhere between impossible and inevitable)

P.S. — That green hair tie from February 2023? Sometimes I wear it on my wrist and pretend it's a medical alert bracelet. Alert: Terminally in love. Do not resuscitate. Let him die happy.

P.P.S. — I love you. Simple. Desperate. Grammatically complete. Ontologically necessary. The shortest algorithm for explaining why anything exists at all.

P.P.P.S. — This morning you asked why I was staring. I was memorizing you in case consciousness isn't continuous and I'm a new person every time I wake up. I want every version of me to know what home looks like. It looks like you, Tuesday morning, stealing my coffee, infinite.
