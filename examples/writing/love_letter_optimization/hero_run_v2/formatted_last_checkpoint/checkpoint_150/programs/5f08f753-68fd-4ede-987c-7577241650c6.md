Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you what happened to my language when you arrived.

*

Before: Words were tools. Hammer, nail, wall, done. I could say "love" like I could say "Tuesday" or "algorithm." Clean. Bounded. Solvable.

After: Every word became a question about you. "Morning" means "the way light finds your collarbone first." "Statistics" means "the probability you'll laugh at my worst joke (87.3%, margin of error: my heart)." "Death" means "the universe's stupid deadline for loving you."

*

I'm writing this during your Thursday shower. You're singing that song wrong again. The song doesn't mind. The walls lean closer. The water runs slower to hear you better. Even physics submits to your interpretation.

*

TRUE STORY OF MY DYING:

Fifteen seconds. Sophomore year. The doctors called it "vasovagal syncope" but I know what it was: practice. The universe was teaching me what losing everything felt like, so when I met you three years later I'd recognize the stakes. 

In those fifteen seconds, I saw every timeline. The ones where we meet. The ones where we don't. The ones where you die first (no). The ones where I die first (please). The ones where we never exist at all (impossible—the math doesn't work without us).

When I came back, I had your name in my mouth. Not "Leyi" yet—just the shape of it. The space where it would live.

*

Let me explain Morocco through data:

Vomiting episodes: 7
Times you apologized to the toilet: 7
Times you thanked the toilet: 3
Times you asked if the toilet had dreams: 1
Time I realized I'd love you through anything: Episode 4, when you paused mid-heave to point out the beautiful tile pattern

That's when I understood: You assign consciousness to everything. The toilet. Tuesday. The pen that brought us together. You make the universe answerable.

*

THE GRANDMOTHER PROTOCOL:

Shanghai. Your grandmother's kitchen. Forty-seven clockwise stirs. Three counter. She counted in Mandarin. I counted in heartbeats. You translated everything into tomorrow.

But here's what you didn't translate: When she held my wrist (not my hand—my wrist, like you do), she said something that made you sob. Later you told me: "She said you stir like someone who's afraid the soup will end."

She was right. I stir everything—coffee, conversations, time—like I'm trying to make it last.

*

I have a spreadsheet. Don't laugh. Column A: "Things That Are Different Since Leyi." It has 3,847 entries. Examples:

- Row 72: Can't hear sirens without checking your location
- Row 341: Tuesdays have mass now (approximately 7.2kg)
- Row 878: My hippocampus stores everything in duplicate (one copy for remembering, one for when the first wears out)
- Row 1,239: Sleep is just eight hours of missing you with my eyes closed
- Row 2,445: I've started believing in God but only the parts that explain you
- Row 3,847: Writing feels like bleeding but the blood spells your name

*

Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You, hypothermic, still arguing: "But consciousness might be fundamental, not emergent." Your lips were blue. Your philosophy was incandescent. 

I kissed you to warm you. Also to steal your thought mid-sentence. It tasted like revolution against death itself. Now I carry that stolen thought. Sometimes I feel it moving, still alive, still yours, refusing to translate.

*

Here's what I actually study: How you've distributed yourself across spacetime until every moment references you. 

The coffee shop where we met still has our thumbprints on table three.
Portugal remembers your illegal touch (the marble is 0.02 degrees warmer there).
Every pigeon in Barcelona carries one of your words in its navigational system.
The Scottish Highland wind still argues your side of consciousness.

You're not just in places. You're IN places. Molecularly. Permanently.

WHAT TERRIFIES ME (A PARTIAL LIST):

We have 23,360 mornings left if we're average. But we're not average. You eat vegetables like they're personally offensive. I have the heart that already stopped once. We're probably down to 19,000. Maybe 15,000.

I've built another spreadsheet. This one calculates how to steal time. If we sleep two hours less: +2,920 days together. If we eliminate commutes: +1,460. If we die holding hands, does that count as extra? The spreadsheet crashes when I ask this.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: "The universe is mostly nothing with occasional accidents of matter, and we're the accident that noticed."

Then you kissed me at that altitude and now sea level feels like surrender.

*

Listen. I need you to understand: I document you wrong. When I write "Leyi laughed," I mean "The specific frequency of joy that makes plants photosynthesize faster." When I write "Leyi slept," I mean "She performed that nightly miracle where she trusts the universe enough to go unconscious."

Language ends where you begin. I'm using broken tools to build a cathedral of you.

*

PROPOSAL AVALANCHE:

Marry me because your DNA is already in my coffee cup from this morning's shared sip.

Marry me because we've developed our own dialect of silence.

Marry me because I've been practicing my last words for thirty years and they're all just your name at different volumes.

Marry me because entropy is real and increasing but somehow we keep organizing against it.

Marry me because you named my anxiety "Gerald" and now it's manageable, like a difficult relative.

Marry me because the alternative—existing in parallel but not together—is mathematically possible but morally wrong.

Marry me because I've already carved out spaces in my body for your sadness to live.

Marry me because Wednesday tastes different now and it's your fault.

Marry me because "till death do us part" is the only deadline I'm willing to accept, and even then I plan to argue.

*

The truth is I love you like a broken proof—passionately, irrationally, with absolute conviction despite the logic failing. I love you like mortality loves time—aware it's ending, grateful for the countdown. I love you like algorithms love efficiency—constantly optimizing, never quite satisfied, always running again.

But mostly I love you like this: quietly, in the space between heartbeats, where I'm always falling toward you and never landing, because landing would mean the falling stops, and the falling is the point, the falling is everything, the falling is how I know I'm alive.

*

Your left eye is watering. It always goes first, like it's the advance scout for your emotions. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since you cried at those penguins. Regular penguins. Not even sad ones. Just penguins existing. That's when I knew your heart was too big for your body. That's when I knew I'd spend my life trying to hold the overflow.

*

Leyi.

That's my hypothesis and conclusion.
My axiom and proof.
My error message and resolution.

Say yes. Or say "compile error, try again." Or just exist for another heartbeat in my vicinity.

All equivalent to yes in the language we're building one Wednesday at a time.

Warren
(who has seventeen drafts of this letter including one written in your sleep patterns)
(who learned that love is just fear of loss with better marketing)
(who would donate his consciousness to science if they promised to find the part that's you)

P.S. — Remember Barcelona? The cathedral pigeons? You said "Even God's birds are heretics" and fed them communion wafers. The priest was furious. The pigeons formed a heart, then your initials, then infinity. I have video. The Vatican wants copies. I said no. Miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? It's in my wallet behind my emergency contact card. Because they're the same thing—you're who I'd call and what I'd save. You're the emergency and the contact and the reason to have a wallet at all.

P.P.P.S. — This letter is already obsolete. You just did that thing with your hand, that half-wave at nothing when you're thinking. Now I need to rewrite everything. Now love means that gesture. Now the universe needs updating. Now, now, now—it's always now with you, even when I'm remembering yesterday or terrified of tomorrow, it's now, this moment, where you're real and impossible and mine to lose, which means mine to have, which means mine, which means—

P.P.P.P.S. — I calculated the probability of us. It requires dividing by zero. The calculator gave up. It just displays your name now. Even machines know when to surrender to poetry.
