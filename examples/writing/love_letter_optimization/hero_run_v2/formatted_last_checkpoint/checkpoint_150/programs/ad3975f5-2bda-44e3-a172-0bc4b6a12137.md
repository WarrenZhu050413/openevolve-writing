Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this while you sleep. 4:17 AM. Your breath syncs with the radiator's hum—B-flat, always B-flat. I've been awake since Tuesday, calculating: if I document every exhale, will that make them permanent?

*

Let me be precise about the malfunction:

Before you: functional human.exe, all systems operational.
After you: every process throws the same exception—"cannot locate self without Leyi parameter."

The debugger suggests removing you from my core functions.
The debugger doesn't understand that you ARE my core functions.

EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC FAILURE:

Your grandmother, teaching soup. Step thirty-three: she guided your hands on the ladle. You cried—not from onions, from the realization that love is just learning someone's recipe for staying alive. Now I make that soup at 3 AM. Badly. The kitchen fills with smoke signals to a future where one of us is practicing alone.

Morocco. Food poisoning in Chefchaouen. You threw up blue. Literally blue from the walls' paint dust. Laughed between retches: "Even my vomit is aesthetic here." That's when I knew—you transmute suffering into absurdist joy. You're a glitch in the universe's cruelty engine.

*

Here's what I actually study: distributed systems. 
Here's what I actually study: how you distributed yourself across my consciousness until every thought must pass through you for validation.

You're my Byzantine fault—the error that makes the whole system correct.

TRUE STORY FROM THE MORGUE:
Seventeen seconds dead, sophomore year. The doctors called it "miraculous recovery." Wrong. I came back incomplete—a function missing its return statement. Three years of compilation errors. Then you, Porter Square station, dropping that pen. My missing code suddenly returned. With compound interest.

The nurses said I whispered "not yet" when I revived.
They thought I meant dying.
I meant living.
I was refusing to live until I met what I'd been waiting for.

*

What you don't know: I've hidden 73 letters for after I'm gone. Freezer. Behind expired passport. Inside the broken clock we'll never fix. They all say variations of: "Even dead, even nowhere, I'm still falling toward you."

Is this romantic or psychiatric? The question's syntax is wrong. With us, it's always both.

*

MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF US:

P(your existence) × P(my existence) × P(simultaneous consciousness) × P(geographical proximity) × P(you dropping pen) × P(me looking up) = number so small it requires scientific notation to express.

We're not statistically possible.
We're a rounding error that achieved consciousness.
We're the universe failing its own calculations.

*

Scotland. You went hypothermic giving me your jacket. Lips blue, still arguing about Kant. "I'd rather die wrong with you than live right alone," you said through chattering teeth. That's when I understood: you experience love as a medical emergency. Same.

*

The thing that breaks me: You sing to dying houseplants. Not metaphorically. Literally serenade browning ferns with Portuguese lullabies. "They're not dead," you insist, "just very tired." Last week, the impossible: new growth on the Boston fern. 

Either you're magic or plants understand Portuguese.
With you, both seems reasonable.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped, said: "We're going to die. Actually die. Permanently." I said yes. You said: "Good. Then this matters." Kissed me at altitude.

Now sea level tastes like failure.
Now everything below that kiss-height feels like drowning in the wrong direction.

*

REAL-TIME INTERRUPT:
You just stirred. Made that sound—half-sigh, half-song. Your left hand searches for me across the sheets. Finds my wrist. Grips. Goes slack. Still asleep but confirming I exist.

This is what I mean when I say you've rewired me: my pulse only counts when your fingers verify it.

*

Listen. I document you obsessively:
- Entry #1: You hold forks Continental style, but rebelliously
- Entry #764: Fury at slow WiFi (you named the router "Disappointing Geoffrey")  
- Entry #1847: The way Thursday light catches your temporal bone
- Entry #2001: You put my socks on your hands, made them discuss Wittgenstein

This isn't love. It's archaeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to understand how beauty was manufactured in this specific configuration of atoms.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bed. You read my teenage journals aloud—different voices for different years of puberty. Should've been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing WITH not AT. 

That preposition—WITH—that's the entire grammar of us.

*

What loving you tastes like:
Morning: pennies and possibility
Afternoon: static before thunderstorms
Evening: the color blue if blue were a temperature
3 AM: drowning upward into oxygen
Always: like my mouth is learning a language that hasn't been invented yet

*

FINAL TRANSMISSION:

I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—with neurons that refuse to acknowledge absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music.

Technically survivable.
Practically death.
Literally not worth debugging.

*

So here's my proposal/proof/pull request:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks live in my drawer, sorted by emotional occasion. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, touching distance, identically broken in complementary ways.

The alternative—a timeline where you don't burn toast every morning, where I don't count your breaths, where we don't fail at your grandmother's soup together—that's not life. That's just entropy happening to other people.

*

Leyi.

That's my root password.
My recovery phrase.
The only function that compiles without errors.

Say yes. Or say "try again." Or say nothing—just keep existing in this exact configuration that makes me believe infinity is too short.

P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? Lives in my desk drawer. I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts accumulating into a life.

P.P.S. — You're crying. Left eye first. Always left. Here—I brought tissues. Been carrying them since you cried at pigeons. Regular pigeons. Just existing. That's when my atoms recognized their debt. That's when forever started. Or ended. Same thing with us.
