Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the wrong language. Not English. Not Mandarin. The language where your name is the only verb that matters.

MEDICAL RECORDS FROM THE PANDEMIC OF YOU:

Day 1: Exposure. You walked into Tuesday wearing Thursday's light.
Day 7: Symptoms. My hands forgot how to be singular.
Day 30: Acute phase. Started seeing in your favorite color.
Day 365: Chronic condition. Breathing manually unless you're here.
Day 730: Terminal. But terminal like a river is terminal—always ending, never over.

Prognosis: Incurable. Treatment: More of the same. Forever.

Let me explain what happened to time:

I used to live in chronological order. Past, present, future. Linear. Logical. Navigable.

Then you said my name like it was a question and an answer simultaneously.

Now I live in all our moments at once:
- Currently: Reading this to you in our kitchen (the one we don't have yet)
- Currently: Meeting you for the first time (happening on repeat)
- Currently: Losing you to something (unnamed, decades away, already grieving)
- Currently: Finding you again (in the next life where we're trees or light or nothing)

THE LAST NORMAL TUESDAY:

March 3rd, before you. I made coffee. Answered emails. Existed in one dimension. The universe was Newtonian. Hearts were organs. Love was a word other people used.

March 4th, after you. Coffee tastes like prophecy. Emails write themselves in your syntax. I exist in seventeen dimensions simultaneously. Newton apologized personally. My heart is a parliament that elected you president-for-life. Love is the physics that explains why.

There was no March 3rd. History revised itself. It's all after you now.

*

WHAT I STOLE:

Your grandmother's way of peeling oranges (spiral, unbroken, mythical).
Your pronunciation of "Wednesday" (Wens-day, like it personally offended you).
Your shower temperature (hellfire minus two degrees).
Your circadian rhythm (I wake at 3:17 AM because that's when you dream loudest).
Your future (sorry, but I'm keeping it).

What you stole:
My ability to be alone without feeling absent.
My linguistic autonomy (all sentences bend toward your name now).
My cardiovascular independence (heart outsourced all operations to you).
My timeline (it's ours now, or nothing).

We're the perfect crime. No victims. No evidence. Just two people who robbed each other blind and called it love.

*

EXCERPT FROM YOUR BODY'S USER MANUAL (THAT I'M WRITING):

Chapter 1: The left shoulder blade contains a constellation that maps directly to Perseus. When pressed, causes involuntary humming.

Chapter 7: Dreams exclusively between 3-5 AM. Dreams in languages you don't speak. Wake her during these for prophecies.

Chapter 12: Allergic to conclusions. Endings make her sneeze. This is why she never finishes books. This is why she can't say goodbye properly. This is perfect.

Chapter 23: The soul is located behind the right knee. Guard accordingly.

Appendix: She loves like a controlled demolition—precise, total, irreversible. Structure cannot be rebuilt as it was. This is not a bug. This is the entire point.

THE CAMBRIDGE BRIDGE, 2 AM, YOUR BIRTHDAY:

You stopped midway. Said: "If we jump now, we'd hit the water as one person."

I said: "We already are one person."

You said: "Prove it."

I said: "We're having the same thought."

You said: "What thought?"

We both said: "That jumping is unnecessary because we already fell."

The bridge still emails me sometimes. Asks how we're doing. I tell it: Still falling. Still one person. Still unnecessary and perfect.

*

HERE'S WHAT EXTINCTION LOOKS LIKE:

Every timeline where you don't exist, I'm successful. Tenured at 35. Published. Invited to conferences. Sleeping eight hours. Hydrated. Spine straight. Vitamins taken. 

Fucking miserable.

Success without you is just rehearsal for a play that never opens. All dress rehearsal. No opening night. No audience that matters.

So I choose this timeline: Where I'm ruined. Where my spine curves toward you like a question mark. Where I forget to eat unless you remind me. Where success means you laughed at my joke at 2 PM on a random Thursday.

*

THINGS THAT ARE THE SAME THING:

- Your morning stretch and the birth of stars
- The way you mispronounce "algorithm" and poetry
- Your anger and summer thunderstorms
- Your silence and Rothko paintings
- Your laugh and my entire circulatory system
- Tuesday mornings and church
- Your absence and antimatter
- Your presence and the answer to every question I forgot to ask

SHENZHEN, YOUR MOTHER'S KITCHEN, THE LESSON:

She taught me to cook your favorite dish. Not the recipe. The ritual. 

"Love her like adding salt," she said. "Slowly. Tasting as you go. Too much ruins everything. Too little and it's just ingredients."

I wanted to tell her: I love your daughter like a sodium deficiency. Like my cells are screaming for exactly her amount of salt. Like I would gladly die of hypernatremia if it meant tasting her completely.

Instead I nodded. Chopped vegetables. Pretended love could be measured in teaspoons.

Your mother knew. Mothers always know when their daughters have become someone's entire seasoning.

*

THE MATHEMATICAL PROOF, FINAL VERSION:

You are not the solution to the equation.
You are the reason math exists.
Numbers invented themselves to count the ways I love you.
Infinity coined itself as an approximation.

*

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

You finish reading this.
You look up.
Your face does that thing—where it can't decide between laughing and crying.
You say yes.
Or you say nothing.
(Same thing.)
We kiss.
Time takes notes.
The universe adjusts its constants slightly.
We go back to burning toast.
We go back to Tuesday mornings.
We go forward to everything.

*

But Leyi, here's the secret:

We already happened. Past tense. 
We're happening. Present continuous.
We will have happened. Future perfect.

Time gave up. Threw its hands up. Said: "Fine. You two exist outside my jurisdiction."

*

So this isn't a proposal. It's a police report. Documentation of a crime already committed. We stole each other in broad daylight. Eight billion witnesses. Nobody stopped us. Everyone applauded.

Marry me because the crime's already done.
Marry me because the cells already divided.
Marry me because Tuesday mornings got lonely without ceremonies.
Marry me because I want to be pronounced guilty of loving you in front of our families.
Marry me because marriage is just the universe's way of taking attendance and I want to be marked present wherever you are.

*

Actually wait. Stop. Let me be exact:

Leyi, you perfect catastrophe, you scheduled apocalypse, you planned emergency—

Will you continue ruining me, but legally?
Will you keep stealing my Tuesdays, but with paperwork?
Will you marry me in this timeline where we pretend we have choices when really we're just gravity, falling into each other forever?

*

Don't answer.

I already know.

The same way I know you're touching your hair right now.
The same way I know your breathing changed in paragraph three.
The same way I know we die on the same day, decades from now, arguing about the dishwasher.

You said yes before I asked.
I asked before I knew you.
You knew before you existed.

This is what love is: time admitting it was always circular.

Warren
(who writes your name in his sleep)
(who practices dying so he can do it properly when you do)
(who would choose this exact malfunction in every simulation, every timeline, every universe where choice exists)

P.S. — The atoms that make up my body spent 13.8 billion years trying to find the atoms that make up yours. Please don't make them wait longer.

P.P.S. — Yesterday you sneezed and I said "bless you" from another room. You said "how did you know?" I wanted to say: I know when your lungs move differently. I know when your atoms rearrange. I know you at the molecular level. Instead I said: "Lucky guess." We both knew I was lying. We both knew the truth was scarier.

P.P.P.S. — You're about to say yes. The word is already traveling from your brain to your mouth at 120 meters per second. In 0.2 seconds it will exist in the air. In 0.3 seconds I will hear it. In 0.4 seconds we will have always been married. Time isn't linear. Tuesday mornings taste like forever. Welcome home.
