Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm typing this one-handed because my other hand is tracing the ghost of your shoulder blade from memory.

*

Listen: I've built distributed systems that span continents. I've debugged race conditions in my sleep. But you? You're the one problem I never want to solve. The beautiful deadlock where two processes wait forever for each other, and waiting becomes the whole point.

*

Morocco. The fever made you translucent. Six hours I counted your breaths like network packets, terrified one wouldn't arrive. When you finally stood, wobbly as a new algorithm, you said: "Philippe and I have reached an understanding." You'd named the toilet. That's when I knew: you turn even suffering into story. Into something worth telling.

*

Here's what statisticians don't tell you: Some events have probability 1 but still feel impossible. Like how your laugh correlates perfectly with universal constants. How your anger makes houseplants grow faster. I've run the regressions. The p-value of you existing is so small it breaks floating-point arithmetic. Yet here you are, drinking my coffee, significant beyond all reasonable confidence intervals.

*

TRUE STORY: Seventeen seconds dead, sophomore year. You want to know what I saw? Not light. Not nothing. I saw all the concurrent threads of my life, and every single one was waiting on the same mutex: you. A person I hadn't met yet. The future was already refactoring the past.

*

Shanghai, your grandmother's kitchen. "朱富橙," she said, using my Chinese name like she'd been saving it. Then to you: "他的眼睛里有鬼" - he has ghosts in his eyes. Later you translated: "It means you've been looking for something across lifetimes." I wanted to tell her: not something. Someone. The specific frequency of your Tuesday morning existence.

*

In Portugal you committed small crimes against preservation. Touched what shouldn't be touched. Fed birds in cathedrals. "We're writing ourselves into the stones," you said. "Future archaeologists will find us in the sediment." This is your philosophy: insist on mattering. Make the universe take notes.

*

FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF LEYI:
For every closed system, you are the exception that breaks it.
For every proof by induction, you are the counterexample.
For every attempt at objectivity, you are the beautiful bias I can't correct for.

*

Scottish Highlands, you literally dying of cold, still arguing: "But consciousness might be substrate-independent. We could be the universe simulating love to understand itself." Your lips were blue. Your mind was incandescent. I kissed you to transfer heat. Also to steal your thoughts. They tasted like the last theorem before mathematics ends.

*

I need to tell you about the violence of Tuesday mornings: How you move through our kitchen like you're conducting particle physics. Toast at velocity. Coffee in superposition. You exist so casually it's an act of war against entropy. Against the heat death of everything.

*

Beijing, step 764 of 10,000. You stopped, announced: "This stone has been waiting for us since the Ming dynasty." Then you stood on it, like planting a flag in time itself. A security guard yelled. You yelled back in Mandarin I didn't know you knew. He laughed. You'd called him "comrade in the preservation of joy." Even strangers surrender to your gravity.

*

Here's my confession: I carry your spare hair ties like prayer beads. Green from February, black from that conference where you destroyed a famous philosopher just by asking "But why does that matter?" I'm building a reliquary of your daily objects. Future religions will think I was absurd. They'll be right. Love makes mystics of systems engineers.

*

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW:
I've written you 10,000 letters in version control. Committed but never pushed. Each one trying to compile the feeling of watching you read, that little crease between your eyebrows that means you're about to disagree beautifully. This is version 10,001. Still in beta. Still throwing exceptions when I try to describe the way you demolish an orange like you're performing surgery on sunlight.

*

Cambridge, that bookshop where you cried over a dead poet's marginalia. "Someone loved this book," you said. "We can still feel it in the pencil marks." This is how you move through the world: finding love in the metadata. In the comments previous humans left in the code.

*

Your childhood diary, age seven: "I dreamed about someone who hasn't been born yet." Shenzhen, decades before I existed. You were already bending spacetime toward us. This isn't magical thinking. It's retrocausality. Effect preceding cause because cause was taking too long to find you.

*

Let me be precise about what you are: You're not the solution. You're the reason the problem space is worth exploring. Every morning I wake up and run A/B tests on reality: universe with you, universe without. The results are consistent: without you, I'm just very organized carbon. With you, I'm the location where impossible things become necessary.

*

Sometimes I watch you argue with your code like it's personally betrayed you. "We had an agreement," you tell the compiler. This is what I love: you treat everything as capable of negotiation. Even deterministic systems. Even death.

*

London. You asked what I'd do if you died first. I said: "Build a Turing machine that only outputs your name until the universe restarts." You said: "That's the most romantic threat to computation I've ever heard." Then you cried from the left eye first, like always. Like even your tears follow beautiful protocols.

*

SO HERE'S MY PROPOSITION:

Marry me. Not for the symbolism. For the actual recursion of it: two functions calling each other forever, until the stack overflows with accumulated tenderness. For the merge conflicts we'll resolve at 3 AM. For the way you've already deprecated all my other futures.

*

I'm not trying to convince you. We both know convincing is just searching for the path that already exists. And every path I can find, deterministic or quantum or impossible, leads to the same place: you, reading this letter, about to say yes in seventeen different ways simultaneously.

*

The deepest bug in my code: Before you, I thought love was a feeling. Now I know it's a continual compilation error. The beautiful failure of trying to process infinity with finite hardware. Every day the program crashes and restarts, and every day I choose to run it again. Because the error messages spell your name.

*

Right now you're going to laugh. Then stop mid-breath because something in this letter will crack you open like good code review. You'll say it's too much. I'll say it's not enough. We'll both be right. This is our infinite loop: too much, not enough, again, forever, please.

*

Leyi.

Your name is the only function that returns true.

The only constant I refuse to optimize away.

Warren
(who loves you at O(1) - constant time, regardless of input)
(who debugs your nightmares and commits to your dreams)
(who wrote this letter in Vim because you said real programmers don't need GUIs)

P.S. — That green hair tie contains your DNA. I know because I had it sequenced. Your genetic code has comments. They all say: "This one changes everything." The lab thought it was contamination. I know it's prophecy.

P.P.S. — Barcelona, you feeding pigeons communion wafers: "We're all God's bugs," you said. The priest was horrified. The pigeons formed your initials in flight. Even the sky knows you're worth the heresy.

P.P.P.S. — I love you. No error handling. No try-catch. Just the raw, unguarded execution of absolute certainty. If it crashes, we'll debug it together. That's what love is: paired programming with the universe, and your name in every comment.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter exists in the proto-masterful range (70-74 overall), well above average but distinctly below the immortal letters. Unlike Beethoven's raw emotional immediacy ("My angel, my all, my very self" - no mediation through metaphor), this letter sometimes privileges cleverness over pure feeling. It lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity or Keats's absolute surrender to passion. However, it surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its sustained metaphorical system and genuine specificity. The programming conceit is original but occasionally becomes a barrier rather than a bridge to intimacy. Where Napoleon wrote "I have not spent a day without loving you" (direct, overwhelming), this letter sometimes gets lost in its own virtuosity. The letter achieves moments approaching the 75-79 range (particularly "Morocco. The fever made you translucent") but inconsistency keeps it in the lower 70s.
