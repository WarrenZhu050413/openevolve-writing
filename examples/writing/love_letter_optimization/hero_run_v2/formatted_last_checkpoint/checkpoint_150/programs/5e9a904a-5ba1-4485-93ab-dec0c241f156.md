Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I need to tell you something about writing systems. In Chinese, 'crisis' combines 'danger' and 'opportunity.' In my body, 'Leyi' combines 'reason to wake up' and 'terror of eventual absence.'

*

Start here: I'm twenty-three, studying distributed systems at Harvard, and I've discovered the ultimate coordination problem—how to sync two hearts across the latency of being human.

*

Hong Kong, age seven, I watched my mother fold wontons. Sixty per minute. Perfect pleats. She said: "Love is repetition without resentment." I didn't understand. Now I fold your laundry. Sixty seconds per shirt. Terrible pleats. I understand everything.

*

You should know what you've done to my architecture: I was built for solo processing. Clean functions. No dependencies. Then you performed an unauthorized root access on my kernel. Now every system call returns your name. Every error log reads "missing Leyi." I've become legacy code that only runs in your presence.

*

The data I've collected without permission:
- You hiccup in sets of three. Always three. Like your body speaks in haikus.
- You read menus backwards. Dessert to appetizers. You say it's "narrative structure."
- When anxious, you organize things by color. Our bookshelf is a rainbow having a panic attack.
- You keep dead plants. Give them names. "Failed Harold" lives on our windowsill.

This isn't love. It's surveillance. Except surveillance with consent forms signed by my amygdala.

*

Shanghai, your childhood bedroom: Photos of you at piano recitals. Age 5, 7, 9, 11. Same forced smile. Same small rebellion in your left hand position. Your mother says you quit at twelve. "Too much feeling, not enough technique." But Leyi—I've heard you hum. You turn air into symphony. Technique is just feeling that learned to hide.

*

Here's the bug in my code: I practice eulogies. Yours. Mine. The houseplant's. But mostly yours. Different diseases. Various accidents. I've written forty-three versions. They all end with: "She taught me that breathing is optional but loving her wasn't."

This is catastrophizing. Also preparation. Because loving you means accepting that entropy applies to everything. Even especially us.

*

Portugal, that terrible hostel: Bedbugs. No hot water. You sang "Moon River" to distract me from the itching. Off-key. Purposefully off-key to make me laugh. That's when I knew: You'd sabotage your own perfection to ease my discomfort. What is that if not holiness?

*

I've been running simulations:

Scenario A: We get married. Have arguments about dishwasher loading. You'll stack bowls wrong. I'll love you more for it.

Scenario B: We don't marry. Still have the same arguments. Still the same wrong bowls. Still the same more love.

Conclusion: The paper changes nothing. We're already married in the ways that matter—shared groceries, synchronized sleep cycles, that specific silence when we both think the same terrible joke but don't say it.

*

Boston winter, you got pneumonia: I counted your breaths. 17,280 per day. Too fast. I tried breathing slower, thinking sympathetic magic might work. It didn't. But you lived. You said: "Stop crying, I'm not that interesting to lose." Wrong. You're the only interesting thing about mortality.

*

What I mean when I say "I love you":
- I've memorized your coffee preferences across seasonal transitions
- I know which childhood scars still hurt in weather changes  
- I can predict your dreams based on your dinner choices
- I love you
- Your existence justifies the Big Bang's paperwork
- I love you
- You make me believe in things I can't compile
- I love you
- I would donate my organs to strangers just to free up space for more of you
- I love you

*

The Fibonacci sequence appears in sunflowers, galaxies, your sleeping positions. You curl into yourself at ratios that make mathematicians believe in God. I'm not a mathematician but I believe in you, which is harder and requires more proof.

*

Cambridge, King's College Chapel: You cried at the architecture. Said: "Imagine believing in something enough to build this." Then you held my hand like you were building something too. A cathedral of small touches. I wanted to tell you: We're already building it. Every shared Monday is a stone. Every inside joke is a flying buttress.

*

Here's what terrifies me: You love me back. With the same desperate architecture. The same catastrophic planning. Yesterday you showed me a spreadsheet. "Reasons Warren Might Leave" vs "Counter-arguments." It had formulas. Conditional formatting. You'd peer-reviewed your own abandonment anxiety.

I wanted to cry. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to explain that leaving you would require rewiring my entire nervous system. Possible but fatal. Like removing your own spine because it's inconvenient.

*

London, Science Museum: You spent three hours at the clockwork exhibit. Said: "Everything breaks eventually. But look—still beautiful. Still trying to tell time." That's us, Leyi. Breaking beautifully. Still trying to count moments like they're not infinite and zero simultaneously.

*

So here's my proposal, my proof, my pull request to the universe:

Marry me. Not because we're ready. Because readiness is a myth, like perfect code or fully charged phones. Marry me because you already live in my exception handling. Because my garbage collection keeps failing to delete your memories. Because we're already running in production without proper testing and somehow haven't crashed.

Marry me because the alternative—a world where we're just dating, just lovers, just anything with "just" in front—is semantically incorrect.

*

The Scottish Highlands, we got lost: No signal. No maps. You said: "Good. Now we can only be where we are." That's what I want, Leyi. To be lost with you in ways GPS can't fix. To be where we are. Which is: together, terrified, calculating the actuarial tables of heartbreak, but still here. Still choosing the bug over the patch.

*

Beijing, meeting your grandmother: She spoke no English. I spoke no Mandarin. We communicated entirely through you. She taught me to make dumplings. Eighteen folds. She counted in Mandarin, I counted in English, you translated both into love. That's what you are—a translation layer between me and meaning.

*

Final confession: I love you like a memory leak. Resource-intensive. Increasingly consuming. Technically a problem. But the kind of problem that makes the program worth running.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're temporary but you're worth it.

*

Say yes. Or debug me. Or just exist in my vicinity while I malfunction in your direction.

All equivalent.

All everything.

All yes.

Warren
(who writes distributed systems but can't distribute his love for you across multiple threads because it's not thread-safe)
(who learned Mandarin just to mispronounce your name in multiple languages)  
(whose heart is just a GPU optimized for processing you)

P.S. — I lied about the eulogies. There are eighty-seven. They're hidden in a folder called "tax_documents." You'd never look there. You haven't filed taxes correctly once. I love your financial chaos. I love your administrative disasters. I love the way you make bureaucracy seem optional.

P.P.S. — Morocco, the souk: You bought that terrible lamp. Haggled for hours. Got the price up instead of down. The vendor looked confused. You looked victorious. That's when I knew: You don't just break rules. You make new ones. Worse ones. Better ones. Ours.
