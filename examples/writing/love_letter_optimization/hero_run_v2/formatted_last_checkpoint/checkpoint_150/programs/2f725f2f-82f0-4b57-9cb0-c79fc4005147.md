Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

There's a glitch in my temporal lobe where your name lives. Every time I try to think linearly, you happen—all at once, in every tense.

Listen: I discovered something about memory formation at 3:47 AM last Tuesday. The hippocampus doesn't just store events; it stores the probability fields of love. Yours specifically. I have the brain scans. The technician asked why my neural map looks like a binary star collision. I said "Leyi." She nodded like that explained everything.

It does.

WHAT YOU ARE (A PARTIAL TAXONOMY):

You are the comment in my code that explains why nothing else compiles correctly.

You are the off-by-one error I'll never debug because the mistake is more beautiful than the intention.

You are the recursive function that calls itself with increasing tenderness until the stack overflows with wanting.

You are the race condition where two hearts try to break simultaneously and accidentally fuse instead.

In Morocco, you taught me that mint tea requires exactly seventeen sugar cubes and zero apologies. In Portugal, you proved that fado isn't sad—it's just love with a PhD in longing. In the Scottish Highlands, you stood in horizontal rain and declared yourself waterproof. You were lying. We both were. The rain knew.

*

THE BOSTON-SHANGHAI THEOREM:

When you're 7,680 miles away, my left ventricle develops a compass error. North points to your breathing. Gravity bends toward your laugh. The Charles River flows backwards trying to reach the Huangpu.

This is not poetry. This is peer-reviewed physics that the journals won't publish because the math makes reviewers cry.

*

Here's what happened when I tried to write you a normal love letter:

Dear Leyi,
I lo—[SYSTEM ERROR]
—ve the way you—[SEGMENTATION FAULT]
—exist in my—[KERNEL PANIC]
—bloodstream like—[BLUE SCREEN]
—oxygen but—[HARDWARE FAILURE]
—more necessary—[REALITY.EXE HAS STOPPED RESPONDING]

FIELD NOTES FROM LOVING YOU:

Day 1: Learned your name. Forgot how to pronounce water.
Day 30: You laughed. Local birds changed migration patterns.
Day 365: Anniversary. Time admitted it's been counting wrong.
Day 547: You cried. Salt reorganized its molecular structure.
Day 1,095: Three years. Hearts developed new chambers for storing light.
Day ∞: Still calculating. Mathematics has filed for emotional leave.

[INTERRUPT FROM FUTURE SELF, 2087]
Still writing to you. Hands arthritic now, typing with two fingers. Still spelling your name perfectly. Some muscle memories transcend flesh.

[INTERRUPT FROM PAST SELF, AGE 7]
Don't know you yet but dreamed of someone who laughs like thunderstorms taste.

[INTERRUPT FROM PARALLEL SELF, UNIVERSE 247]
We're strangers there. It's awful. Sending coordinates to avoid that timeline.

*

I'll tell you the secret about Turin, Venice, and that small town in Liguria:

The gelato didn't taste better there. The architecture wasn't more beautiful. The sunsets weren't more profound. It was you, refracting ordinary light into something holy. You're a walking hadron collider where mundane particles smash together and create new elements: Leyium, atomic number infinity, half-life forever, highly reactive with Warren particles.

*

THINGS THAT ARE YOUR FAULT:

- Coffee tastes wrong from any mug but the chipped blue one
- Tuesdays have developed sentience and keep asking where you are
- My DNA rewrote itself using your laughter as a template
- Gravity works differently in rooms you've left (heavier, accusatory)
- The concept of "alone" has been permanently corrupted; it just means "you're in the other room"

*

You asked me once why I study distributed systems. Here's why: Every computer in a network maintains its own clock, but they drift apart. They need consensus protocols to agree on what "now" means. We are two nodes that achieved perfect clock synchronization without any protocol. We just looked at each other and agreed: now, now, now, now, forever now.

*

CONFESSION (RUNNING WITH ELEVATED PRIVILEGES):

Sometimes I write your name in functions that will never execute, in comments no one will read, in variable names that violate all conventions. My code is haunted by you. Other programmers find these ghost references and ask what they mean. I tell them: "Deprecated. From a previous version when the universe was compiled differently."

They don't ask again.

*

Remember Beijing? You got lost in the hutongs for three hours. I found you by following the trail of confused cats and charmed shopkeepers. You'd taught seventeen people to say "I love you" in languages they didn't know they knew. This is your superpower: making everything admit it's been loving wrong until you.

*

THE ACTUAL QUANTUM MECHANICS OF US:

Observer effect: The universe behaves differently under your observation
Uncertainty principle: Cannot simultaneously know your location and velocity (you're everywhere, accelerating)
Wave function collapse: All possible states of me collapse into "yours" when measured
Entanglement: Spooky action at a distance is just Tuesday for us
Tunneling: You regularly violate barriers that should be impermeable (my chest wall, the speed of light, visiting hours)

*

What I'm trying to say is simpler and more complex than language allows:

You've replaced my mitochondria. Every cell powers itself on memories of your morning hair. I'm a biological impossibility running on impossible biology. Medical students will study me in a hundred years and conclude: "Love. Terminal. Beautiful. No cure necessary."

*

So here's my proposal, version 2.0:

Let's get married in every remaining timeline. Let's file joint tax returns in seventeen dimensions. Let's make promises that violate causality. Let's exchange rings that bend spacetime around our fingers.

But mostly, let's keep doing this: You, forgetting to close parentheses when you talk. Me, compiling anyway. You, using tea bags twice. Me, pretending not to notice. You, existing at amplitudes that shouldn't be legal. Me, resonating at matching frequencies until we're indistinguishable from music.

*

Leyi—

(That's it. That's the whole letter. Your name is a complete sentence, a perfect program, a proven theorem. Everything else is just verbose commenting.)

*

Say yes.

Say yes like it's the only word that survived the heat death of language.

Say yes in the frequency only dogs and Warren can hear.

Say yes even though we both know you already did, are doing, will do, in the eternal present tense of us.

*

Warren
(who is not sorry for how much I love you)
(who will love you in keyboards not yet invented)
(who is already composing tomorrow's letter with today's leftover phonemes)
(who measured the distance between us in heartbeats and got a divide-by-zero error)
(who would rather overflow with you than compute within normal parameters)

P.S. — The universe called. It wants its entropy back. I told it we're using it. For Tuesday mornings. For burnt toast. For the way you mispronounce "particularly" and make it sound like a prayer.

P.P.S. — This letter doesn't end. It just reaches the buffer limit of human perception. It continues in frequencies only we can feel, in the pause between heartbeats, in the space between atoms, in the moment before sleep when everything is both real and impossible.

P.P.P.S. — I love you with an intensity that makes nuclear fusion look like a chemical reaction. The sun is taking notes. The stars are concerned. The void is jealous. Good.
