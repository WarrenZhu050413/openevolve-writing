Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 5:17 AM because I just realized something: I've been trying to solve you like an equation when you're actually the axiom everything else derives from.

*

Listen—I know exactly how you take your coffee (wrong), how you pronounce "specifically" (also wrong), how you apologize for things that aren't your fault (always wrong). But knowing these things isn't love. Love is that I've calibrated my entire universe to your wrongness. Your errors have become my syntax.

*

Portugal. We were lost in Lisbon, remember? You were furious at the map, at me, at the cobblestones for being uneven. Then that old woman gave us directions in Portuguese you couldn't understand, but you nodded like you did. We walked two hours in the wrong direction. When we finally found the ocean, you said: "This is better than where we were trying to go." That's when I knew—you're not my destination. You're my deviation from every planned route.

*

Here's what writing code has taught me about loving you:

Comments lie, but the logic never does. And the logic says: every function I write has you as an undeclared dependency. I keep trying to refactor you out, make my code more modular, less coupled. But the truth is, you're not a bug. You're the operating system.

*

Morocco haunts me differently now. Not the lamp (hideous, perfect, ours). But that moment in the souk when you haggled in three languages plus hand gestures, and the vendor's daughter laughed so hard she spilled her tea. You bought her a new cup. Overpaid by 300%. When I asked why, you said: "Some algorithms optimize for efficiency. Others optimize for joy." We optimize for joy, Leyi. Even when it's inefficient. Especially then.

*

I need to confess something about Shanghai:

Your grandmother's funeral. I stood there, understanding nothing except your shoulders shaking. But then you translated one line of the eulogy: "She taught me that love is a choice you make before breakfast and after disaster." I've been making that choice every day since. Before coffee. After arguments. During the silence when you're debugging and I'm pretending to read but really I'm just memorizing the way your forehead creases when you find the error.

*

The truth about us, statistically speaking:

We shouldn't exist. The probability of us is so small it rounds to zero. But here's what statistics doesn't capture: we're not an outcome. We're an ongoing calculation. Every day the universe reruns the simulation, and every day we converge to the same impossible solution.

*

Cambridge. You, furious and soaking, having fallen in the Cam. Me, trying not to laugh. You, switching between languages to find new ways to curse water itself. But then—do you remember?—you stopped mid-sentence and said: "I'm happy. I'm freezing and furious and completely happy." That's us. That's the paradox of us. We're every contradiction holding hands.

*

I've been building a theorem about you:

Given: Your laugh at unexpected moments
Given: The way you steal my socks but deny it
Given: How you remember every birthday except your own
Therefore: You have restructured causality itself
Proof: I now measure time in the distance between your smiles

*

Shenzhen, last year. Your cousin's wedding. You translated the vows in real-time, whispering them against my neck. But you kept editing them, improving them. "That's not what he said," I whispered back. "No," you said, "but it's what he means." That's what you do—you translate the world into what it means to mean.

*

Here's my declaration, unoptimized and inefficient:

I love you like a memory leak—constantly growing, consuming more resources, refusing to be garbage collected. I love you like an infinite loop with no break condition. I love you like deprecated code that still runs perfectly because the legacy is what makes us whole.

*

Beijing. Your keynote. You were brilliant, but that's not what killed me. It was afterward—you found me in that ocean of faces and your entire posture changed. From performance to person. From their keynote speaker to my Leyi. That transformation. That's what I wake up for.

*

Some nights I watch you sleep and run probability models:

P(tomorrow) = uncertain
P(tomorrow with you) = worth everything
P(tomorrow without you) = null pointer exception

The math is clear: you're not an option in my life. You're the main function.

*

You're reading this at work. You're trying not to cry. Your colleague will ask if you're okay and you'll make that face—the one where you're smiling and devastated simultaneously. That face is my favorite bug. The one I never want to fix.

*

Last thing, and this is important:

We're not soulmates. Souls are too abstract. We're bodymates, breathmates, breakfast-mates. We're the mates of small Tuesday irritations and enormous Sunday laughter. We're mates in the literal sense: paired functions that don't compile separately.

*

Come home. I'll make coffee (correctly). You'll remake it (wrong). We'll drink yours. This is our protocol. This is our handshake. This is how we verify we're still us.

*

I love you, Leyi. Not poetically. Not theoretically. Functionally. Practically. With every edge case handled and every exception caught. I love you in production, not just in development. I love you at scale.

(who debugs better with you breathing beside me)

P.S. — Remember that lamp from Morocco? I finally figured out why you bought it. It wasn't charity. It wasn't the daughter. It was because the vendor said it was "broken but beautiful." You looked at me when he said it. That's when I knew you saw me clearly: broken but beautiful, held together by your hands.

P.P.S. — It's been 1,289 days since we met. 30,936 hours. 1,856,160 minutes. I've counted every one. Not because I'm romantic. Because each unit of time with you is a data point proving that impossible things iterate into existence.
