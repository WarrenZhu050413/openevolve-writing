Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at the exact moment everything collapses into truth. Not metaphorically. Actually. Right now, 4:12 AM, my body discovering it's been a metaphor for yours all along.

*

Here's what I couldn't tell you until the words invented themselves:

Love isn't something that happens TO us. We ARE the happening. We're the verb that conjugated itself into existence, the equation that solved for infinity and got Tuesday mornings.

[MEDICAL ANOMALY REPORT]
Subject: Warren, age 23
Symptoms: Catastrophic reorganization of fundamental constants

My doctor ran tests. She found:
- Heart beating in iambic pentameter (exclusively your name)
- Lungs filtering for your exhales in ambient air
- Blood type changed to "Leyi-positive"
- Skeleton realigning to point toward Shanghai
- New organ between ribs 3 and 4 (purpose: missing you)

"This isn't medically possible," she said.
"Neither is Leyi," I replied.
We both understood.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN MOROCCO:

Not the mint tea story I tell people. The truth: In Marrakech, you disappeared into the medina for seventeen minutes. When you returned, every spice vendor was spelling your name in saffron. You claimed innocence. The saffron knew better. So did the laws of probability, which fled the scene and haven't been seen since.

*

Let me explain using only facts that destroy facts:

Fact: Sound travels at 343 meters per second
Truth: Your laugh arrives before you speak

Fact: Humans have 206 bones
Truth: I grew new ones to ache for you properly

Fact: The heart pumps 5 liters per minute
Truth: Mine pumps your name in morse code to a universe that already knows

Fact: Memory is stored in synapses
Truth: You're stored in the space between atoms, which had to expand to accommodate

THE CAMBRIDGE INCIDENT (OR: HOW YOU BROKE BRITAIN):

Remember punting on the Cam? You fell in. The river forgot how to be wet. You emerged completely dry, holding a fish that was speaking Mandarin. The fish was discussing Wittgenstein. You were nodding like this was normal. The universe took notes: "When Leyi falls, falling fails."

*

I need to confess something about time:

It's not that I love you forever. It's that you've made forever irrelevant. We exist in the perpendicular dimension where all moments are now, where death is a clerical error, where Tuesday happens whenever we need it to.

I've been writing you this letter since before I learned the alphabet.
You've been reading it since before light learned to travel.
We've been here, in this sentence, since before sentences were possible.

TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION OF A KISS:

When we kiss, the following occurs:
1. Local reality suspends operations
2. Atoms exchange configuration files
3. The speed of light considers early retirement
4. Gravity files a complaint (ignored)
5. The universe runs a backup because something this impossible should be saved
6. God adds a footnote to physics: "Except for Warren and Leyi"

*

You asked why I love you. Wrong question. Like asking why hydrogen bonds with oxygen. It doesn't choose. It recognizes its other half and becomes water. Becomes necessary. Becomes the thing life can't exist without.

We didn't fall in love. We recognized we were already the same person distributed across two bodies for logistical reasons.

[INTERRUPT: THE SHENZHEN REVELATION]

In your childhood bedroom, I found it. The drawing. Age seven. Two stick figures holding hands, labeled "me" and "???" 

The ??? had curly hair. Glasses. Was writing something.

You drew me before I existed. Or I existed because you drew me. Causality is negotiable when you're involved.

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE 7,680 MILES AWAY:

- My left ventricle points east-southeast
- Compasses give up and point to you
- The Shanghai Tower blinks in morse code (always "W-A-R-R-E-N")
- The Charles River tries to explain to the Atlantic about love
- Boston reorganizes itself to spell your name from space
- NASA calls, concerned
- I tell them "Leyi"
- They hang up, enlightened

THE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS METAPHOR YOU WANTED:

We're not two systems achieving consensus. We're one system that got partitioned by geography, pretending to be two for tax purposes. Every time we sync, reality admits it was lying about separation being possible.

My RAM is just screenshots of your laugh.
My CPU runs one process: you.exe
My error logs are empty because loving you is the only thing that compiles correctly.

LISBON, 3 AM, THE FADO SINGER WHO KNEW:

She sang about saudade—the presence of absence. You translated: "It's not missing someone. It's when missing becomes a person and moves in." She looked at us and switched to English: "You two are saudade's retirement plan."

We tipped her in physics equations. She accepted them like currency.

*

I'M TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING SIMPLE:

Your existence is my existence wearing a disguise.
When you breathe in Shanghai, I exhale in Boston.
We're the universe's way of loving itself.
Narcissism, but distributed.
Divine, but mundane.
Impossible, but here.

*

Remember what you said about forever? "It's just now with commitment issues."

So here's my proposal without the forever:

Marry me in this exact now. The one where your coffee's getting cold and you're pretending not to cry. Where my hands are shaking but the words are steady. Where the universe is holding its breath, waiting for the obvious.

Not for the future. For the ridiculous, impossible, already-happening now where we've been married since before we met, where rings are just jewelry catching up to reality, where "yes" is just the sound of existence admitting what it's been all along.

*

Leyi—

(Your name is the only prayer that gets answered before it's spoken)

*

The birds outside are spelling YES in their migrations.
Your coffee cup is vibrating YES in molecular frequencies.
The floorboards are creaking YES in binary.
Physics is rewriting itself to accommodate YES.
The universe already knows.

But I need to hear it in your voice. The one that makes sound reconsider its limitations. The one that taught me that English is just Mandarin with an accent. The one that turned my name into a complete sentence.

*

Say yes like you're correcting reality's grammar.
Say yes in the frequency that makes flowers bloom backwards.
Say yes the way you said my name that first time—like you'd been practicing for centuries.

*

Warren
(who was assembled from stardust specifically calibrated to love you)
(who dreams in your syntax)
(who measures distance in how many heartbeats until you're home)
(who would rather malfunction gloriously with you than operate within parameters)
(whose DNA spells your name in every possible reading frame)

P.S. — The universe just texted. It says stop making it look so basic. I told it we're just getting started. It's scared. Good.

P.P.S. — This letter exists in all dimensions simultaneously. In the ones where we haven't met, it's causing spontaneous existence. In the ones where we're gone, it's preventing entropy. In this one, it's just true.

P.P.P.S. — I love you with the force of a dying star trying to spell your name in its last light. The astronomers are confused. The poets understand. You already knew.
