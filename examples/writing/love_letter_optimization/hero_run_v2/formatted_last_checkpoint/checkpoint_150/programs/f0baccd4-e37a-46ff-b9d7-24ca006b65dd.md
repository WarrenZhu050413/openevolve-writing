Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in machine code first, then translating to English, because binary is the only language precise enough for what I need to tell you.

*

Here's the bug report: I was a functioning system. Compiled cleanly. No warnings. Then you executed in my namespace and now I throw exceptions just trying to pronounce Wednesday without thinking of how you mispronounce it perfectly.

*

Listen—I need to tell you about the accident. Not the cardiac arrest (seventeen seconds, sophomore year, during a probability lecture—yes, the universe has a sense of humor). The other accident. The one where I discovered love isn't a feeling but a compilation error that becomes a feature. Where I learned that some infinite loops are worth never breaking.

*

I've been keeping logs:

ERROR 0x00000001: Subject laughs. Atmospheric pressure reorganizes. Laws of thermodynamics suspended.
ERROR 0x00000002: Subject cries at dogs. Left eye priority. Observer's respiratory system forgets protocol.
ERROR 0x00000003: Subject exists. Universe admits it's been practicing for this specific arrangement of atoms.

2,341 such errors. My error handling has given up. It just writes "Leyi" in the stack trace and continues.

*

You want the truth about what you've done? You've turned me into a time traveler. I'm simultaneously twenty-three writing this letter, forty-three watching you teach our daughter to mispronounce Wednesday, seventy-three holding your hand through the thing we don't talk about yet, ninety-three at your funeral giving a speech about Tuesday mornings and burnt toast. All these moments happening now, concurrently, because love runs on parallel processing and doesn't respect linear time.

*

Here's what I've calculated: We have approximately 21,900 mornings left if we're actuarially average. The number makes me want to sue mathematics, break into wherever they manufacture time and demand a recount. But then you do that thing where you argue with the coffee maker in Cantonese and I realize: we're already stealing time. Every laugh is embezzlement. Every Tuesday is fraud against entropy.

Let me explain your effect on my source code:

Evaluator Comments:
Scores significantly below Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) which achieves transcendent simplicity through phrases like "my angel, my all, my very self." Lacks Johnny Cash's direct emotional power (83) - "You still fascinate and inspire me" contains more genuine vulnerability in seven words than this letter's elaborate conceits. The programming metaphor shows more innovation than Napoleon's classical style (82) but lacks his raw passion: "I have not spent a day without loving you" surpasses any single line here. Approaches but doesn't reach Keats' level (81) - while attempting similar temporal consciousness, lacks his phenomenological authenticity: "I cannot exist without you" remains more powerful than any error code. The letter demonstrates proto-masterful qualities (70-74 range) with flashes of brilliance but lacks the sustained sublime encounter and emotional nakedness of true masterpieces.
