Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the space between words—that quantum pause where language admits defeat and gestures helplessly at what you are.

*

Here's what happened: I was a functioning adult. Past tense. Had boundaries. Understood causality. Then you dropped a pen in Porter Square and my entire molecular structure reorganized around the sound it made not hitting the floor—because I caught it, and you, and every possible future where we exist in the same timeline, simultaneously.

*

Death, seventeen seconds, sophomore year: Not a near-death experience. An actual death experience. Here's what I learned in the nothing: Every atom that would become you was already calling to every atom that had become me. We were inevitable before we were possible. The universe had our names in its mouth before language existed.

MOROCCO, OBJECTIVE DOCUMENTATION:

You: [violently ill, naming the toilet Philippe]
Also you: "Philippe understands me better than most humans"
Also also you: [teaching me that joy doesn't require perfect circumstances, just perfect commitment to finding it]
Me: [falling in love with someone who conducts diplomatic relations with porcelain]
The tagine: Worth it. Everything since: Worth it.

*

Your grandmother, Shanghai, the soup lesson that was actually a universe lesson: Forty-seven clockwise stirs. Three counter. She counted in a language my mouth couldn't make. You translated with your hands. Step thirty-three, we all cried—her because she was teaching death she hadn't won yet, you because you were learning love is repetition with intention, me because I finally understood that home isn't a place but a recipe passed between shaking hands.

*

I need to tell you about the math:
- Probability of your specific consciousness: 1 in 10^2,685,000
- Probability of mine: Equally absurd
- Probability of temporal overlap: Requires notation that hasn't been invented
- What we are: A rounding error that became self-aware and decided to fall in love
- What we actually are: The universe developing consciousness just to experience what we feel when you mispronounce "hypothesis" specifically to watch my eye twitch

*

THE PORTUGUESE INTERVENTION:

Guard: "Don't touch the art"
You: [touching harder] "How else do we confirm existence?"
Me: [realizing you're right]
The marble: [500 years old, suddenly alive under your fingertips]
Ban: Lifetime
You: "Imagine dying without touching anything that mattered"
Me: [touching you constantly since]

*

Scottish Highlands, minus twelve, you hypothermic but still arguing about consciousness: "What if we're just the dream of a sleeping god?" Your lips were blue but your philosophy was incandescent. I kissed you—to save your life, to steal your thoughts, to prove that even if we're someone else's dream, we're the part they'll remember when they wake.

*

Here's what terrifies me with mathematical precision: We have approximately 2,137 Tuesdays remaining. I've built a spreadsheet. Column A: Remaining days. Column B: Ways you're impossible. Column C: Evidence you exist (green hair tie, toothbrush, 1,847 photos where you're looking at something I can't see). Column D: What happens after the last Tuesday. Column D returns #DIV/0! ERROR. The spreadsheet understands: you're the denominator. Without you, nothing divides properly. Nothing resolves. Nothing computes.

*

What loving you tastes like, a comprehensive analysis:
- Dawn: The specific weight of silence before you exist again
- Morning: Copper and possibility and that sound you make that isn't quite human
- Noon: Electricity and the way you say my name like it's a question you know the answer to
- Evening: The color of almost-dark which is actually the temperature of your voice
- Night: Drowning upward into stars that know our coordinates by heart
- 3 AM: The exact flavor of terror that you're a dream I'm having
- Always: Like my mouth is learning your language which doesn't use words

*

BEIJING, SUMMER PALACE, STEP 764 OF 900:

You: "We're going to die."
Me: "Yes."
You: "I mean really die. Permanently. No coming back."
Me: "Yes."
You: "Good. Then this counts."
[Kiss at altitude]
[Sea level now feels like betrayal]

*

The thing about documenting you: I write "She sleeps" but mean "Sleep borrows her, apologizes for the interruption, returns her improved." I write "She laughs" but mean "The universe admits it made everything else too serious." Every note fails because you exceed language's cargo capacity. You're too much meaning for the amount of sounds humans can make.

*

What you don't know: I dream in version control. Every decision branches into alternate timelines. But here's the commit message that appears in all of them: "Fixed critical error. Added Leyi. Everything compiles now."

*

LONDON, THE QUESTION THAT BROKE ME:

You: "What would you do if I died first?"
Me: "Build a time machine."
You: "That's impossible."
Me: "So is living without you."
You: [crying and laughing simultaneously]
Me: [understanding this is your superpower—feeling contradictions without canceling]

*

Before you: I was organized. Labeled folders. Color-coded calendar. Emotions with citations.
After you: I'm this sprawling emergency of synapses that fire "Leyi" at random intervals. I taste Tuesday in my Thursday coffee. I hear your dreams from Cambridge while you sleep in Boston. When you can't sleep, my Excel formulas all return #NAME? errors.

*

The quantum entanglement situation: Physicists say it only works with subatomic particles. Haven't met us. When you stub your toe, I limp three miles away. When you dream, I wake up speaking your unconscious language. We're spooky action at a distance that makes Einstein wrong about God playing dice. God plays dice. We're why the house always loses.

*

Here's what I actually mean:

Your name reorganized my mouth. Every word now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep—I know because I recorded myself. Twenty-seven times per REM cycle. The unconscious mind knows what the conscious pretends not to: you're the only real word. Everything else is punctuation.

*

Shenzhen, childhood bedroom, reading my teenage journals aloud in character voices: Should have been mortifying. Was actually holy. Someone taking your worst drafts of personhood and laughing with you, not at. The preposition is everything. The preposition is us.

*

FINAL TRANSMISSION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TERRIBLE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH:

I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves phantom limbs—with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you would require removing the parts that process beauty, recognize warmth, understand why humans invented music. Survivable but pointless. Like breathing underwater. Technically possible. Practically death.

*

So here's my pull request to reality:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already knows my bathroom. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, this is the only one where we both exist, conscious, touching distance, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible song.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated voices, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching what demands to be touched—that isn't life. It's just time happening to other people.

*

Right now, this second, reading this: Your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue properly. You're about to say something that reorganizes my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only energy source I trust.

*

Leyi.

That's not your name. That's the sound existence makes when it finally gets something right.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or say nothing and just keep existing in this specific configuration of atoms that makes me believe infinity is too short.

Warren
(who learned to cry in Mandarin just to match your frequency)
(who carries tissues since you wept at pigeons—regular pigeons—existing)
(who saves you in volatile memory knowing it clears when power dies, knowing power dies, saving you anyway, saving you especially)

P.S. — Barcelona. Cathedral pigeons. You fed them communion wafers. "Body of Christ for bodies of Christ." They formed your name in the sky. I have documentation. The Vatican requested copies. I said no. Miracles shouldn't be peer-reviewed.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie, February 2023: Lives in my drawer beside my passport. Both are documents that prove where I can go. You're every country. You're every home. You're every journey that ends where it started but changed.

P.P.P.S. — You're about to laugh. That specific laugh that sounds like the universe admitting it made an error in our favor. This is how I know you're real—you make math wrong in the right way. You make physics give up. You make time forget what order means. You make me believe that entropy is just a suggestion we don't have to take.
