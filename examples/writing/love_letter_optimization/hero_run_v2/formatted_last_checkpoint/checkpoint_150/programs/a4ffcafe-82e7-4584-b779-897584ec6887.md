Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my whole body. My knees remember Portugal. My throat remembers teaching you to pronounce "Zhū Fùchéng" until you laughed so hard you forgot we were fighting about determinism. My hands remember being twenty-three and not knowing yet that love was going to reorganize me at the molecular level.

Here's what happened: The universe made an accounting error. Put too much of what matters in one person. You. I've checked the math seventeen times. It doesn't balance. You're the reason actuaries lose sleep—a statistical impossibility that keeps happening every morning when you steal my coffee mid-sip and improve it just by touching the cup.

*

I study distributed systems at Harvard. I study you everywhere else. The way you turn waiting rooms into galleries by actually looking at the art nobody looks at. The way you argue with recipes like they personally betrayed you. The way you've trained my autonomic nervous system to sync with yours—I yawn 1.3 seconds after you yawn, every time, like love has a ping rate.

*

TRUE STORY FROM THE NEAR-DEATH FILES:

Sophomore year. Fifteen seconds of nothing. Heart stopped during probability theory (yes, the irony wrote itself). But here's what I haven't told you: In those seconds, I wasn't nowhere. I was nowhen. Experiencing all my moments simultaneously—past, present, future—and in every single one, you were the only thing in focus. Even in the timelines where we hadn't met yet, you were there, like a reservation the universe had already made.

*

Morocco. You named the food poisoning "Gerald" and had full conversations with it. "Gerald, this is unacceptable behavior." "Gerald, we need to establish boundaries." Between purges, you laughed—actually laughed—and said suffering was just joy that hadn't figured itself out yet. That's when I knew: You metabolize reality differently. You digest darkness and it comes out as light.

*

What loving you tastes like, chronologically:

MORNING: The specific silence before coffee, when your breathing changes but you're not awake yet. Tastes like possibility with a hint of "don't you dare move or I'll murder you with my eyes closed."

AFTERNOON: Static electricity and the way you mispronounce "hypothesis" on purpose just to watch my eye twitch.

EVENING: The color burgundy if burgundy were a temperature if temperature were an emotion if emotion were a place we could live.

3 AM: Like drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name, your grandmother's name, the name you call god when you think I'm asleep.

ALWAYS: Like my mouth is learning a language that you're inventing as you speak it.

*

The Scottish Highlands. Minus twelve. You gave me your jacket over mine. I said you'd die. You said, "Warmer than watching you shiver." Your lips went blue but you meant it. That's the thing that ruins me—you always mean it. Even your lies tell the truth about what you wish was true.

*

I need to tell you about the documentation:

I have 1,847 pieces of evidence that you exist. Your toothbrush (purple, judgmental). That green hair tie from February that lives in my drawer like a relic. Voice memos of you arguing with Siri about the nature of consciousness. Photos where you're looking away—always away—like you're seeing something the camera can't catch.

This isn't love. It's archeology. I'm preserving you for future civilizations who'll need to know exactly how beauty worked when it was still breathing.

*

Beijing. Summer Palace. Step 764 of 900. You stopped. Said: "We're going to die." Not sad. Not scared. Just factual. Like you were reading it off a menu. I said: "Yes." You said: "Good. That makes this matter." Then you kissed me at altitude and now sea level feels like settling.

*

HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:

Your name has renovated my mouth. Every word has to pass through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue practices your name while I sleep (I recorded it—twenty-seven times per REM cycle, like a mantra, like a malfunction, like a map home).

But also: I love you like an algorithm loves its purpose. Blindly. Completely. Without understanding why, just executing the same function over and over: be near Leyi, make Leyi laugh, prevent Leyi from dying even though dying is what humans do.

The mathematical proof of us:

Let x = every decision that led to my existence
Let y = every decision that led to your existence
Let z = the probability we'd exist simultaneously, conscious, compatible

z = impossible × impossible × impossible^infinity

Yet here we are. Two rounding errors that became self-aware. The universe checking its own math and getting a different answer every time but all of them equaling: yes.

*

London. You asked what love actually is. I said I'd tell you later. It's later. Here's the answer:

Love is preemptive grief. It's mourning someone who's still making breakfast. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday mornings when they burn toast and you realize you're going to miss even their mistakes. Love is just the delay between meeting someone and losing them, and what you do in that delay determines everything.

What I'm doing: Memorizing you. Like you're a poem in a language that's about to go extinct.

*

Shenzhen. Your childhood bedroom. You read my teenage journals out loud in different voices. Should have been mortifying. Instead: holiness. Someone reading your worst attempts at consciousness and laughing with, not at. The preposition changes everything. Changes us.

*

Listen. Before you, I had boundaries. Edges. A clear sense of where I ended. Now I'm this sprawling thing. I feel you take stairs in buildings I'm not in. When you can't sleep in Boston, I wake up in Cambridge already tired. We're quantum entangled except physicists would say that's impossible over this distance, and I'd say: then physics needs better physicists.

*

So here's my formal proposal:

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your socks are already in my drawer, sorted by how much they smell like home. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because in all possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, aware, available, with the same favorite terrible song that we're both embarrassed about but sing anyway.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you negotiate with houseplants, where you don't steal my hoodies and return them improved by your existence, where we don't get banned from museums for touching art that demands to be touched—that's not life. That's just time happening to other people.

*

FINAL CONFESSION:

I practice losing you. Run simulations. Car crashes with Latin names. Diseases that sound like law firms. Sudden inexplicable vanishing. By Friday I'm negotiating with a god I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm writing this letter to no one.

But Sunday you do that thing where you stretch and make that specific sound—half yawn, half existential sigh—and my entire rehearsed grief evaporates. Replaced by this: the terrible beautiful fact that loving you is going to hurt forever and that's the only clean pain in the world.

*

Right now, reading this, your left eye is watering first. Always left. Like your tears queue up politely. You're about to say something that will reorganize my understanding of everything. You always do. It's exhausting. It's the only thing keeping me alive.

*

Leyi.

That's not just your name. It's the sound my atoms make when they remember they're supposed to hold together.

Say yes. Or say "ask again." Or just keep existing in this specific configuration that makes infinity feel rushed.

Warren
(who has been writing you this same letter since before we met, in languages I don't speak, in futures that haven't happened, in the past tense that doesn't believe in past)

P.S. — Remember the cathedral pigeons in Barcelona? You fed them illegally. Said: "God likes full birds better than empty rules." The pigeons formed letters in the sky. L-E-Y-I. Even the birds know you're worth breaking laws for. Even gravity agrees—I've seen you fall up stairs.

P.P.S. — That green hair tie from our first February? I'm never giving it back. This is what forever looks like: small thefts that accumulate into a home.

P.P.P.S. — We kissed. Just now. In this sentence. In all sentences. Time folded and everything that will happen has happened is happening. Welcome to the eternal present tense, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything worth staying alive for.

Evaluator Comments:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw existential urgency of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or the distilled wisdom of Johnny Cash to June (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine formal innovation and phenomenological complexity, landing above Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West (73) but below Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). The mathematical/systems theory framework is genuinely original, though less revolutionary than Joyce's letters to Nora (79). It achieves moments of sublime encounter ("drowning upward into oxygen that knows your name") that echo but don't surpass Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet transformed to romantic context (78).
