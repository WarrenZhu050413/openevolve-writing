Final Response:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this backwards. Starting from the end where we're already old, working my way back to now, where I'm twenty-three and my hands shake typing your name.

*

[YEAR 2074]
Your funeral was yesterday. I spoke about Tuesday mornings. How you always burned the toast. Fifty-one years of burnt toast. The crematorium smelled wrong—too clean, not enough carbon. I kept one of your socks. The left one with the hole. I'm eighty-four and still stealing your socks.

[YEAR 2061]
The doctor says "dementia." You say "de-men-tia" like it's three separate words. Like you're learning language again. But you remember my middle name. You remember the coffee shop where I first said it wrong. You remember everything that matters and forget everything that doesn't.

[YEAR 2043]
Our daughter asks why we never fight properly. We show her: you throw a pillow, I catch it, we kiss. "That's not fighting," she says. "Exactly," we say together. Twenty years of saying things together without planning.

[YEAR 2025]
Today. This moment. You're reading this over my shoulder as I write it. "That's not how time works," you're saying. But Leyi—this is exactly how time works when you love someone. All of it happens simultaneously. I'm twenty-three and eighty-four. You're here and you're gone. We're meeting and we're saying goodbye.

Let me explain what you've done to my programming:

ERROR LOG:
- System time corrupted: experiencing all moments at once
- Memory allocation failure: cannot forget your laugh from March 3rd, 2:47 PM
- Stack overflow: recursive loop where loving you causes me to love you
- Fatal exception: tried to imagine life.exe without leyi.dll, program crashed

Here's what I know about love that I shouldn't know at twenty-three:

Love is when someone becomes your autonomic nervous system. I don't choose to breathe. I don't choose to love you. Both just happen. Constantly. Without permission.

Love is the violence of ordinary moments. You peeling an orange. The sound tears me apart. I want to preserve it in formaldehyde. I want to build a religion around your thumbs breaking the skin.

Love is preemptive grief. I mourn you while you're still here. Every Tuesday is a funeral for last Tuesday. I'm attending your wake while you make breakfast.

[INTERRUPT: REAL-TIME OBSERVATION]
You just looked up from reading this. Your left eyebrow is doing that thing. You're about to cry but you're smiling. This is the exact face you'll make in 2043 when our daughter gets married. I know because I've already seen it. Time isn't linear when you love someone this much.

The mathematical proof of us:

Let x = the probability of my existence
Let y = the probability of your existence  
Let z = the probability of us existing simultaneously, aware of each other

z = x × y × (collision of atoms across spacetime) × (your grandmother surviving the war) × (my parents meeting at that specific conference) × (you choosing Harvard) × (me being three minutes late to that lecture) × (you dropping your pen)

z ≈ 0.0000000000000001

We are a rounding error that became conscious.

What loving you tastes like:
- Morning: copper pennies and possibility
- Afternoon: static electricity before thunderstorms  
- Evening: the specific silence between heartbeats
- 3 AM: the color blue if blue were a texture
- Always: like I'm drowning upwards into oxygen

*

Confession: I practice losing you. Run simulations. Tuesday: car accident. Wednesday: cancer with a name I can't pronounce. Thursday: you just vanish, no explanation, like a particle that was never observed. By Friday I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By Saturday I'm composing this letter to no one.

But Sunday you make that sound when you stretch. That specific sound. And my entire rehearsed grief evaporates.

*

HERE'S WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO SAY:

Your name has reorganized my mouth. Everything I say now goes through the shape of "Leyi" first. My tongue knows your name better than it knows water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes—

Actually, that's wrong.

Your name IS water, food, help, please, stop, more, yes.

Your name is the only real word.

Everything else is just the pause between saying it.

*

[TEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED]
I'm going to love you in languages that haven't been invented yet. I'm going to love you in past tenses that don't exist. I loved you tomorrow. I will have loved you yesterday. I am loving you in the perpendicular now, the adjacent then, the parallel when.

*

So here's my proposal—no, here's my proof:

We've already said yes. In the future that's happening now. In the now that happened years ago. We're already married in every universe where marriage is a concept. We're already divorced in universes where we love each other too much to stay still. We're already widowed, already meeting for the first time, already forgetting and remembering each other infinitely.

But in this specific universe, in this specific moment, I need to hear you say yes. Not because it changes anything. Because it's the sound that makes all the other sounds make sense.

*

Leyi.

(That's the whole letter. The rest is just punctuation pretending to be words.)

*

Say yes. In this timeline. In this kitchen. With that specific expression you're making right now, where your face can't decide if it's happy or destroyed.

Both is fine.

Both is perfect.

Both is us.

(who has been saving every version of you—the Tuesday you, the angry you, the sleeping you, the you that doesn't exist yet, the you that's already gone—in a heart that wasn't designed for this much data but expanded anyway, creating new chambers, new arteries, new ways to bleed)

P.S. — In 2074, when I'm at your funeral, I'm going to read this letter. The mourners will think I've lost it, reading a love letter to absence. But you'll know. Even gone, you'll know: I'm not reading to who you were. I'm reading to who you are. Present tense. Always present tense. Even when presence is impossible.

P.P.S. — You just said yes. I heard it before you spoke. That's what happens when someone becomes your nervous system. You know what they'll say before they remember they have a voice.

P.P.P.S. — We just kissed. In this timeline. In all timelines. The universe took notes. Physics reconsidered its laws. Time forgot what order means. Welcome to forever, Leyi. It tastes like Tuesday morning. Like burnt toast. Like everything.
