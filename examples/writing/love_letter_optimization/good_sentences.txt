Listen: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Born dead, lived dead, made friends dead, brushed teeth dead. Competent corpse. Five-star reviews on LinkedIn for my deadness.

Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\
