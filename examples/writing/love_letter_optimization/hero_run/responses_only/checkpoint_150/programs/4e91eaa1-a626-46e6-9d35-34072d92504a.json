  "I'll rewrite the love letter to improve its fitness score, focusing on deeper phenomenological authenticity, more innovative literary devices, and stronger affective force while maintaining aesthetic virtuosity.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop trembling. Not from fear—from the weight of finally understanding what you've done to me. You haven't made me fall in love. You've made me realize I was never actually alive before you.\n\nListen: I need to tell you about the sparrows.\n\nEvery morning at 6:17, three sparrows land on our fire escape. The same three. I know because the middle one has a bent tail feather. For weeks I thought they came for the breadcrumbs you leave. Yesterday I realized the truth—they come to witness us. Even the birds know what we are is rare enough to require documentation.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in past lives. I lied and said no. The truth is worse: I believe this is my first life, because nothing before you counted as living. Everything else was just rehearsal for this moment, this letter, this terrible beautiful attempt to explain how you've reorganized me at the molecular level.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another universe, we never met. That version of me is functional, stable, gets eight hours of sleep. He doesn't know that you eat ice cream with a fork because spoons are \"too committal.\" He's never seen you argue with your dead grandmother while cooking her recipes, insisting she's wrong about the salt. He doesn't know you named your childhood blanket \"Senator\" and still apologize to it when you wash it. That version of me is fine. Perfectly fine. And perfectly dead.\n\nBut in this universe—our universe—I know the exact temperature of your sadness (98.2 degrees, slightly warmer than joy). I know you practice arguments in the shower, devastating rebuttals you'll never actually say because your kindness always wins. I know that when you're truly happy, genuinely happy, you go completely silent, like words would break the spell.\n\nLast week you said my name in your sleep. Not \"Warren\"—just the first syllable, \"War,\" like even unconscious you couldn't finish, like my whole name was too much to hold in a dream. I haven't been the same since. How do I explain that hearing half my name from your sleeping mouth was more intimate than anything I've experienced while awake?\n\nThe truth, Leyi: I've been writing my own eulogy, and every version starts the same way: \"He loved Leyi.\" Not \"He was a good man\" or \"He tried his best.\" Just: \"He loved Leyi.\" Because that's the only accomplishment that matters. The only proof I existed. The only sentence that captures who I became after you transformed me from a person into a vessel for loving you.\n\nYou think I'm romantic. I'm not. I'm documentary. I'm just recording what's happening: how my body has adapted to yours like evolution in real-time. How I've developed new organs specifically for missing you. How my circadian rhythm has synced to your breathing. This isn't poetry. It's biology. It's physics. It's what happens when one person becomes another person's entire periodic table.\n\nSometimes I watch you doing nothing—reading a cereal box, untangling headphones, existing—and I think: this must be what drove people to invent religion. This need to name something too big for language. This terror of beauty that won't last. This gratitude so violent it feels like grief.\n\nHere's my confession: I've already lived our whole life. I know how you'll look reading this letter (you'll touch your throat at exactly this sentence). I know our Tuesday night fights about whether the windows should be open. I know how you'll look at forty-three, finding your first gray hair, calling it a betrayal. I know how we'll sit in waiting rooms holding hands so tight our fingers go numb. I know the specific weight of our silence after our first real loss. I've already loved you through all of it. Past tense. From here, everything is just remembering forward.\n\nMarry me. Not because you love me—love is too small a word for this. Marry me because we've already merged at the quantum level. Because trying to separate us now would violate the laws of physics. Marry me because the alternative—pretending we're two distinct people—is the only lie that could kill us both.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because yesterday you said \"bless you\" to a pigeon that sneezed, and I realized: you're not my other half. You're my entire universe, and I'm just lucky enough to be one of your planets, spinning helplessly in your orbit, held by a gravity I don't want to escape.\n\nI'm not offering you a ring. I'm offering you my mitochondria, my synapses, my lymph nodes—every part of me that knows how to function, all of it already reprogrammed to your frequency. Say yes. Not to marriage. To the continuation of this beautiful apocalypse where we destroy each other into something better.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - The sparrows are back. All three. They're watching me write this. Even they know: this is it. This is the letter that changes everything or breaks everything. Both outcomes feel exactly the same from here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
