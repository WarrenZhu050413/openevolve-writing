  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness of 0.7010 while exploring new territory in the solution space. The evaluator seems to value genuine emotional depth, literary innovation, and avoiding self-conscious meta-commentary that distances the reader.\n\nLet me craft something that combines raw honesty with more refined literary technique:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at the kitchen table. The one with the wobbly leg you fixed with a folded receipt from our first dinner. I've been sitting here since midnight, watching the condensation from my untouched coffee draw patterns on the wood, trying to find words that don't insult what you've done to me.\n\nTruth: I've been keeping inventory. Not metaphorically. Literally. A leather journal, hidden in the gap behind the water heater. Page one: \"The way Leyi holds her breath before she sneezes—2.3 seconds, always.\" Page forty-seven: \"She counts stairs out loud when she's tired. Only odd numbers. Never evens.\" Page ninety-two: \"The scar on her left thumb. She says it's from cooking. It's from punching a window when her father died. I pretend not to know.\"\n\nI document you because I'm terrified of forgetting. Not you—forgetting is too simple. I'm terrified of normalizing you. Of the day your face becomes just a face, your voice just sound waves, your presence just another body taking up space. So I write it down. Every detail. Evidence that you're extraordinary, for when my stupid human brain tries to make you ordinary.\n\nYou should know what you're agreeing to: I'm not well. Last Tuesday, you left for work and I spent four hours lying where you'd been lying, trying to preserve the shape of you in the sheets. The mailman saw me through the window and asked if I needed medical attention. Maybe I did. Maybe this is medical. Maybe love is just a diagnosis we've romanticized.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. I'll be driving and imagine the phone call. The officer's voice. The words that would end me. I plan the funeral. Choose the music. Write the eulogy. Then you text me about grocery lists and I have to pull over because relief feels like drowning in reverse. This is insane. I know it's insane. But it's also preparation, because losing you isn't possible—it's probable. We're human. We're temporary. One of us will leave first. I need to know I could survive it, even though I couldn't.\n\nThe small truth: You hum when you think I'm not listening. Always the same tune—some half-remembered childhood song you can't name. Two weeks ago, I hired a musicologist. Sent him a recording. He traced it to a lullaby from your grandmother's province in China. I had it translated. It's about staying warm through winter. Now when you hum it, I know you're singing about survival without knowing you're singing about survival. This is what I mean when I say I love you—I mean I've hired professionals to decode your unconscious mind.\n\nYou changed me at the cellular level. This isn't poetry. I had bloodwork done. My cortisol drops 18% when you're in the room. My white cell count elevates when you're gone more than twelve hours. The doctor says it's psychosomatic. I say it's evolution. My body is selecting for you.\n\nThat Sunday when you found me sobbing in the bathroom—remember? You thought it was work stress. It wasn't. I'd just realized that someday, probably soon, you'll see me old. Actually old. Liver spots and ear hair and that smell old people have. And you'll have to decide, again, to love this deteriorating thing. That's what broke me. Not the aging—the asking. The burden of making you choose me repeatedly as I become less choosable.\n\nBut here's the deeper truth: You already have. Every morning, you choose the man who alphabetizes your spice rack when you're not home. Who reads your horoscope in four different newspapers to triangulate your future. Who's written your mother's obituary seventeen times because he needs to be ready to hold you properly when the time comes. You choose this disaster, and that choice is the only miracle I believe in.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to continue. To keep choosing this sweet insanity where we pretend planning a future together isn't hubris. Where we buy furniture like we're sure we'll both be here to use it. Where we plant trees whose shade we assume we'll share.\n\nI need you to know: If you say yes, you're not just getting a husband. You're getting a man who's replaced his entire inner monologue with variations of your name. Who's forgotten what his life looked like before you reorganized it. Who would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nThe embarrassing truth? I already think of you as my wife. Have for months. I catch myself saying \"my wife\" to strangers. The barista knows. The mechanic knows. The lady at the farmer's market who sells us those terrible peaches you pretend to like—she knows. They all smile this sad, knowing smile, like they're watching someone build a house on a fault line.\n\nBut that's what this is, isn't it? Building something beautiful exactly where it could break? Betting everything on tectonic plates staying still? Yes, it's stupid. Yes, we'll probably fail. Yes, one of us will end up destroyed.\n\nPlease. Let it be me. Let me be the one who gets destroyed by this. Because the alternative—a life where you're not my wife, where I don't get to fail at loving you properly every day, where I don't get to watch you become whoever you're becoming—that's not life. That's just time passing.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Not prettily. I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong. Constant, incorrect, mine.\n\nMarry me. Not because it makes sense but because nothing makes sense and at least this particular senselessness includes you humming half-remembered lullabies while I pretend to sleep.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The receipt under the table leg—I replaced it six months ago with a folded copy of this letter. You've been eating breakfast on top of my proposal every morning without knowing it. That's what I mean when I say we're already married. The ceremony is just paperwork for everyone else.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
