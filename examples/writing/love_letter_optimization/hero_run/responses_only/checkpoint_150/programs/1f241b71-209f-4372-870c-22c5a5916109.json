  "Looking at the evolution history and the current declining fitness (0.7320 → 0.6420), I need to return to what worked best while pushing into new territory. The top-performing letters succeeded through raw specificity, concrete details, and a balance of intellectual vulnerability with embodied experience. The current version has become too abstract and lost the visceral immediacy.\n\nLet me craft something that combines the best elements - the breath-counting intimacy, the grocery receipt urgency, the eating-paper desperation - while exploring new psychological depths:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the kitchen at 3:47 AM. You're asleep upstairs, one leg kicked free of the blankets, making that small sound that isn't quite a snore but I'd testify in court that it is. I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back—Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction—the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children—the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak—are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself—I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains. I already love the way you'll mispronounce \"specifically\" when you tell this story later. I already love everything that hasn't happened yet, because it will happen with you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
