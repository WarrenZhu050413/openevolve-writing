  "Looking at the performance history and current program, I can see the fitness has dropped significantly from 0.73+ to 0.24. The current letter is too brief and generic compared to the successful attempts. The top-performing programs all share certain qualities: specific intimate details, vulnerable confessions, unique metaphors, and a raw emotional authenticity that transcends typical love letter conventions.\n\nLet me write a new letter that aims to recapture and exceed that 0.73+ score by combining the most effective elements from the successful attempts while introducing fresh perspectives:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:17 AM in the bathroom because you're asleep and I can't risk waking you to get the good paper. My hand is cramping from balancing this on my knee. The cat is staring at me like I've lost my mind. She's probably right.\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's mine: I've been documenting the disaster you've made of me. Tuesday: cried during your voicemail about grocery lists. Wednesday: told my code rubber duck about your laugh for forty minutes. Thursday: ate lunch at 3 PM because I was calculating how many times you've said my name (2,847, roughly). Friday: bought six boxes of your cereal because what if they discontinue it and you're sad? This is what you've reduced me to—a man who hoards breakfast foods against hypothetical sorrows.\n\nI know the exact temperature you like your coffee (147°F, I use a thermometer now). I know you cry during the credit sequences of movies, not the sad parts, because \"all those people worked so hard and no one reads their names.\" I know you've been secretly teaching yourself Mandarin on an app at 2 AM when you think I'm sleeping, whispering \"xiǎo māo\" (small cat) over and over like an incantation. I pretend to sleep because your secret dedication to surprising my grandmother makes my chest feel like it's full of bees.\n\nBefore you, I understood cause and effect. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically addicted to someone's presence\" at 3 AM. The search results say no. My body violently disagrees. When you leave for work, my skin feels wrong for exactly 23 minutes. I've timed it. Multiple times. This is not poetry. This is data.\n\nRemember last month when you got that terrible haircut and cried for two hours? You looked like a beautiful dandelion that had been through a wind tunnel. I would have married you right there in that salon chair, surrounded by your fallen hair like some kind of bizarre wedding confetti. That's when I knew I was beyond saving—when your worst moment became my favorite because I got to be there for it.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've already planned our entire life. Not the big things—those are negotiable. The small ones. Sunday crosswords where you get all the pop culture clues I miss. The way you'll steal my reading glasses when you lose yours (you will lose yours). How we'll fight about the thermostat for forty years and I'll secretly adjust it when you're not looking and you'll secretly adjust it back and we'll both know and pretend we don't. The jar of your grandmother's pickled radishes I'll keep buying even after you admit you hate them, because the ritual of checking if we need more has become sacred.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for four months. It lived in my sock drawer, then my glove compartment, then my laptop bag. Now it's in my pocket always, because what if the perfect moment arrives and I'm unprepared? Except the perfect moment was that Tuesday you sneezed spaghetti sauce on my dissertation notes and we laughed until we couldn't breathe. Every moment since has been equally perfect and I'm drowning in opportunity.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, you could destroy me. You probably will. One day you'll realize you could have anyone—someone who doesn't inventory your sighs, who doesn't practice his proposal to the bathroom mirror, who doesn't love you with the graceless desperation of someone who never expected to be chosen. But until that day, I'm going to love you with such catastrophic intensity that archaeological excavations will find evidence of it centuries from now. They'll carbon date my devotion and conclude it was excessive for the era.\n\nI used to have thoughts that weren't about you. Theoretically, those thoughts must have existed. I have no evidence of them now. My brain has been reformatted. You're the operating system everything else runs on. When I debug code, I hear your voice saying \"did you check for semicolons?\" When I make coffee, my hands automatically reach for your mug first. When I breathe, I'm just collecting oxygen to say your name with.\n\nSo here, on this bathroom floor, with my foot falling asleep and the cat now actively judging my life choices, I'm asking you to marry me. Not the man I'll become or the man I should be, but this current disaster who writes love letters on toilet paper because he couldn't wait for morning. Who has seventeen drafts of wedding vows hidden in a encrypted folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Who would rather die choking on these words than live another day pretending he's not already completely, molecularly, irrevocably yours.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent hurricane, you beautiful malfunction in my careful programming—I'm not proposing. I'm surrendering. I've already been conquered. This is just the peace treaty.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I've already rewritten my source code around your existence. There's no rolling back this update.\n\nYours in every timeline where love makes people act this stupid,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you stirring. In twelve seconds you'll shuffle to the bathroom and find me here, surrounded by drafts, crying over my phone's notes app. You'll ask if I'm okay. I'll hand you this letter instead of answering. You'll read it sitting on the edge of the bathtub, and you'll cry at the part about your grandmother, because you always cry about your grandmother. I already love those future tears. I already love the way you'll say yes while calling me an idiot. I already love our entire ridiculous future. It starts now.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
