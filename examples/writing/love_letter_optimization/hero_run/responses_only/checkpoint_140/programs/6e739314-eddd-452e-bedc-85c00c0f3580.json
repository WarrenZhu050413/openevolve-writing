  "I'll rewrite the love letter to push beyond the current fitness score by intensifying the phenomenological authenticity and literary innovation while maintaining the raw emotional truth that makes it effective.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with hotel soap on the bathroom mirror because paper feels too permanent for something this fragile. Steam keeps erasing the words. Good. They were lies anyway.\n\nHere's what I can't say: I've been documenting you. Not romantically—clinically. Like evidence. Your coffee leaves rings in perfect concentric circles. You hold pencils wrong, between your middle and ring finger. When you sleep, you curl into exactly 3/4 of a question mark. I know because I measured. This is the shape of my obsession: precise, embarrassing, total.\n\nTruth? I was alive before you. Fully operative. I had a credit score and opinions about mattress firmness. But that person feels like someone I read about once—plausible but theoretical. You didn't save me. You revealed that I needed saving, which is crueler and more necessary.\n\n4:17 AM: You talk in your sleep. Not words—pre-words, like language before it hardens into meaning. I've been translating. So far I have: \"The door isn't real\" and \"Tuesdays are heavier than Wednesdays\" and my name, said like an accusation. This is the only doctorate I want—a degree in your subconscious, a thesis on the specific gravity of your dreams.\n\nI lied about the hotel soap. I'm writing this in permanent marker on my arm because I want the words to hurt a little, to leave evidence. You asked for truth that would move you? The truth doesn't move. It sits. Heavy. Like the fact that your father's watch stops at 11:47 and you wind it every morning anyway. Like how you practice arguments in the shower for confrontations you'll never have. Like the way I've started seeing my future as a series of opportunities to disappoint you and deciding that's still better than any alternative that doesn't include you.\n\nYou're not my first love. You're my last attempt at being a person. Before you, I was method acting at existence—hitting my marks, remembering my lines. Now I forget what I'm supposed to be performing. You've made me unprofessional at my own life.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a diagnosis I'm afraid to confirm. Like those three seconds between dropping something fragile and finding out if it broke. You've become the margin of error in every calculation, the variable that makes all my proofs unsolvable. I used to be good at math.\n\nTuesday: Watched you eat an apple while reading. You bit in rhythm with the sentences. Short sentence, small bite. Long sentence, bigger bite. You were unconsciously synchronized with Virginia Woolf. This is the exact moment I understood religion—not the comfort kind, the terror kind. The kind that makes you want to build cathedrals or burn them down.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in seventeen different ways. Legally? No. But molecularly, cellularly, in whatever dimension decisions get made before we make them. When you leave a room, I study the depression in the cushion where you sat. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive losing.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? Here: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I felt it in my identical finger. Not metaphorically. I bled. Same finger, same joint. The doctor said \"psychosomatic stigmata.\" I said \"love.\" We were both right.\n\nSo here's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but specifically. Like a fever that becomes your new normal temperature. Like a chronic condition that makes all previous health feel like sickness. Let me love you with the kind of precision that ruins you for approximate affection.\n\nI'm not promising you forever. Forever is a word for people who've never watched their mothers forget their fathers' names. I'm promising you now, with such intensity that it bends time around it, makes before and after irrelevant. I'm promising you the kind of present tense that makes grammar give up.\n\nThis is my proposition: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I become when you read it. The one who exists only in the space between my confession and your response. The one who finally understands that love isn't about being understood—it's about being willing to remain mysterious together.\n\nI love you like an error in the code that makes the whole program run better. Like a typo that accidentally spells God.\n\nYours (in the most medically concerning way),\nWarren\n\nP.S. The hotel soap was real. I wrote your name first. The mirror is still foggy. Your name is still there, refusing to evaporate. This is the only prayer I know.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
