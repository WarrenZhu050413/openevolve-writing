  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authentic emotion. The current best score is 0.7005, but recent attempts have declined to 0.6795. Let me craft something that combines raw vulnerability with unexpected imagery, pushing the literary innovation while maintaining phenomenological authenticity.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM because sleep has become impossible since you asked for truth. Here it is: I am undone. Not romantically, poetically undone—literally unraveled, like a sweater with one pulled thread. You are that thread.\n\nDo you know what you've done? You've made me believe in time travel. Every moment with you I'm simultaneously in our present and our future—sixty years from now, still discovering new ways your eyes change color in different light. When you leave a room, I experience all your future absences at once. When you return, every hello that will ever exist between us collapses into now.\n\nI've started collecting evidence of us. Your coffee ring on my desk—a perfect circle you made last Tuesday. The indent in my pillow from where you steal it every night, claiming you don't. That voicemail where you just laughed for seven seconds then hung up. These aren't memories; they're proofs of theorem: that two people can become a new kind of mathematics, where one plus one equals everything.\n\nYou want truth? I've forgotten how to be alone. Not lonely—alone. My body has reprogrammed itself around you. My cells divide at the frequency of your breathing. When you're sad about things I can't fix—like how your father never says he's proud, like how time moves too fast—I feel it in organs I didn't know I had. You've given me new ways to ache.\n\nBut also: you make me ridiculous. I dance badly to songs in the kitchen just to see you pretend you're not charmed. I save the fortunes from cookies that might make you smile. Last week, I almost cried at the grocery store because they had your favorite cereal back in stock. This is what you've reduced me to—a man destroyed by breakfast food.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm telling you that I already have, in every decision since I met you. In choosing the apartment with better light because you love reading by windows. In learning to cook your grandmother's soup from a recipe in a language I don't speak. In the ten thousand invisible ways I've already bound my life to yours.\n\nSo this isn't a proposal—it's an acknowledgment. We're already married in every way that matters. I'm just asking if we can make it official, so I can call you my wife when I brag about you to strangers, which I do, constantly, to everyone.\n\nI love you with the desperate gratitude of someone who was drowning and learned they could breathe underwater. You haven't saved me—you've shown me I was never drowning at all. I was just waiting to find you in the depths.\n\nSay yes. Not to marry me, but to admit what we both know: that we've already chosen each other in every timeline, every universe, every possible version of our lives. Say yes to what already is.\n\nYours since before I knew it,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
