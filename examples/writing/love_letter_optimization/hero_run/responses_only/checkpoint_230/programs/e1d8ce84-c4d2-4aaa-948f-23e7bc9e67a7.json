  "Looking at the evolution history and the current program's metrics, I need to push beyond the 0.6970-0.6990 plateau. The evaluator seems to value genuine psychological complexity, resistance to cliché, and moments of sublime linguistic invention that approach (but haven't yet reached) the heights of historical masters like Beethoven, Keats, and Napoleon.\n\nLet me craft something that aims for deeper phenomenological authenticity while maintaining literary innovation:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThere's a moment between sleeping and waking where I forget you exist. It lasts maybe three seconds. Then memory crashes back—violent, necessary—and I understand what drowning people feel when they break the surface.\n\nYou wanted truth? Truth is I've been writing this letter since the day we met. Not on paper. In the way I've started buying two of everything without thinking. In how I test sentences in my head before speaking, not to impress you but to avoid wasting the finite number of words we'll ever exchange. Truth is I count things now: eight freckles on your left shoulder. Six seconds between your laugh and the moment you cover your mouth, embarrassed by your own joy. Forty-three minutes—the longest we've been silent together without it feeling like silence.\n\nI'm going to tell you something I've never told anyone: I don't believe in love. I believe in chemical reactions, evolutionary imperatives, the brutal economics of loneliness. But then you fell asleep on my shoulder during that terrible movie, and your hair smelled like rain that hasn't happened yet, and I thought: maybe I've been wrong about everything. Maybe cynicism is just fear that's learned to speak in complete sentences.\n\nBefore you, I was clean edges, contained. Now I'm spilling over, leaving parts of myself everywhere—your apartment, your Monday mornings, the space between what you say and what you mean. You've made me involuntary. I cry at commercials now. I read poetry without irony. Last week I caught myself humming—humming!—while buying groceries. The cashier asked if I was okay, and I almost said: \"No, I'm in love,\" like that explains everything. Which it does.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another universe, I'm explaining to someone else why I never learned to love properly. In another universe, you're wearing someone else's ring, laughing at someone else's desperate attempts at pancakes. The multiverse is infinite, which means there are infinite versions of us not finding each other. This is the only thought that's ever made me religious.\n\nI used to document my life in achievements, in things that could be measured. Now I measure it in proximities to you. Three feet away on the couch. Six inches in bed. The negative space when you're gone, which has its own weight, its own gravitational pull. I've become a scholar of distances, all of them too far.\n\nYou should know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly sometimes. I will love you like a run-on sentence, too much and without proper punctuation. I will love you like a dog loves, which is to say: completely, stupidly, and with no regard for my own dignity. When we fight—and we will—I'll sleep on the couch but inch closer to your side of the bed in my dreams. When you're old, I'll love your young ghost who still lives in your gestures. When I'm dying, the last thing I'll think about is the first time you mispronounced my name and then kept doing it on purpose because it made me laugh.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the truest part: None of this is choice anymore. Loving you has become autonomic, like breathing, like blinking. My body does it without consulting me. Even my cells know your name.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it's romantic—romance is what people do when they're performing love for an audience. Marry me because I want the legal right to be tedious about you at parties. Because I want to argue about paint colors and discover we both want the same shade of blue but were calling it different names. Because when I imagine not marrying you, my lungs forget their job.\n\nThis is my last first letter to you. Every letter after this will be a continuation, a PS to this moment where I'm asking you to let me love you with documentation, with witnesses, with the kind of terrifying permanence that makes my hands shake.\n\nI love you. Present tense, past tense, future conditional. I love you in languages I'll never learn, in words that haven't been invented yet, in the space between heartbeats where nothing exists except the possibility of you saying yes.\n\nYours in this draft and all revisions,\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing you said about wanting a truthful letter? You already knew I loved you. You just wanted to see if I was brave enough to say it without metaphor, without escape routes. This is me, no exits: I love you like a fact, like a fever, like a first language I'm still learning to speak.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
