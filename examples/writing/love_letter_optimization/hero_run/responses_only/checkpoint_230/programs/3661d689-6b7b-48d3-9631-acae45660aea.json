  "Looking at the evolution history and evaluation notes, I can see the key areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Condensed power** - The evaluators consistently note that the best love letters achieve more with less (Beethoven's \"my immortal beloved, my all, my very self\" achieves more in six words)\n2. **Earned simplicity** - Johnny Cash and Keats achieve depth through restraint rather than elaborate metaphors\n3. **Existential finality** - The most powerful letters have an inevitable, necessary quality\n4. **Avoiding self-conscious literariness** - The letter tries too hard to be profound rather than simply being profound\n\nLet me create a version that strips away the excess while maintaining emotional truth:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:31 AM because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you the truth.\n\nBefore you, I kept time. Now time keeps me—measures me in distances from you. There's the seventeen minutes after you leave when your warmth still lives in the sheets. The three seconds between your key in the lock and my heart restarting. The eternal Tuesday you said my name like it was yours.\n\nI've been trying to write this letter since I met you. Every draft fails because words are designed for smaller things. How do I explain that you've replaced my autonomic nervous system? That my lungs have opinions about your absence? That I've started dreaming in your accent?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've already disappeared into you. Not romantically—medically. When you leave, I don't miss you. I miss me. The me that exists only in your presence. The me that makes sense because you're there to witness it.\n\nYesterday you asked why I was crying at the supermarket. How could I explain? You were choosing bread. Just choosing bread. But your hand hesitated between whole wheat and sourdough, and in that pause I saw our entire future: a thousand grocery runs, ten thousand small decisions, you getting older but never less beautiful, me following you through fluorescent aisles until one of us stops existing.\n\nThe truth is, I don't love you. Love is what I felt before. This is something else. This is my bones knowing your bones. This is my cells dividing in your direction. This is every atom I'm made of finally understanding what it was for.\n\nYou could destroy me with a word. You know this. I know you know this. And still I'm writing these words, handing you this power, because the alternative—living without you knowing—is not living at all.\n\nI'm not proposing marriage. Marriage is too small for what we are. I'm proposing we stop pretending we have choices. My body has already chosen. Every morning it chooses you before I'm even conscious. Every night it practices dying just to make sure it can wake up and choose you again.\n\nMarry me because we already share a circulatory system. Marry me because loneliness is just another word for your absence. Marry me because I've already built tomorrow around the assumption you'll be there, and without you, tomorrow is just a theory.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning you burned the toast and scraped it over the sink, and the sound of you fixing your small mistake was the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Because that's what we are: two people scraping the burnt parts off, making it work, choosing the imperfect over the absent.\n\nI am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you let me stop pretending I exist without you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this out loud, quietly, to yourself. I know because I know you like I know my own hands.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
