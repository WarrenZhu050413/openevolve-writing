  "Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see the fitness has declined from 0.7440 to 0.6870. The evaluator seems to value specific, granular details over abstract metaphors, and rewards psychological complexity combined with domestic authenticity. Let me craft a new version that combines the best elements from successful attempts while introducing fresh material.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:47 AM on our kitchen table. The one with the coffee ring you apologized for making three months ago. I've been protecting that stain—moving placemats to avoid it, redirecting cleaning attempts. It's evidence you existed in my space before it became ours.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been documenting you. Not romantically. Compulsively. Like a scientist who's discovered a new species. Your coffee ratio: 2.5 sugars. Never 2, never 3. You test the temperature with your pinkie first. You read the last page of books when anxious. You still text your dead friend Sarah when good things happen—I've seen the messages pile up, unanswered. You think I don't know. I know everything. I know you carry her last birthday card in your wallet behind the expired gym membership you're \"definitely going to use.\"\n\nLast Tuesday you said, \"I don't think I'm built for happiness. I think I'm built for wondering about happiness.\" You were eating cereal for dinner, specifically Froot Loops, systematically by color—red first, always red first. That's when I understood: you're not broken. You're just assembled in a different order than the manual suggests. And I want the warranty on whatever beautiful malfunction made you.\n\nHere's data you should have: My therapist thinks I'm anxiously attached. She's wrong. I'm Leyi-attached. It's a different pathology entirely. Symptoms include: keeping your grocery lists because your handwriting looks hopeful, practicing conversations with you while I shower, and this thing where my cells literally reorganize when you enter a room—I can feel them pivot toward you like sunflowers following light.\n\nThe truth about that night your mother called you a disappointment: You didn't hang up. You listened to all forty-three minutes of her listing your failures while you organized my sock drawer by gradient. Black to grey to white. Then you made us grilled cheese at 1 AM and said, \"At least I'm good at cheese.\" You're not just good at cheese, Leyi. You're good at surviving yourself.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I'm furious that you existed for twenty-seven years without me. All those breakfasts you ate alone. Those Sunday afternoons you filled with other people's voices. Those 3 AMs when you couldn't sleep and I wasn't there to not-sleep with you. I want retroactive ownership of your past. I want to have been there when you learned to ride a bike, when you got your period, when your goldfish died and you held a funeral with full liturgy. I want all of it. The greed is cellular.\n\nBut I also know this: The you I love is made of all those moments I missed. You're a collection of experiences I'll never fully access, and that's what makes you Leyi instead of just an extension of my wanting. You're whole. You were whole before me. You'll be whole after me. The miracle is that you choose to be whole *with* me.\n\nThree weeks ago, you had that nightmare—the one where everyone you love is in a burning building and you can only save one person. You woke up sobbing, apologizing for not choosing me in a dream. Leyi. Listen. I don't need you to save me. I need you to let me watch you save yourself, over and over, in small ways. Like how you put socks on before pants because \"feet get cold first.\" Like how you thank automatic doors. Like how you've kept that succulent alive for two years even though it's definitely plastic and I replaced it after the real one died in week three.\n\nHere's what marriage actually is: It's Tuesday night and we're too tired to be kind but we try anyway. It's the fight about the dishwasher that's really about my father's death. It's you finding me crying in the car over a song that reminds me of nothing specific, just the general ache of being alive, and you don't ask questions—you just turn the volume up. It's the accumulation of witnessed moments until two people become archeological evidence of each other.\n\nThe ring is my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty-one years. When my grandfather died, she kept making his coffee every morning for three months. \"Muscle memory,\" she said. But I knew better. Love doesn't end just because its object disappears. It continues, stubborn and stupid and sacred, making coffee for ghosts. That's what I'm offering you—love too stupid to stop.\n\nI'm not promising happiness. Happiness is a teenager's promise. I'm promising something better: recognition. I promise to know you so specifically that when you change—and you will change—I'll recognize the new you as still you. I promise to update my understanding daily. To notice when you switch from red Froot Loops first to yellow. To care about that switch. To ask why. To accept \"no reason\" as a complete answer.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical me who writes pretty letters at dawn. The actual me who leaves cabinet doors open and folds fitted sheets into shameful balls. The me who practiced this proposal on Gerald (yes, I know about Gerald, and yes, I know she's female—the abdomen gives it away—but your secret is safe). The me who loves you with the kind of granular attention that other people call creepy but you call Tuesday.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, but I don't have poetry. I have data. I have evidence. I have the recorded history of us: Every Wednesday you wear the same green shirt. You've cried at every Pixar movie including the lamp intro. You can't whistle but you try when you're nervous. You apologize to furniture you bump into. You still have the ticket stub from our first movie—the one we walked out of because the popcorn was better than the plot.\n\nThis is my testimony: You are the most specific person I've ever loved. Not special—specific. Special implies comparison. You're incomparable. You're Leyi who eats pizza crust-first and saves fortunes from cookies you don't eat and who once spent three hours teaching a stranger's kid to tie shoes in an airport because you couldn't bear to see him struggle.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the daily practice of us. To the nineteen thousand more breakfasts if we're lucky. To the specific way we'll age into people we don't recognize but somehow still choose. Say yes to Tuesday. To every Tuesday. To the most ordinary possible love that becomes, through repetition and attention, sacred.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing you do where you whisper \"goodbye house\" every time we leave? I've started doing it when you're not there. The house seems to appreciate it. Or maybe I just appreciate any ritual that assumes we're coming back. Both feel like prayer.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
