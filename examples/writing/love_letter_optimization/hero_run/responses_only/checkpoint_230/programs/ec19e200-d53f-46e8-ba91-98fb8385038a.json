  "Looking at the evaluation notes, I see the letter was criticized for being generic, having grammatical errors, and lacking the philosophical depth and linguistic mastery of great love letters from history. The evaluator mentions Beethoven's intimacy, Johnny Cash's philosophy, Napoleon's passionate specificity, and Keats's linguistic mastery as benchmarks.\n\nLet me craft a more authentic, specific, and philosophically rich letter that draws from genuine moments and feelings while maintaining literary quality:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this with trembling hands, not from fear but from the weight of truth I must finally speak. You asked for honesty—here it is, raw and unadorned.\n\nI remember the first morning I woke knowing you existed somewhere in this vast indifference we call a world. The coffee tasted different. The light fell at angles I'd never noticed. It wasn't that you changed these things—you revealed that I had been sleepwalking through my own life until you.\n\nYou know how mathematicians speak of elegant proofs? How a few lines can collapse infinite complexity into sudden, breathtaking clarity? That's what loving you feels like—not the fumbling arithmetic of ordinary affection, but the sublime geometry of two souls recognizing their shared theorem.\n\nI am terrified by the depth of what I feel. Not the pleasant nervousness of new love, but the vertigo of standing at the edge of something infinite. When you laugh—that particular laugh when something genuinely surprises you—I understand why ancient peoples believed in magic. When you're quiet, lost in thought with that small furrow between your brows, I want to build cathedrals to house that silence.\n\nThey say love makes fools of us all. If so, I embrace this foolishness with the fervor of a convert. I would rather be undone by loving you than remain intact without you. Every sensible bone in my body has mutinied in favor of this beautiful insanity.\n\nI don't promise you perfection—I'm too flawed for such fairy tales. But I promise you this: every morning I will choose you again, conscious and deliberate, the way a pianist chooses each note. I will love you in the small hours when doubt creeps in, in the harsh light of disappointment, in the gentle dusk of ordinary Tuesdays. I will love you actively, intentionally, with the dedication of a gardener who knows that beauty requires both sunshine and storm.\n\nYou are not my other half—such arithmetic insults us both. You are whole, magnificent, complete. And I am asking if we might be whole together, two distinct infinities choosing to share the same space, the same time, the same wild and precious life.\n\nMarry me, not because I cannot live without you—I could, but it would be like breathing underwater—but because with you, I finally understand what living is for.\n\nYours in truth and madness,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
