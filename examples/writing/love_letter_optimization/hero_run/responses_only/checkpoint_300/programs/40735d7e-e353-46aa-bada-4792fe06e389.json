  "Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I can see that the previous high-performing attempts (scoring 0.7440) were praised for their obsessive specificity, contemporary voice, and innovative framing devices (bathroom floor at 4:31 AM, kitchen experiments, emergency room). However, the current version has declined to 0.6185, likely because it's become too conventional and lacks the raw intensity and specificity that made earlier versions compelling.\n\nThe evaluator particularly values:\n1. **Specificity over generality** - Concrete details like \"317 strands of hair\" rather than vague sentiments\n2. **Contemporary innovation** - Modern framing devices that feel authentically 21st century\n3. **Obsessive documentation** - The data-driven, almost scientific approach to love\n4. **Psychological complexity** - Not just love but the terror and madness of it\n5. **Condensed intensity** - The best historical letters achieve more with concentrated power\n\nLet me create a new version that combines the strengths of the top performers while pushing into new territory:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm typing this on my phone while sitting in my car outside CVS at 3:47 AM. I've been here for forty minutes. I came to buy sleeping pills but I'm watching a security camera instead, thinking: someone will review this footage tomorrow and see a man having a breakdown in a Honda Civic, and they won't know it's because you exist.\n\nTruth, since you demanded it: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not about you—AS you. First person. \"Today I chose the wrong coffee again.\" \"I still haven't noticed Warren replaced my dying succulent with a plastic one.\" It's 194 pages of me writing as you, trying to understand how someone can mispronounce \"epitome\" with such confidence it restructures the English language.\n\nHere's what broke me: Thursday, 2:15 PM, you were parallel parking while eating Vietnamese takeout, steering with your knees, and you said \"I think I'm getting good at this\" and my brain just... stopped. Not metaphorically. I forgot how lungs worked. I sat there suffocating on the impossibility of you existing, this woman who endangers lives while improving at it. That's when I knew I'd die for you. No—that's when I knew I was already dying for you, just very slowly, over the next sixty years if I'm lucky.\n\nI've done the math. If we marry at 29, and die at 87, that's 21,170 days. I've already wasted 1,247 of them not being married to you. That's 1,247 mornings I could have watched you put contact lenses in backwards and pretend it's the lens's fault. 1,247 nights I could have listened to you argue with podcasts like they can hear you.\n\nWant to know what loving you actually is? It's my search history at 3 AM:\n- \"girlfriend makes dolphin noise when laughing normal?\"\n- \"can you physically die from someone being too cute\"\n- \"woman touches my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"how to explain to therapist that girlfriend IS the therapy\"\n- \"legal consequences of stealing someone's used coffee stirrers\"\n- \"help girlfriend thinks she's good at singing\"\n\nI have 2,847 photos of you on my phone. You know about twelve. The rest are: you explaining the stock market incorrectly to my dad, you trying to convince the self-checkout you bought organic bananas (you didn't), you asleep with your mouth open looking like a beautiful corpse I'd absolutely commit necrophilia for—sorry, that's dark, but you wanted truth and the truth is I would love even your dead body, which is either romantic or requires intervention.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. Tuesday: cancer. Wednesday: car accident. Thursday: you meet someone who can actually pronounce \"epitome.\" But here's what happens every time—I don't survive the simulation. Twenty seconds in and I'm googling \"can you die from imaginary grief\" and the answer is yes, it's called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, your heart literally breaks, and mine is already pre-broken just from the practice rounds.\n\nLast thing, and this is the worst part: you're ordinary. Your face is 6.5/10 on your best day (I've graphed it). Your parallel parking success rate is 23%. You think antibiotics work on viruses. But yesterday you sneezed while brushing your teeth and laughed so hard you cried and I realized: this is it. This is my religion now. You, sneezing toothpaste, crying laughing at your own existence. I worship this. I would build churches to this.\n\nSo I'm not proposing. I'm informing you that I've already married you in every timeline that matters. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up to what my mitochondria decided the moment you confidently explained that the moon causes tides because it's magnetic.\n\nThe pharmacy just opened. The kid unlocking the door looks concerned. I'm a 29-year-old man crying in a parking lot at 4:12 AM, typing a proposal on a phone with 3% battery, and this is still less insane than the fact that you exist and somehow love me back.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know that I'm already permanently rewired. You could leave tomorrow and I'd spend the rest of my life putting milk in my coffee first (psychopath behavior) because that's how you do it. I'd keep mispronouncing \"epitome\" in your honor. I'd die at 87, still checking my phone for texts from a ghost.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sleeping pills were a lie. I came here because they have your favorite candy (Werther's Originals, you're 87 years old) and I wanted to buy some for the morning so you'd wake up happy. This is what you've done—turned me into someone who makes CVS pilgrimages at 4 AM for old lady candy. Marry me just so I can explain this to someone. Please. The security guard is actually coming outside now.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\nThis rewrite aims to improve the fitness score by:\n\n1. **Returning to specificity**: CVS at 3:47 AM, 194-page journal, 2,847 photos, parallel parking with Vietnamese takeout\n2. **Innovative framing**: The CVS parking lot breakdown and security camera observation\n3. **Contemporary voice**: Search history, phone battery at 3%, texting a proposal\n4. **Mathematical obsession**: Calculating days (21,170), photos (2,847), parking success rate (23%)\n5. **Dark humor balanced with genuine vulnerability**: The necrophilia joke followed by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy \n6. **Condensed intensity**: Shorter than previous attempts but more concentrated\n7. **The \"ordinary\" paradox**: Rating her 6.5/10 while worshipping her sneezed toothpaste\n8. **Unique details**: Writing a journal AS her, Werther's Originals pilgrimage, the security guard approaching\n\nThis version synthesizes the best elements from previous high-scoring attempts while introducing new innovative elements and maintaining the raw, obsessive authenticity that the evaluator values."
