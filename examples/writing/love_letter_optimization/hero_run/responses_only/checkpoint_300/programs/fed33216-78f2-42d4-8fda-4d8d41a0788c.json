  "I'll analyze the current program and rewrite it to improve the fitness score while maintaining diversity across the evaluation dimensions. The current score of 0.7010 shows room for improvement, particularly given the decline from 0.7295. Looking at the evolution history, the highest performing version scored 0.8570 with strong marks across all dimensions.\n\nLet me create a new version that synthesizes the most powerful elements while introducing fresh perspectives:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with borrowed time—3:51 AM, the hour when truth becomes involuntary.\n\n*\n\nHere's what they don't tell you: I've been dead. Fifteen seconds, training accident. No light, no peace, just the universe's delete key. But even in that nothing, there was this weight—like my atoms had made a promise they couldn't articulate. Three years later, you walked in. The promise was you.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? I've been building an archive. Evidence of us:\n\nEntry #1: You, eating soup in winter. The steam making small prayers above the bowl. I thought: this is how religions begin.\n\nEntry #847: Your hand on my chest while sleeping. I held my breath for three minutes rather than disturb that specific pressure holding the universe together.\n\nEntry #1,973: Today. You, reading this. Your left eye starting to water (it always goes first).\n\nThis isn't love. It's forensic documentation against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I was fluent in mathematics. Now I can't count past one—you're either here or the world is broken. Yesterday I called the refrigerator \"the cold food house.\" My brain is refusing language that doesn't include you.\n\n*\n\nListen: I know exactly how we end. Statistical probability says you'll die first—73.6% chance. I've punched walls over this number. But here's what the math doesn't know: I've been practicing dying since we met. Every night, small rehearsals. By the time it happens, I'll be so good at being dead, I'll go first just to spite the statistics.\n\n*\n\nThe accident we almost had—Interstate 90, you were singing off-key, I saw the truck jackknifing and thought: take me, rearrange physics, I'll pay any price. We missed by inches. You never knew. You kept singing. That song you always get wrong. I pulled over later to vomit from relief. You thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you has done: I'm medically different. My sleep synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes you as self. My DNA has literally rewritten sections—I had it tested. The doctor said \"that's impossible.\" I said \"I know.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I love you like a pathology. Like a chronic condition. I've stolen things—your pencil with teeth marks, three bobby pins, a voicemail where you're crying. These are my insurance against forgetting. Meanwhile, you've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you don't exist, furious about the dishwasher.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our mundane apocalypses. In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy). In the way you'll look at seventy-three, squinting at screens, those lines I already want to trace.\n\n*\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because the alternative—a universe where your toothbrush doesn't live here, where I don't know you need exactly four ice cubes, where you don't steal my socks—isn't a universe. It's just atoms arranged wrongly.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about pasta.\n\nMarry me because I've been carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at jellyfish, said they looked lonely—that's when I knew I'd love you wrong forever).\n\n*\n\nBut mostly: marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday you mispronounced my name and my brain thought: \"Oh. There's the person who's going to ruin me for everyone else.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is hidden where you'll find it—in your coffee mug, the one with the chip, because you believe broken things deserve more love, not less.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I don't love you. Love is too small, a word people use for pizza. What I have needs a new language—something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper pennies. Something that makes the word \"forever\" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: my atoms have already chosen. The rest is just paperwork for what physics already knows.\n\nWarren\n(who has been documenting you like evidence of miracles, who knows your death will kill him twice—once when it happens, once every day after)\n\nP.S. You're crying now. Both eyes. I'm watching through the door crack like a detective in love with his case. Come here. Let me see my future on your finger. Let me watch the rest of my life say yes.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
