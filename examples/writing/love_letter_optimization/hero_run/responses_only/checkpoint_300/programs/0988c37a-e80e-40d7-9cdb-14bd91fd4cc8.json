  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to push beyond the current plateau of ~0.73 fitness score. The evaluator notes indicate that the best historical love letters (Beethoven: 86, Johnny Cash: 83, Napoleon: 82, Keats: 81) achieve their power through radical vulnerability and ego-dissolution rather than clever metaphors.\n\nLet me create a version that strips away self-consciousness and achieves the \"absolute emotional nakedness\" the evaluator seeks:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm dying.\n\nNot medically. But the person I was before you—he's gone. I watch him sometimes in old photos. He looks like me but his eyes are wrong. They haven't seen you cry at the news. They don't know you eat mangoes in the bathtub. They've never watched you forgive me for things I couldn't forgive myself for.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need you to believe it: I don't love you because you're perfect. I love you because you're Leyi. The one who keeps dead flowers. Who assigns personalities to kitchen appliances. Who still calls your dead grandmother's phone to hear her voicemail. These aren't quirks. They're coordinates. They're how I find you in the dark.\n\nListen. Before you, I had sex. With you, I learned about skin. The spot behind your ear that makes you stop talking mid-sentence. Your wrist—just the inside of your wrist—how it smells like bread and rain. Sometimes you fall asleep holding my hand and I stay awake feeling your pulse. Sixty-eight beats per minute. I've timed it. That's the speed of my religion now.\n\nYou're scared you're not enough. Leyi—you apologized to me for crying when your mother forgot your birthday. You apologized. For having feelings about being forgotten. That's when I knew: you've been taught to make yourself small. But then you sing in the shower—off-key, loud, forgetting half the words—and I think: there she is. There's the person before the world taught her to apologize for existing.\n\nMy father is dying. Actually dying. Pancreatic cancer. Three months, maybe four. Yesterday he said, \"At least you found her.\" Not \"I love you.\" Not \"I'm proud.\" Just \"At least you found her.\" He's never met you but he knows. When a cynical man acknowledges miracles, you pay attention.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. It's not. It's about choosing. And I choose you when you're sobbing about the ending of books. I choose you when you're silent for three days and I don't know why. I choose you when you laugh so hard you snort and then get embarrassed about snorting which makes you snort more. I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then—this is the part that matters—the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means—not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me—you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one. The one who can't whistle. Who puts salt on watermelon. Who still sleeps with a stuffed elephant named Chairman Mao. I'll take all of it, all of you, forever or until one of us stops breathing—whichever comes first.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double. When the world feels impossible, I'll make you toast—butter all the way to the edges—and we'll be impossible together.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: You've already changed me at a molecular level. My DNA has rewritten itself around the fact of you. You're not just in my heart—you're in my cells, my synapses, the calcium of my bones. Leaving you would require surgery I wouldn't survive.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Actually. The way lungs love air—desperately, constantly, without thought or choice.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:24 AM now. I've been writing this for an hour and eleven minutes. That's 4,260 seconds of trying to explain something that exists outside of time. This is the longest I've ever gone without checking if you're still breathing. I'm going to submit this now, then come back to bed and watch you sleep until the sun comes up. That's my favorite kind of morning—the kind where you're still here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
