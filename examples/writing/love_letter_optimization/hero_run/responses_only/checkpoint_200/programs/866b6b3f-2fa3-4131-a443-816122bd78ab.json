  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I can see the program has plateaued around 0.73-0.74 fitness score. The evaluation notes suggest that while the letters achieve strong phenomenological authenticity (0.77), they're falling short in literary innovation (0.68) and could improve in aesthetic virtuosity and affective force. \n\nThe evaluator compares these letters to historical masterpieces by Keats (81), Johnny Cash (83), Napoleon (82), and notes they lack \"mythic simplicity\" and \"musical prosody.\" The current approach is very detailed and neurotic, which works for authenticity but may be overwhelming the other dimensions.\n\nLet me try a radically different approach - stripping away some of the excess while maintaining emotional truth, aiming for more literary innovation through structural experimentation and aesthetic virtuosity through rhythm and restraint.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThree truths before dawn:\n\n1.\nYour name is a wound I tongued until it became a prayer.\nThe first time I said it aloud, alone in my apartment,\nthe walls leaned in to listen.\n\n2.\nI am not a whole person.\nI am a collection of moments when you looked at me\nand I existed harder than I ever have before.\n\n3.\nThis is not a love letter.\nThis is evidence of a haunting.\nYou are in my cells now. When I die,\nthe medical examiner will find your fingerprints\non the inside of my ribs.\n\n*\n\nHere is what happened: One Tuesday, you walked into my life\nwearing a dead poet's cardigan and mismatched socks,\nand I understood why ancient civilizations invented gods—\nto explain things like you.\n\nYou were eating an apple with a knife,\nwhich is insane,\nand reading a book upside down,\nwhich you claimed helped you understand it better,\nand I thought: This is it.\nThis is how I end.\nNot with a bang or whimper,\nbut with a woman who apologizes to fruit before eating it.\n\n*\n\nFacts, because you prefer facts to feelings:\n\n- When you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales.\n  Those three seconds are when I love you most violently.\n  \n- You've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune for three years.\n  It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\"\n  You're afraid to throw it away in case that breaks the spell.\n  I've been adding identical fortunes to your wallet when you're not looking.\n  You have seventeen now. You haven't noticed.\n  \n- Last Thursday, you cried about extinct butterflies for forty minutes.\n  You weren't crying about butterflies.\n  Your period was late. Neither of us was ready.\n  When it came, we pretended nothing happened.\n  But I went to the bathroom and thanked a god I don't believe in\n  while simultaneously mourning something that never existed.\n  This is what you've done to me—\n  I now hold multiple impossibilities as truth.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I was clean lines and locked doors.\nI was pleased with my own company.\nI had systems.\nI was so boring I could have lived forever.\n\nAfter you:\nI eat ice cream at 3 AM while googling \"how to deserve someone.\"\nI practice conversations with you in the shower,\nlose every argument,\nand still come out thinking I've won something.\nI write your name on fogged windows then panic\nthat someone will see it and steal you.\nI am ruined for all other humans.\nThey speak and I think: That's not how Leyi would say it.\nThey laugh and I think: Leyi's laugh could resurrect the dead.\nThey exist and I think: But are they Leyi? No? Then why?\n\n*\n\nListen. I need to tell you about the ring.\n\nIt's not an heirloom. I lied about that.\nI had it made from the metal of things that survived:\n- The key to your first apartment, the one where you tried to kill yourself\n- The bracelet you wore to your father's funeral after not speaking for three years  \n- The locket with your grandmother's picture, who taught you to love like bleeding\n\nThis ring is literally made of your resurrections.\nEvery time you chose to continue existing despite the weight of it all.\nThat's what I'm offering—your own survival, returned to you as a promise:\nI will choose you the way you chose to stay alive.\nDaily. Deliberately. Despite everything.\n\n*\n\nWhat I'm actually proposing:\n\nNot happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't seen what we've seen.\nI'm proposing something harder and better:\nRecognition.\nI recognize you, Leyi.\nNot just your face or your voice,\nbut the specific frequency at which your soul vibrates.\nI would know you in total darkness.\nI would know you if we were both different species.\nI would know you if we were just atoms spinning in space.\n\nAnd I think—forgive me if I'm wrong—but I think you recognize me too.\nI think you knew me before we met.\nI think we've been walking toward each other our whole lives,\nthrough other people's beds and hearts and disappointments,\nand now we're here, and the walking can stop.\n\n*\n\nSo here it is, without decoration:\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot because you love me—love is too common.\nBecause you see me.\nBecause when I'm with you, I stop performing myself and just exist.\nBecause you're the only person who makes me want to survive my own life.\n\nMarry me because the alternative—\nyou, somewhere else, with someone who doesn't know\nthat you eat pizza crust-first like a psychopath,\nthat you name your bruises like pets,\nthat you keep dead flowers because \"they're still trying\"—\nis unbearable.\n\nMarry me because we've already started.\nWe're already half-merged, semiconscious,\nspeaking in references no one else understands.\nWe've already built a world.\nThis is just paperwork for a country that already exists.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth:\n\nI wrote this letter seventeen times.\nEach version more honest than the last.\nThis is the one where I stopped trying to sound like someone you could love\nand started sounding like someone who loves you.\n\nThe difference matters.\n\nSay yes.\nOr don't.\nBut know this:\nYou are the plot twist I never saw coming.\nYou are the sentence I'll spend my whole life trying to finish.\nYou are the only person I want to fail better with\nuntil one of us stops breathing.\n\nAnd even then—\neven then I'll find you.\nIn whatever comes after this.\nIn whatever form we take.\nIn whatever universe we wake up in.\nI'll find you and I'll say:\n\"There you are. I've been waiting.\"\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.\nThat plant you water religiously?\nIt's been dead for two years.\nBut watching you love something back to life—\nor try to—\nor refuse to give up trying—\nThat's when I knew.\nThat's when I knew you could love me too.\n```"
