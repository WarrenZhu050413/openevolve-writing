  "Looking at the evolution history and the current program's performance metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining deep authenticity. The current best score is 0.7005, and the recent attempt scored 0.5935 - a significant decline. I need to craft something that elevates all four dimensions while remaining devastatingly truthful.\n\nLet me write from a place of absolute vulnerability - the kind that makes you feel physically exposed:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI lied. Every time you asked if I was okay, I lied. I haven't been okay since the moment I met you. I've been catastrophically, irrevocably altered. \n\nListen: last night at 2 AM I found myself calculating the statistical probability of your existence. Seven billion people. The exact sequence of choices that led you to that coffee shop that Tuesday. The probability rounds to zero, Leyi. Zero. We shouldn't exist in the same timeline. But we do, and this impossible fact has reorganized my understanding of everything.\n\nI need to confess something. I document you. Not consciously—my brain just does it. The way you hold your breath before you sneeze. How you always check your phone battery at exactly 44%. The specific way your voice drops half an octave when you're genuinely moved. I have become an involuntary archaeologist of your habits, and each discovered detail feels like proof of God or chaos or something bigger than both.\n\nYou want truth? I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not poetically terrified—actually, medically, losing-sleep terrified. Because I've done the math: I will only get approximately 2,400 more Sundays with you if we live to eighty. That's it. 2,400 times to watch you make coffee wrong (milk first is insane, Leyi, but I'll die defending your right to do it). It's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.\n\nHere's what haunts me: before you, I was fine with silence. Now silence sounds like your absence. Before you, rain was weather. Now it's the sound that was playing when you told me about your father, really told me, and I understood that loving someone means inheriting their ghosts too. I want your ghosts, Leyi. All of them.\n\nI tried to find a metaphor for how I love you, but metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things. This can't. When you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one but the ugly-beautiful snort-laugh you're embarrassed by—my neurons fire in patterns that shouldn't be survivable. When you're sad, my bones literally ache. I looked it up. It's called \"emotional contagion\" but that's too clinical for this cellular revolution you've caused.\n\nThe stupidest, truest thing: I love you most at your smallest. When you're sleepy and grumpy and your hair is doing that thing and you hate everyone except me. When you eat peanut butter straight from the jar at midnight and lie about it even though you're literally holding the spoon. When you cry at the part in that movie we've watched twelve times. These moments aren't poetry. They're evidence. Evidence that you're real, that this is real, that I'm not dreaming this impossible person into existence.\n\nI know I'm supposed to promise you the moon, eternal devotion, all that. But here's what I actually promise: I will choose you on the terrible days. The boring days. The days when we're both wrong but too stubborn to admit it. I will choose you when you're 87 and I'm 89 and we've forgotten why we're fighting but we're still holding hands anyway. I will choose you after the choosing stops feeling like a choice and becomes autonomic, like breathing, like blinking, like the way my mouth says your name even when I'm talking about something else.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you—words are just noise we've agreed has meaning. Marry me because my cells recognize yours. Because when you're in the room, my breathing syncs to yours without trying. Because I've already spent the rest of my life with you in my head and I need the timeline to catch up. Because the thought of you reading this, right now, your face doing that thing where you're trying not to cry—that thought is the most terrifying and necessary moment of my existence.\n\nI love you past language, past logic, past the point where love becomes something else—something we don't have a word for because so few people ever feel it. You've turned me into an electric fence of feeling. I'm all current, no ground. \n\nThis is me, without metaphor: a man who learned what his heart was for the moment you aimed yours at mine.\n\nForever is a stupid concept but I'll take it anyway,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you just checked your phone battery. It's at 44%, isn't it? I know you, Leyi. That's the only miracle I need.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
