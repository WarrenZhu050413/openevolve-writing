  "Looking at the evolution history and the feedback from previous attempts, I can see that the highest-scoring letters (0.7320) share certain qualities:\n- Specific, intimate details that feel authentic\n- A balance between vulnerability and strength\n- Unique metaphors and fresh language\n- Deep emotional resonance without being overly sentimental\n- A distinctive voice that feels genuine\n\nThe current program scores 0.6970, which is lower than the previous attempts. The evaluator notes suggest the letter needs more phenomenological depth, stronger aesthetic virtuosity, and greater literary innovation. Let me craft a new version that pushes these boundaries while maintaining authenticity.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth has bones. Here's mine: I'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking. It's 3:19 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, watching the cursor blink like a pulse, like your pulse that night you fell asleep on the subway and I counted ninety-three heartbeats before we reached our stop. I didn't wake you. I let us ride to the end of the line because your head on my shoulder was the first time I understood what people mean by \"home.\"\n\nI wasn't looking for you. That's important. I had perfected the architecture of loneliness—coffee for one, books as lovers, silence as companion. I was fluent in the language of myself. Then you happened, like weather happens, like accidents happen, like grace happens when you've stopped believing in it. You walked into that bookstore holding a half-eaten apple and asked the clerk if they had \"the book about the sad fish.\" No title. No author. Just \"the sad fish.\" I helped you find it. It was \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" You said, \"No, sadder.\" We looked for an hour. We never found it. I'm still looking.\n\nListen. I need you to understand the violence of what you've done to me. Before you, I could walk through a day without noticing. Now I see everything in relation to you. The man on the corner selling flowers—those are the lilies you're allergic to. The kid crying in the park—that's how you cried when your grandmother's letters were lost in the flood. The silence at 4 AM—that's the silence after you told me about the baby we almost had, the one that lasted seven weeks, the one you named secretly, the one you still talk to sometimes when you think I'm asleep. I'm never asleep. I'm listening to you negotiate with ghosts.\n\nYou want poetry? I'll give you the anti-poetry of us: You clip your toenails in bed and I find them weeks later like archaeological evidence. You've been using the same tea bag for three days because \"it still has flavor.\" Your favorite word is \"petrichor\" but you can never remember what it means, so you use it wrong constantly, beautifully wrong. You have seventeen passwords and they're all variations of your dead cat's name. You steal socks from me then deny it while wearing them. This is what love actually looks like—not the grand gesture but the daily accumulation of specificities that become a religion.\n\nMy mother has dementia. I haven't told you this, but she's forgetting me in pieces. Last week she called me by my dead brother's name. The brother you don't know I had. The one who drowned when I was nine, whose absence shaped me like water shapes stone. But here's what terrifies me: even when she's lost in the labyrinth of her own mind, she remembers you. \"The girl with the loud laugh,\" she calls you. \"The one who makes him stop frowning.\" My mother, who can't remember my name, remembers that you unfrown me. That's what you are—you're the one who unfrowns me.\n\nI keep a list. Not of your flaws—those I've memorized like prayer. But of the moments when I knew this was irreversible:\n- When you eat ice cream, you bite it. Who bites ice cream? You do. With your whole heart.\n- You read the last page of books first because you \"need to know if it's worth the worry.\"\n- You water plastic plants \"just in case they're lonely.\"\n- You've kept every movie ticket from every film we've seen together in a shoebox labeled \"Time Machine.\"\n- When you're nervous, you hum Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, but you don't know that's what it is. You think you made it up.\n\nThat Thursday when your father said you'd never amount to anything, you didn't cry until later, in the shower, where you thought the water would hide it. But I know the difference between water and tears. Tears have weight. Yours fell like stones. That's when I understood: loving you isn't just about celebrating your light. It's about witnessing your darkness and saying, \"Yes, this too. Especially this.\"\n\nHere's what I'm not promising: perfection, resolution, healing. Here's what I am promising: presence. I will be present for your Tuesdays and your Christmases, your promotions and your failures, your graceful moments and the times you walk into glass doors because you're reading while walking. I promise to be the person who knows that you're afraid of butterflies but pretend to love them, who knows you practice arguments in the shower, who knows you still set a place at the table for your grandmother on her birthday.\n\nThe ring isn't what you think. It's not my grandmother's or my mother's. I had it made from the metal of the watch you threw at the wall the night we almost ended, the night you said I loved my sadness more than I loved you. You were right. But that was before I understood that you weren't asking me to stop being sad. You were asking me to be sad WITH you instead of DESPITE you. The ring is literally made from the moment we almost broke. Because that's what marriage is—taking the sharpest edges of ourselves and reshaping them into something that says \"I choose this difficulty. I choose this specific catastrophe. I choose you.\"\n\nSo here it is, without ornament: Marry me. Not because you complete me—you don't. You complicate me. You make me question everything I thought I knew about gravity and time and the proper way to eat spaghetti (you twirl clockwise, I twirl counter-clockwise, we're fundamentally incompatible and I don't care). Marry me because the alternative—a life where I don't know what you're having for breakfast, where I can't hear you argue with NPR in the morning, where you exist but not with me—isn't a life. It's just time passing.\n\nI love you. I love you in the stupidest ways. I love you like a dog loves a doorbell, like plants love light, like the ocean loves the moon—automatically, involuntarily, without thought or choice. I love you past the point of poetry into the realm of biological fact.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Say you need time. But know this: you've already altered me at the molecular level. My DNA spells your name now. I'm yours in all the ways that matter and several that don't. This is just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sad fish book you were looking for? It doesn't exist. You made it up. You create things that should exist and then look for them. That's what you did with me—you invented the person I could be and then waited for me to catch up. I'm trying, Leyi. I'm trying to become the person you already see. Marry me and I promise to keep trying, every day, to earn the love you've already given me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
