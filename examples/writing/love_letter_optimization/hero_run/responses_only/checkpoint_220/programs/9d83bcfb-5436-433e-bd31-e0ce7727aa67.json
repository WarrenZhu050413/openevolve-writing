  "I'll rewrite the love letter to improve its fitness score while maintaining the same function signature. Based on the evaluation history, I need to enhance all four dimensions while avoiding the pitfalls of previous attempts.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with your pen. The one with teeth marks. I taste them when you're gone—this disgusts me about myself, but not enough to stop.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I've been saving evidence. Receipt from our first coffee, $8.47, November 3rd, 2:17 PM. You put salt in yours by mistake. Drank it anyway. That's when I knew you were dangerous—someone who commits to their mistakes.\n\nMy phone contains 1,847 photos you don't know exist. Your hands doing ordinary things. The back of your head in bookstores. That specific angle your mouth makes before crying. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits grand theft.\n\n*\n\nBefore we met, I had this recurring dream about drowning. Not in water—in something thicker, warmer. The dream stopped the night you fell asleep on my shoulder on the F train. Later I realized: the dream was prophecy. The drowning was you.\n\n*\n\nListen. I've been dead. Thirteen seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest during a basketball game. No light, no tunnel, just deletion. But here's what haunts me: even in that nothing, there was this... weight. This debt. Three years later you walked into that terrible party wearing rain and looking for someone else. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou want honest? I practice your death nightly. Seventeen different scenarios. Car crashes, rare diseases, sudden disappearance like those people who walk into forests and never return. In the worst version, I speak at your funeral. In the most honest version, I don't survive it. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still making my mortality specific and unbearable.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our ordinary Tuesday. In your war against automated phone systems. In how you save broken cookies for last—some misguided kindness for damaged goods. In your mother's suggestion I'm \"interesting\" (code for disappointment). In future arguments about paint colors where you'll be wrong but I'll surrender because your wrongness is more interesting than anyone else's rightness.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has done: Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound—I've tried recording it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy. I've lost language. Gained something worse and better.\n\nI calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number made me violent. I wanted to sue mathematics. Then you walked in humming off-key and I thought: not enough. Never enough. But this one. This breakfast. This moment where you exist, humming wrong—this is what we have.\n\n*\n\nThe accident: Six months ago. Semi ran the light. You were singing that song you always butcher. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange physics, I'll pay any price. Swerved. Missed by inches. You kept singing. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n*\n\nI'm not a good person. I read your journal once. Just the page where you wrote my name forty-seven times like a spell or a disease. I check your pulse when you sleep. I've already named our hypothetical children—even the ones we'll never have. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom and sob about your temporariness. This isn't romantic. It's pathology.\n\nBut it's also this: choosing you every morning before consciousness fully loads. Finding you in my muscle memory. The way my body turns toward you even in sleep like a broken compass that's accidentally right.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for romance. Not for symbolism. But because my neurons have already rewired around you. Leaving you would require surgical intervention. My sleep cycle synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other.\n\nMarry me because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because last week you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where I've seen you ugly-cry at a documentary about octopi and you've seen me completely undone by your casual kindness.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. Has been for seven months. My grandmother's, who said yes during the Depression because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" She was right. We're all ending. The question is who we're ending with.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I asked. The neurosurgeon said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters. The only word I never mispronounce. Even in my sleep, apparently. You told me. I say it correctly even unconscious.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I'm already married to you in every universe that counts. This is just paperwork for the one where we happened to find each other.\n\nWarren\n(writing this in the kitchen while you sleep, failing to breathe normally, my grandmother's ring burning a hole in my pocket like a small sun)\n\nP.S. — Your left eye waters first. Always. I've carried tissues for three years. You're crying now. I know because I know you like my own reflection, if my reflection was everything worth looking at.\n\nP.P.S. — The pen I'm using? It's running out of ink exactly as I finish this. The universe has a sense of humor. Or timing. Or it's you, somehow, even in this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
