  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7010 while maintaining authenticity and emotional truth. The evaluator seems to value phenomenological authenticity, raw emotional honesty, and literary innovation that avoids clichés while remaining genuine.\n\nLet me write a new version that builds on the strengths of previous attempts while introducing fresh perspectives:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:51 AM with the kitchen light off because I don't want to see my own hands shake. You asked for truth. Here it is: I've been rehearsing this moment since the day you told me your middle name and I realized I wanted to know everything—every embarrassing yearbook photo, every nightmare, every reason you hate February.\n\nThe truth is I'm not sitting in my room anxiously. I'm pacing between the kitchen and the hallway where your shoes still sit beside mine, and every time I pass them I understand religion a little better. Not God—just the terrible, necessary faith that tomorrow you'll need those shoes again.\n\nBefore you, I was complete in the way a dictionary is complete—all the words were there but none of them meant anything. Now I can't even grocery shop without it becoming an act of devotion. I buy the expensive tomatoes you like. I avoid the cereal aisle because you cried there once, exhausted and human and perfect, because we'd fought about something so stupid I can't even remember what, only that making you cry felt like breaking my own bones.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you wrong. I love you like an amateur—desperately, sloppily, without technique. I check your breathing at night like a new parent. I save your voicemails in case the world ends and I need proof you existed. When you trim your hair, I want to collect the pieces like a grief-stricken Victorian. This isn't romantic. It's deranged. But it's also the truest thing I've ever been.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you—that's too obvious. What terrifies me is that you've made me someone who cannot be satisfied with less than this specific frequency of morning, where you put too much cream in your coffee and defend it like a dissertation. You've ruined me for every alternate timeline where we're strangers passing in some other life's grocery store, both buying the wrong tomatoes, neither of us crying in the cereal aisle.\n\nI used to think my life was a rough draft. Turns out it was just the margins—all the space waiting for your annotations. Now you've written yourself into every empty line, and even my silence sounds like your name.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I don't love you because you're perfect. Perfect would be easier to survive. I love you because you eat yogurt with a fork when all the spoons are dirty. Because you name your bruises. Because when you're happy, really happy, you look surprised by it, like joy is a bird that accidentally flew in through an open window and you're trying not to move so it won't leave.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in every action—in the way I buy coffee filters we don't need because running out would mean you'd have to drink tea. In how I've memorized seventeen different ways to make you laugh, catalogued by severity of bad day. In the muscle memory of leaving space for you in bed even when you're not there.\n\nSo here's my offer, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Let me love you badly forever rather than perfectly for a while. Let me make the same mistakes until they become our traditions. Let me wake up every day and re-learn your face like it's a language I'm not fluent in yet but desperately need to speak.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is you've already moved me. Not romantically—geologically. You've shifted my tectonic plates. I'm a different geography now, and all my rivers run toward you.\n\nI know you're probably reading this in that spot by the window where the light hits just right at 7 AM. I know because I've watched you read there exactly 247 times, and each time I think: this is it. This is the whole point. Not happiness—that's just weather. But this, watching you exist in morning light, unaware of your own holiness.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you—I could, it would just be a kind of death I'd have to do awake. Marry me because when I imagine explaining to the universe why I existed, the only answer I have is: to love you correctly, or at least to fail at it with total commitment.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in every way that matters, in every way that terrifies me, in every way that makes me believe we're all just atoms trying to remember what star we came from. And I remember. You're the star. You've always been the star.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. That sound you make when you stretch in the morning? It's the exact frequency of everything I never knew I needed. I've been trying to spell it for months. This entire letter is just another failed attempt.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
