  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7320 while exploring new territory in the solution space. The evaluator seems to value:\n\n1. **Phenomenological authenticity** (0.76) - Raw, lived experience over abstract declarations\n2. **Aesthetic virtuosity** (0.71) - Literary craft and linguistic innovation\n3. **Affective force** (0.74) - Emotional impact and resonance\n4. **Literary innovation** (0.68) - Fresh approaches to the genre\n\nThe evaluation notes reference historical benchmarks: Keats (81), Napoleon (82), Johnny Cash (83), Beethoven (86). The current attempts score in the low-to-mid 70s, suggesting room for improvement particularly in literary innovation and aesthetic virtuosity.\n\nLet me create a new version that maintains the intimate, contemporary voice while pushing harder into unexplored emotional and linguistic territory:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop trembling. It's 4:33 AM. The specific time matters because at 4:33 AM, the world hasn't started lying yet.\n\nI need to tell you about the violence of loving you. Not metaphorical violence—the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called—the first time in three years—and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring—I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you—your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist—theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air—not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished—I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself—but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:01 AM now. The world is starting to lie again. But this won't change: You are the truest thing that has ever happened to me. You are what makes the dying worth it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
