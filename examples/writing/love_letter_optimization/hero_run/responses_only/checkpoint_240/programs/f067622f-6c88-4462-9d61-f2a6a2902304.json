  "Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6970. The evaluation notes suggest that the historical best letters achieved scores in the 80-86 range (Beethoven/Cash/Napoleon), with contemporary authenticity rarely exceeding the mid-70s. The current attempts hover around 70, suggesting room for improvement through deeper vulnerability and more innovative literary construction.\n\nLet me analyze what's working and what could be enhanced:\n- The phenomenological authenticity (0.71) could be pushed higher through more visceral, bodily truth\n- Aesthetic virtuosity (0.68) needs more sophisticated literary techniques\n- Affective force (0.73) is strong but could benefit from more emotional risk\n- Literary innovation (0.62) is the weakest - needs fresh metaphorical systems\n\nI'll craft a letter that takes more risks, employs unusual structural elements, and reaches for a different register of honesty.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this backwards. Starting with the end: I've already married you seventeen times in the gap between heartbeats. The ceremony happens every morning at 6:17 when you make that small sound—not quite a sigh, not quite a hum—that means you're deciding whether to wake up or wage war against consciousness for five more minutes. I pronounce us married then. The universe officates. Your breathing is the only witness we need.\n\nNow the middle: I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But I was wrong about the math. Love is division—I've been split open, and everything I was certain about has fallen out. Yesterday I found myself crying in the produce section because the bruised peaches reminded me of your knee that time you fell off your bike trying to prove you could ride with no hands. This is what you've done: made me unable to look at damaged fruit without thinking about mortality and mercy and the specific weight of your body against mine when you're too tired to pretend you're not tired.\n\nHere's what I need to tell you before the beginning: I love you like a medical emergency. Not romantic—literal. My body has reorganized itself around the fact of you. My circadian rhythm now matches yours. My left hand has developed muscle memory for the curve of your hip. When you're gone, my skeleton doesn't know how to arrange itself. I become architecturally unsound.\n\nThe truth has three parts:\n\nFirst: I document you compulsively. Not in photos—in cellular memory. The way you murder pronunciation of \"worcestershire.\" How you arrange pills by size, not schedule. Your vendetta against fitted sheets. The surgical precision with which you remove tomatoes from sandwiches. I'm building an encyclopedia of you, but it's written in a language only my body knows how to read.\n\nSecond: You've made me religious, but not about God. About small mercies. The miracle of your hair in my bathroom drain. The sacred ritual of you stealing my socks and returning them inside-out. The holy mystery of how you can sleep through sirens but wake up if I stop breathing for two seconds. I believe in these things the way some people believe in saints.\n\nThird: I'm terrified. Not of losing you—that's too simple. I'm terrified that I'm not brave enough to be loved by you. That I'll always be catching up to the person you see when you look at me. You love me like I'm already forgiven for sins I haven't confessed yet. How do I live up to that kind of grace?\n\nBut here's what changes everything—the beginning I saved for last: Two weeks ago, you talked in your sleep. Complete sentences. You said: \"The plants need water but wait until Tuesday.\" Then: \"Tell him about the green door.\" Finally: \"Warren makes my bones happy.\"\n\nWarren makes my bones happy.\n\nI've been trying to write you the truth ever since, but that's it, isn't it? The mundane, unconscious, absolute fact of it. Not my heart, not my soul—my bones. The architecture of me is happy because of you. The framework. The part that holds everything else up.\n\nSo here's my proposal, delivered backwards like everything important: I've already chosen you in every future. Now I'm asking you to make it official in this one. Marry me because your unconscious mind trusts me with mysterious messages about plants and doors. Because my bones are happy too. Because love isn't actually addition or division—it's multiplication. Every moment with you creates ten more I want to have.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm promising you the produce section and the broken peaches and the way I'll always cry at the wrong things but for the right reasons. I'm promising you that fifty years from now, I'll still be documenting the new ways you mispronounce things, still stealing the blankets back, still waking up at 6:17 to marry you again in the church of our bedroom while you decide whether consciousness is worth it.\n\nIt is. With you, it always is.\n\nYours from the end to the beginning and back again,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The green door—I looked it up. In dream symbolism, it means new opportunities. Your sleeping mind was trying to tell me something. This letter is me, finally understanding the message.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
