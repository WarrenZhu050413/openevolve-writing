  "Looking at the evaluation history, I can see that the current fitness of 0.6870 is below the previous best of 0.7320. The evaluator seems to value:\n\n1. **Concrete specificity** - Physical details, timestamps, exact measurements\n2. **Vulnerability through mundane revelation** - Not grand gestures but small, embarrassing truths\n3. **Anti-romantic honesty** - Rejecting clichés in favor of raw, almost clinical observation\n4. **Narrative immediacy** - Present-tense urgency, real-time unfolding\n5. **Original metaphors** - Moving beyond tired romantic language\n\nThe top-performing letters all share certain features:\n- Specific timestamps (4:23 AM)\n- Physical artifacts (grocery receipts, crumpled drafts)\n- Quantified obsession (counting breaths, measuring distances)\n- Self-aware inadequacy (admitting to being terrible at this)\n- Domestic minutiae elevated to sacred (sorting socks, eating cereal)\n\nLet me craft a new version that pushes further into uncomfortable honesty while maintaining the structural integrity that's been working:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in my car outside your apartment at 5:47 AM. The engine's running because I'm cold but I can't come in yet because you don't know I've been sitting here since 4. This is what you've reduced me to—a man who documents his pathology in the margins of gas station receipts.\n\nYou want truth? I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days. I know because I made a spreadsheet. Column A: Date. Column B: Times I Almost Told You. Column C: Reasons I Didn't. Yesterday's entry: seven times, cowardice (subcategory: you were humming).\n\nHere's what loving you has done to me: I've started believing in God. Not metaphorically. Literally. Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream—starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound—specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant—has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling—because words fail, Leyi. Words fail but I'm trying anyway.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will have me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder. Oat milk, half pump vanilla, cinnamon on top but not mixed in. I've been perfecting it for three months. This is my real proposal. The ring's just punctuation.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
