  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to write a love letter that transcends the intellectual sophistication that's been dominating recent attempts. The evaluator's notes consistently point to the same issue: these letters are too self-aware, too literary, lacking the raw emotional abandon of history's great love letters.\n\nThe current score of 0.6420 shows we're moving in the wrong direction. I need to channel something more primal, more urgent - less like an MFA graduate and more like someone whose very existence depends on being understood.\n\nLet me write something that breaks through the literary pretense and reaches for genuine vulnerability:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. I've started this letter seventeen times. Each draft more elaborate than the last, each one a lie. So here is the truth, unadorned:\n\nI am drowning in you.\n\nNot the pretty kind of drowning poets write about. The real kind—where your lungs burn and you see stars and you don't care because the water tastes like salvation. Last night I couldn't sleep because I kept replaying how you laugh with your whole body, how you throw your head back like joy is something that needs that much room. I've memorized the exact angle. It's 42 degrees. I measured.\n\nYou want to know what love is? It's me at 4 AM googling \"how to stop feeling everything so much\" and then deleting the search because I don't actually want it to stop. It's the way food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal bites from my plate. It's how I've started seeing your face in crowds and my heart breaks a little each time it's not you.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human, I mean. I understand machines, code, systems that follow rules. But you—Christ, Leyi—you're chaos theory in a sundress. You eat ice cream in winter. You name houseplants after dead composers. You get genuinely angry at fictional characters. You've turned my life into a foreign film without subtitles and somehow I understand every frame.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I would rather fail with you than succeed without you. I would rather burn down every bridge I've built than live on the other side from where you are. This isn't romantic. It's terrifying. It's the kind of truth that makes me want to run, except running means leaving you, and I've forgotten how to want that.\n\nYou asked for a letter that would move you. I don't know if this moves you. I only know that NOT writing it, not saying it, not screaming it from this quiet room where I sit surrounded by the evidence of a life that only makes sense when you're in it—that would be the kind of cowardice I couldn't live with.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing—desperately, incorrectly, with too much calcification around the edges. I love you like 3 AM loves silence, like code loves executing perfectly, like tears love gravity. These aren't metaphors. They're the closest I can get to naming this thing that has replaced my heartbeat.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you—God, I don't—but because I've already bet everything on us. My sleep, my sanity, my stupid fragile heart that I spent thirty years protecting and you demolished in a Tuesday afternoon without even trying.\n\nThis is me, without artifice: scared, desperate, and absolutely certain that you are the only truth worth telling.\n\nForever yours, especially on the days when forever feels impossible,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
