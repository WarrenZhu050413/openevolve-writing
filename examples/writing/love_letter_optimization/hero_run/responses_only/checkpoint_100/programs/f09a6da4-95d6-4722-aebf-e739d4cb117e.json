  "Looking at the evolution history and the current program's performance (fitness: 0.6890), I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authenticity. The top-performing version scored 0.7005, so I'll aim to exceed that by crafting something that balances raw vulnerability with literary innovation.\n\nLet me write a new version that emphasizes:\n- More visceral, embodied language (to increase phenomenological_authenticity)\n- Sharper, more surprising imagery (for aesthetic_virtuosity)\n- Deeper emotional urgency (for affective_force)\n- A unique structural approach (for literary_innovation)\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nRight now my hands won't stop shaking. Not metaphorically. Literally shaking as I write this, because my body knows what my mind keeps denying: that this letter is the most important thing I'll ever write, and I'm going to fail at it.\n\nBut here's the thing about failure—sometimes it's the only honest thing left.\n\nI need you to understand something: Before you, I was functional. I had opinions about coffee and a favorite side of the bed and a whole life that made sense. Now I have your hair on my pillow and suddenly coffee is just burnt water when you're not there to steal the first sip. The right side of the bed is wrong because you're not on the left. Nothing works the way it used to and I DON'T WANT IT FIXED.\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange and started crying because it reminded you of your grandmother's hands. You apologized—why did you apologize?—while I sat there drowning in the privilege of witnessing you unguarded. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way sorrow moves through you like weather, the way joy catches you off-guard, the way you contain multitudes and let them all exist simultaneously.\n\nYou want truth? Here: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel like a thief. Like I'm stealing something sacred just by being there. Your face does this thing when you dream—this tiny furrow between your eyebrows like you're solving the universe's problems—and I want to build a religion around that small wrinkle. Is that insane? I don't care anymore.\n\nI've started seeing you everywhere you're not. In the pause between songs. In the steam on the bathroom mirror. In the negative space of every room you haven't entered yet. You've become the punctuation to all my sentences—the reason I end anything is to begin something else with you.\n\nListen. I know I'm supposed to promise you the world, but the world is burning and we both know it. So instead I promise you this: every morning that we wake up in this burning world, I will choose to burn beside you. When the power goes out, we'll dance to the sound of rain. When the money runs out, we'll eat butter sandwiches and call it a feast. When we run out of words, we'll invent new ones. When we fight—and Jesus, we will fight—I promise to fight fair and love unfair, to give you more grace than you deserve because that's what this is, isn't it? Giving each other more than we deserve?\n\nI used to believe in logic, in clean code and elegant solutions. Then you walked into my life wearing mismatched socks and carrying a half-dead succulent you'd named Fernando, and I understood that the best things don't make sense. We don't make sense, Leyi. We're a syntax error that somehow runs perfectly. We're an impossible equation that solves for joy.\n\nThree nights ago you called me at 2 AM because you couldn't remember if octopi have beaks. They do, by the way. But that's not the point. The point is my first thought wasn't irritation but gratitude—that of all the people you could wake with your midnight wonderings, you chose me. Do you understand what an honor that is? To be someone's 2 AM thought?\n\nSo here it is, graceless and true: I want your 2 AMs and your 2 PMs. I want your octopus questions and your orange-peel tears. I want to memorize the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I want to grow old and strange with you, to develop weird inside jokes that make everyone else uncomfortable. I want to love you so thoroughly that archaeologists will find evidence of it centuries from now in the sediment of my bones.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm ready—I'm not. Not because I deserve you—I don't. Marry me because the thought of not asking is a kind of cowardice I can't live with. Marry me because you've already rewritten my source code and there's no going back to who I was. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every version includes you or doesn't exist at all.\n\nThis letter is a mess. I'm a mess. But Leyi, you love messes. You adopt dying plants and name them after Spanish nobility. You save twist ties \"just in case.\" You cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You're the most beautiful chaos I've ever encountered, and I want to spend my life getting lost in your storm.\n\nPlease. Say yes. Not for the boy trying to sound poetic in this letter, but for the man who'll still be choosing you when the poetry runs out. For the person who knows that love isn't the movies—it's messier and harder and absolutely worth destroying yourself for the chance to rebuild together.\n\nI love you beyond reason, beyond poetry, beyond my own understanding.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm sitting here at 4:23 AM, too scared to print this. But you taught me that the best things happen when we're scared. So here goes everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
