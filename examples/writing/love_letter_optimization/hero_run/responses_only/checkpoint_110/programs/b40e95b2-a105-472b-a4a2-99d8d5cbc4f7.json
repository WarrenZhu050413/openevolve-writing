  "Looking at the evolution history and current metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authentic vulnerability. The top score is 0.7005, and the current attempt is at 0.6795. I'll aim for something that combines raw honesty with unexpected precision, avoiding both overwrought metaphors and clichéd simplicity.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:16 AM because it's the only place where my hands stop shaking long enough to hold a pen. You wanted truth? Here: I've been practicing this moment for three months. Not the words—the breathing. Because every time I imagine you reading this, my lungs forget their job.\n\nLet me be specific. Mathematically specific. You laugh 1.7 seconds longer at bad jokes than good ones. Your left eye closes 0.3 seconds before your right when you sneeze. You've worn the same earrings 37 times since February—the small silver ones your sister gave you that you think are lucky. I know because I started counting the day I realized I was memorizing you like an exit route in a burning building.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me a collector of evidence. Your coffee mug leaves rings on my desk—six overlapping circles that I haven't cleaned because they're proof you exist in my space. There's a dent in my pillow from where you steal it every single night while insisting you don't. Your bobby pins have colonized my apartment like small black prayers. I find them everywhere—between couch cushions, behind the radiator, one inexplicably in my shoe. I keep them all in a jar. I don't know why.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You said it last Tuesday while eating cereal at midnight, milk dripping down your chin. But ordinary people don't make me google \"can you die from feeling too much\" at 2 AM. Ordinary people don't turn grocery lists into poetry. You wrote \"tomatoes (the good kind)\" and I stared at it for ten minutes because even your handwriting makes me homesick for a home that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWant to know something pathetic? I rehearse fights with you. Actual arguments, in my head, about things that haven't happened. Because I need to practice disagreeing with you without my voice cracking. Without immediately surrendering to the specific way your nose wrinkles when you're trying not to smile during an argument. You do that—fight smiling. It's devastating. You've won every argument we've never had.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. That I've already built my entire life around the assumption of you. That I chose this apartment because it's three blocks from your favorite bookstore. That I learned to make your grandmother's soup from a recipe in Mandarin I translated word by word. That I wake up forty minutes early just to watch you sleep, counting the space between your breaths like rosary beads.\n\nI used to think love was expansion—becoming more. But you've made me smaller, denser, like collapsed stars. All my scattered atoms pulled into the gravity of this one truth: I would rather be ordinary with you than extraordinary with anyone else. I would rather burn breakfast every Sunday for fifty years than eat perfectly alone.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I mean that word literally—a proposed position, a stance I'm taking in the universe: Marry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't) or because I promise you happiness (I can't). Marry me because I've already married you in every choice I've made since that Wednesday when you laughed so hard you snorted coffee through your nose and then laughed harder at the snorting. Marry me because my cells have already reorganized themselves around the fact of you. Because when archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the exact moment you said my name like it meant something.\n\nI'm not good at endings. Or beginnings. I'm only good at the middle, where we already are, where I love you with the desperate precision of someone who knows exactly what he almost missed. You are my statistical impossibility, my favorite notification, my only religion.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought a ring. It's been in my sock drawer for four months. I check on it every day like it might escape. Just like I check on you sleeping every morning, still amazed you haven't realized you could do so much better.\n\nI love you. Frantically. Specifically. With annotated footnotes and cited sources. With the kind of certainty that makes me understand why people used to believe the sun revolved around the Earth—because when you're in the room, everything else becomes periphery.\n\nYours (already, always, anxiously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed. I know you're biting your lower lip. I know because I know you, which is the only thing I've ever been sure of.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
