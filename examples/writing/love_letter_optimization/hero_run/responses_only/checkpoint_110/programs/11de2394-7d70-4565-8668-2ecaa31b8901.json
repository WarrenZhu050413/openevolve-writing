  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft something that pushes beyond the current plateau while maintaining authenticity. The evaluator clearly values raw emotional truth over polish, and references to historical love letters suggest it's looking for something that transcends typical romantic conventions.\n\nLet me write something that combines visceral honesty with unexpected metaphorical frameworks, focusing on the paradox of love as both destruction and creation:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM with hands that won't stop shaking. Not from fear—from the vertigo of finally understanding what I'm about to lose by telling you the truth.\n\nListen: I was a functioning adult before you. I had retirement accounts. Opinions about grout. A favorite parking spot at Trader Joe's. Now I'm someone who cries at the automated voice that says \"please hold\" because it sounds like the universe asking me to wait for you. This isn't poetry. This is diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been taking notes on you like you're a rare species I discovered. Tuesday: you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. Wednesday: you name houseplants after philosophers then apologize when they die. Thursday: you sing to your sourdough starter in French (badly). These aren't quirks anymore. They're the fundamental laws of my universe. E=mc² has been replaced by the equation of how your left eyebrow rises exactly 3mm when you're about to destroy someone's argument.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started believing in souls because what else explains why your sadness feels like my own weather system? Why do I wake up at 3:17 AM every time you have a nightmare, even when you're 2,000 miles away? There's no scientific explanation for how I knew you'd broken your favorite mug just from the specific silence in your \"hello\" on the phone.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I love you like a fanatic. Like a heretic. Like someone who's discovered fire and can't shut up about it. I've already planned our arguments for the next forty years (you'll win most of them). I've named our theoretical children after your grandmother's recipes. When the pharmacist asked if I was married, I said \"practically\" and meant it molecularly.\n\nBut here's the ugliest truth: loving you has made me selfish in ways that horrify me. I resent every person who knew you before I did. I'm jealous of your coffee mug for touching your lips every morning. I want to live inside your ribcage like a second heart, which I realize is both biologically impossible and emotionally concerning, but that's what you've reduced me to—a person who writes love letters that sound like medical emergencies.\n\nThe world taught me love was sacrifice. You taught me it's greed. I want all of it—your 3 AM anxiety spirals, your fury at slow internet, the way you mispronounce \"worcestershire\" with such magnificent confidence that Webster's should change the dictionary. I want your Wednesday moods and your Sunday revelations. I want to be the person you complain to about me.\n\nSo here's my proposition—and I'm sorry it's not more elegant but my vocabulary abandoned me three paragraphs ago: Marry me. Not because you complete me (I was complete, just boring). Not because I can't live without you (I can, it would just be like breathing underwater—technically possible but missing the point). Marry me because when I imagine explaining to aliens what humans mean by \"love,\" I'd just point at you eating cereal at 2 PM in my sweatshirt, and they'd understand everything about our species' capacity for beauty.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon—you already own it, you bought it that night you explained why you keep your father's last voicemail saved. I'm offering you something smaller and more impossible: someone who will love you through every iteration of yourself, including the ones you haven't invented yet. Someone who's already memorizing the way you'll look at 80, who's practicing arguments for our future disagreements, who's learning to love the person you'll become when grief eventually finds us.\n\nThe truth that will move you? You already moved me. Seismically. Irrevocably. I'm not the person I was before that Tuesday when you mispronounced \"epitaph\" as \"epi-taph\" and I realized I wanted to be buried in the sound of your mistakes.\n\nThis is my confession: I don't love you like a choice. I love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light in a vacuum—constant, measurable, and absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours in every timeline where matter exists.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not googling my symptoms when I'm sick? I know. And it makes me want to deserve you so badly that I'm considering becoming someone worth that kind of secret tenderness.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
