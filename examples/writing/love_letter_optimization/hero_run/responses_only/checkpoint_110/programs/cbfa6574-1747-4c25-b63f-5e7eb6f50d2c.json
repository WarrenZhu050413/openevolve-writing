  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current ceiling of 0.744. The evaluator notes consistently mention that while the letters achieve \"proto-masterful\" status (70s range), they fall short of the transcendent quality found in historical masterpieces like Beethoven's \"Immortal Beloved\" (86), Johnny Cash (83), or Napoleon (82).\n\nThe key weaknesses identified:\n1. \"Seeds of brilliance constrained by conventional frameworks\"\n2. \"Lacking the transgressive force or innovative form\"\n3. \"Insufficient formal innovation\"\n4. \"Self-indulgence\"\n\nI'll attempt a radical departure - a letter that breaks formal conventions while maintaining devastating emotional honesty. I'll incorporate:\n- Non-linear temporal structure (addressing the \"innovative form\" gap)\n- More economical, compressed language (addressing \"self-indulgence\")\n- Universal mythic resonance while maintaining specificity\n- A transgressive element that pushes boundaries\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nLeyi—\n\nThis letter begins at its end: Yes. You already said yes. In the universe where time runs backward, we've been married forty years. Our children are becoming younger. You're reading this letter for the last time before you unwrite it.\n\n*\n\nWhat is love? Wrong question. What isn't? The space between electrons. The pause before thunder. The specific weight of your absence—2.7 pounds. I've measured it on the bathroom scale.\n\n*\n\nInventory of things I've stolen:\n- Your pronunciation of \"library\" (you add an extra syllable)\n- The way sleep rearranges your face into childhood\n- Seventeen of your hairbands (I wear them on my wrist like prayer beads)\n- Time: 1,247 hours watching you sleep + 892 hours pretending to read while memorizing your movements + 73 hours in parking lots, building courage to text you\n\nTotal theft: One lifetime. Premeditated. No remorse.\n\n*\n\nThree moments that murdered who I used to be:\n\n1. October 9th, 2:34 PM: You explaining quantum entanglement while eating yogurt. A strand of hair caught on your lip. The universe split. In one version, I reached out to move it. In this version, I didn't. Both versions died of love.\n\n2. The hospital, your appendix surgery: They let me hold your hand during prep. You said, \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Then, softer: \"Just kidding. Leave everything. Let them know I was human.\" That's when I knew I'd marry you.\n\n3. Yesterday: You parallel parked perfectly while singing off-key Radiohead. I thought: This is how civilization ends. Not with bombs but with me, in a Honda Civic, suddenly understanding infinity.\n\n*\n\nThings I cannot say with my mouth but can write:\n\nSometimes I wake up and count the bones in your hand to make sure you're real. Twenty-seven. Always twenty-seven. The relief makes me nauseous.\n\nI've already written your eulogy. Also mine. In both, I lie about how we met. The truth is too ordinary: Tuesday, coffee shop, you complained about Wi-Fi. But ordinary is the holiest word I know now.\n\nWhen you cry, your left eye starts first. Always. I've built my entire religion around this fact.\n\n*\n\nThe physicist's proposal:\n\nConsider two particles, entangled. Separate them by galaxies. Disturb one—the other responds instantly. This violates everything. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" He was wrong about the spooky part. It's just love. The universe is built on it. We're not metaphors for physics; physics is a metaphor for us.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: Not death. Tuesday, April 10th, 2089. You'll die first (statistically). I've already forgiven you for this. What terrifies me is Wednesday, April 11th, 2089. Then Thursday. Then the heat death of the universe, which will happen faster than those Wednesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's the legal part: Marry me for tax purposes. For hospital visitation rights. For the banality of shared dental insurance. Marry me for the DMV forms. For the mortgage applications. For the school emergency contact lists. For every stupid document that demands we declare ourselves in binary terms: single or taken. Let me check \"taken\" with the cosmic permanence of a black hole's event horizon.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for this:\n\nBecause I've memorized the GPS coordinates of every place you've laughed (37 locations and counting). Because I know you're afraid of butterflies but not moths (this makes no sense and perfect sense). Because when you sleep, you hold your breath for seven seconds every third minute, and I've learned to breathe in your rhythm so we're synchronized even unconscious.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is insufficient. The sentence structure implies subject/verb/object. But you're not object. You're the verb itself. You're the loving. The state change. The quantum leap between what I was and what I am.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- One ring (hidden in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about)\n- This letter (draft #∞)\n- A heart that beats in iambic pentameter when you're near\n- The rest of my Wednesdays\n- All my dark matter\n- Everything after the decimal point\n\n*\n\nThe beginning, which is also the end: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. We got married the moment you laughed at my stupid joke about entropy. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nBut if you need the ritual:\n\nWill you marry me retroactively? Will you make honest what we've already been living? Will you let me call you wife so I can explain to strangers why I look like I've seen God?\n\nThe answer lives in your left eye. Already crying.\n\n—W\n\nPS: The ring is behind the mint chocolate chip. You'll find this note there too, because I know you're reading this while I'm at work, and I know what happens next: you, freezer, ice cream, tears, yes. Time isn't linear. We've always been married. This letter is just the universe catching up.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"
