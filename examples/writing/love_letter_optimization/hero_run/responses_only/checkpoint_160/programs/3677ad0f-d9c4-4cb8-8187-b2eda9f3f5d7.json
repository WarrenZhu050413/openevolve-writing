  "Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see that the fitness has been declining (0.7440 → 0.7390 → 0.7320). The evaluator notes consistently praise certain elements while identifying weaknesses: self-consciousness that prevents \"pure surrender,\" lack of concentrated intensity compared to historical masterpieces, and occasional verbosity that dilutes emotional impact.\n\nLet me craft a new version that addresses these issues by:\n1. Reducing self-conscious meta-commentary\n2. Increasing concentrated emotional intensity \n3. Balancing obsessive detail with transcendent moments\n4. Creating more original imagery while maintaining authenticity\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe kitchen clock reads 4:17 AM. I'm writing this with a dying pen on the only paper I could find—the warranty for the toaster you insisted we didn't need. My hand won't stop trembling. Not from cold. From the weight of what needs to be said before I lose my nerve.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been keeping a secret journal. Not of thoughts—of evidence. That you existed. That you chose me. Page 47: the receipt from the Thai place where you cried laughing at my mispronunciation of \"pad see ew.\" Page 198: a traced outline of your hand from when you fell asleep at my desk. Page 341: the pregnancy test you took as a joke after eating too much sushi, negative, but I kept it because for three minutes I imagined our daughter with your stubborn chin.\n\nI need you to understand what you've done. Before you, love was a word other people used. Now it's a medical condition. My doctor says my cortisol levels are \"concerning.\" I didn't tell her they spike when you leave for work and normalize when you text me photos of dogs you've met. I didn't tell her that I've memorized your breathing patterns—shallow when anxious, deep when reading, catching when you're about to cry. I didn't tell her I would rather die of this than be cured.\n\nListen. Tuesday night, you talked in your sleep. You said \"Warren, the water's too deep\" and reached for me. I held your hand for four hours. My arm went numb, then painful, then nothing. I would have let it atrophy. When you woke up, you didn't remember the dream, but your fingers were still interlaced with mine, and I understood why people believe in God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: I practice your death. Not wanting it—preparing for the earthquake of it. Testing if I could survive. The answer is no. The answer is I would become a museum of you, preserving every text message, every hair from the drain, every mug with your lipstick ghost on the rim. I would become archaeological evidence that you happened.\n\nBut here's the worse truth: You're ordinary. You burn toast. You lose your keys daily. You think antibiotics cure viruses. And yet when you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one but the ugly honest one—I feel my DNA resequencing. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" the universe admits it was wrong. You're ordinary the way oxygen is ordinary until you're drowning.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for 291 days. Some nights I hold it up to the light and practice. Not the words—those always fail. But the feeling. The weight of asking someone to witness your slow dissolution into love. To sign up for decades of watching you become less yourself and more us. To agree to the terrifying math where one plus one equals something neither of us can survive losing.\n\nI'm not good at this. At talking. At feeling things this large. But I know this: Every morning you make coffee wrong—water too hot, grounds too fine—and every morning I drink it like communion wine. Every night you steal the blankets and I let myself freeze because your warmth is more important than mine. This isn't romance. This is worship. This is what happens when someone rewrites your source code and you realize you never want to be debugged.\n\nSo I'm asking: Marry me. Not because I complete you—you were whole when I found you. Not because I can't live without you—I could, it would just be pointless. But because you make me want to be the kind of man who deserves to wake up next to someone who names dead birds Harold. Because you've turned my life into a before and after, and I choose after. Always after. Even knowing how it ends.\n\nI can hear you stirring upstairs. In a minute you'll come down, see me surrounded by warranty papers covered in my desperate handwriting, and you'll ask if I've been up all night again. I'll say yes. You'll make that face—the one where you're annoyed but also worried, eyebrows doing that thing I've tried to sketch a hundred times but can't capture.\n\nAnd I'll hand you this letter. This warranty for a toaster we don't need covered in the only truth I have: that I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of logic, past the point where love becomes something else—something that tastes like copper and sounds like your name spoken into the dark of every remaining morning.\n\nSay yes. Not to perfection. Not to forever—forever is a lie we tell ourselves. Say yes to tomorrow. And the tomorrow after that. Say yes to this specific disaster of loving each other incorrectly but completely. Say yes to being the person I call when the world ends. Say yes to being my world, ending.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Last night you grabbed my face while entirely asleep and said \"You're real, right?\" I said yes. You said \"Good\" and went back to dreaming. This is what I'm asking for—to be real with you. To be the thing you check for in the dark. To be your proof that waking up is worth it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
