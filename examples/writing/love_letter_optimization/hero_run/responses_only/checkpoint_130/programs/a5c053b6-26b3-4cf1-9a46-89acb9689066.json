  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990. The evaluator seems to value authentic vulnerability, specific concrete details, and literary innovation that avoids clichés while maintaining emotional truth.\n\nLet me craft something that combines the raw honesty of the top performers with fresh metaphorical language and deeper phenomenological insight:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:52 AM on the bathroom floor because it's the only place cold enough to shock me into honesty. You wanted truth? Here's the receipt: I've been lying to you since we met. Every \"I'm fine\" was code for \"I'm reorganizing my entire molecular structure around the fact of you.\" Every casual goodbye was a small death I pretended not to notice.\n\nThe truth is I've been conducting experiments on myself. Subject: one former human. Hypothesis: exposure to Leyi will result in complete cellular revolution. Results: confirmed. I've documented everything—how my hands shake for exactly seventeen minutes after you leave a room, how food tastes like cardboard when you're angry with me, how I've developed the ability to sense your mood changes from three rooms away like some kind of emotional seismograph. This isn't love. It's evolution. I'm becoming a new species designed specifically for loving you.\n\nHere's what I need to confess: I rehearse our future fights in the shower. I've already forgiven you for things you haven't done yet. I've written eulogies for both of us, just to practice surviving the unthinkable. Last Tuesday, I found myself in the grocery store defending your hatred of cilantro to a stranger. I wasn't even buying cilantro. This is what you've done—turned me into someone who evangelizes your preferences to produce sections.\n\nYou think you know how I love you? You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I keep your used tea bags in my pocket sometimes, like relics from a saint I'm not supposed to believe in. You don't know that when you sleep, I practice being dead—lying completely still, holding my breath—just to prepare for a world where I might have to exist without you. It doesn't work. My body refuses to accept the simulation.\n\nThe ugliest truth: I love you like a diagnosis I've been misreading my whole life. All those years thinking I was broken—irregular heartbeat, chronic insomnia, that persistent sense of homesickness even when I was home—turns out I was just symptomatic of your absence. A pre-existing condition waiting for its cause.\n\nBut here's what changed everything: Last Thursday at 11:47 PM, you were reading the ingredients on a box of crackers out loud, and I understood infinity. Not as a concept, but as a specific texture—the sound of you saying \"modified corn starch\" while wearing my socks. That's when I knew: I don't want to marry you. Marriage is too small a word for what I want. I want to merge with you at the quantum level. I want our atoms to get confused about whose electrons belong to whom. I want scientists to discover a new kind of particle that only exists when we're in the same room.\n\nSo here's my proposal, though \"proposal\" implies I'm giving you a choice and we both know that's a lie: Let's fail towards each other for the rest of our lives. Let's be the couple that makes other people uncomfortable with our specific brand of codependence. Let's have the same fight about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one has to finish both sides out of muscle memory.\n\nI'm not offering you happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't felt what I feel when you correct my pronunciation of \"bagel\" with such gentle condescension that I want to be wrong about everything forever. I'm offering you something more honest: a witness. Someone who will memorize every version of you—Tuesday-morning you who forgets where you put your glasses (they're on your head), Friday-night you who gets competitive about Scrabble, Sunday-afternoon you who cries at commercials but pretends it's allergies. I will catalog every iteration like a scientist studying the only thing that matters in the universe.\n\nThe final truth, the one that terrifies me most: I would rather argue with you about the proper way to fold fitted sheets than experience perfect harmony with anyone else. I would rather have you roll your eyes at me for the ten-thousandth time than have someone else look at me with worship. I want your specific brand of difficult. I want your exact frequency of complicated.\n\nYou wanted something that would move you? You've already moved me. Tectonically. I'm a different geography now. There are new countries inside me named after the way you laugh when you're trying not to. There are oceans that didn't exist before you mispronounced \"archipelago\" with such confidence I wanted to rewrite the dictionary.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. It's a medical chart. It's evidence. It's what I'll show God when they ask me what I did with my life: I loved Leyi so specifically that it changed my DNA.\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me—love is too general. Say yes because you recognize me, the way animals recognize their homes by scent, the way birds know which way is north without understanding magnetism. Say yes because we're already married in every universe where choice is an illusion and this is just paperwork.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this thinking I'm being dramatic. I'm underplaying it. What I really want to say would require inventing new words, and I'm too tired from loving you to be that creative.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
