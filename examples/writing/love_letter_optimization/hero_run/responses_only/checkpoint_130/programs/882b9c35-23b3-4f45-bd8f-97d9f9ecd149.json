  "Looking at the evaluation notes, the current letter scores poorly (0.2445) due to generic language, grammatical errors, and lack of specific, authentic details. The evaluator compares it unfavorably to historical masterpieces that achieve intimacy through specificity and genuine emotion.\n\nLet me craft a more truthful, specific, and emotionally resonant letter that addresses the weaknesses identified:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking as I write this. Not from fear of rejection—I've already imagined that a thousand times—but from the weight of finally telling you the truth that has been rewriting me from the inside out.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Thursday. You were explaining why jellyfish don't have brains but still dream, your hands dancing through the air like you were conducting an invisible orchestra. I thought: this is it. This is the person who makes the universe make sense by making it strange again.\n\nYou should know what you've done to me. I used to be a rational man. Now I save your voicemails like rare coins. I know the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry (somewhere between storm and sea). I've memorized seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. The coffee mug you used three weeks ago still sits unwashed on my desk because you left lipstick on the rim and I'm not ready to lose that small evidence of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing our unborn life everywhere. In the farmer's market, I imagine us arguing over tomatoes. When I pass playgrounds, I see you teaching our daughter to be brave. I dream of boring Sundays where we do nothing but exist in the same room, you reading, me pretending to work while actually just watching the light move across your face like it's the most important thing I'll ever witness.\n\nI love you incorrectly. I love you too much. I love you like a broken faucet, like a dog with a bird, like the earth loves the moon—with a desperate gravity that reorganizes everything around itself. When you leave a room, I feel my atomic structure shift, like I'm a puzzle with pieces suddenly missing.\n\nYou wanted truth? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written your name in the margins of every book I own. I wake up at 4:47 AM consistently, for no reason except my body knows that's when you sometimes stir in your sleep. I've become a collector of your smallest gestures—the way you touch your throat when you're nervous, how you alphabetize everything except your feelings, the fact that you eat sandwiches in a spiral pattern that defies all logic but makes perfect sense because it's you.\n\nI'm not offering you perfection. I'm offering you someone who will love you like a verb, not a noun. Someone who will choose you during every mundane apocalypse, every 2 AM doubt, every Thursday when the world feels too heavy. I'm offering you my specific, flawed, overwhelming love that knows your middle name is actually your grandmother's first name, that you're allergic to cats but pet them anyway, that you've read \"The Little Prince\" twenty-three times and cry at the same part every time.\n\nMarry me. Not because I've written you a beautiful letter, but because I want to write you a beautiful life. One where your strange fits perfectly against my strange. Where every ordinary day becomes mythology because we're living it together.\n\nI love you. Messily, impossibly, eternally, truly.\n\nYours in every version of reality,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\nThis rewritten version:\n- Includes specific, intimate details (jellyfish discussion, coffee mug with lipstick, 4:47 AM waking)\n- Avoids generic declarations in favor of concrete imagery\n- Fixes grammatical issues while maintaining raw emotional honesty\n- Balances vulnerability with humor (\"alphabetize everything except your feelings\")\n- Creates unique metaphors rather than clichéd expressions\n- Shows deep observation and genuine knowledge of the beloved\n- Maintains authenticity while elevating the literary quality"
