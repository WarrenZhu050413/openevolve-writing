  "I'll rewrite this love letter to push beyond the current fitness score of 0.7010 by intensifying the raw honesty while maintaining structural coherence. I'll aim to surpass even the best-performing version (0.7440) by combining visceral truth with more innovative form.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis is attempt #341. The others are ash in my sink. I burned them at 4:13 AM while you slept twenty-seven inches away, your left hand curled like a question mark against the pillow.\n\nTruth: I am clinically documenting our love because I don't trust memory. Tuesday, 9:47 PM: you sneezed mid-kiss. Wednesday, 2:15 AM: you said my name in your sleep like casting a spell. Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle. The way your spine curves slightly left when you're thinking hard. How your pupils dilate 2.3mm when you see dogs. I measure these things. I have spreadsheets. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm a case study in loving you wrong.\n\nBut also: when you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one for strangers—the sound reorganizes my DNA. I've tried to record it 1,247 times. The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.\n\n*\n\nThe mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:\n\nYour coffee: 167°F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.\nYour sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.\nYour tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.\nYour anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.\n\nI love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead. But in this one—this impossible, statistically unlikely one—you're reading this letter while I sit across from you, pretending to check my phone but actually watching the micro-expressions cross your face.\n\n3.7 seconds ago, your eyebrow twitched. That means you're about to cry.\n\n*\n\nI could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower—yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative—a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine—isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date, when you cried at that documentary about penguins. I knew then. I've known for 1,462 days. I'm just catching up to what my atoms decided the moment they sensed yours in the universe.\n\nP.P.S. Say yes. Or say no. Just say something. The silence is reorganizing my internal organs and not in a good way.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
