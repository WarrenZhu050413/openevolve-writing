  "Looking at the evaluation notes, the current letter is criticized for being generic, having grammatical errors, and lacking the depth and specificity of great love letters from history. Let me craft something more authentic, specific, and emotionally resonant while fixing the grammatical issues.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI sit here in my room, hands trembling—not from fear, but from the weight of truth I must finally speak. You asked for honesty that moves you, and I realize now that all my rehearsed words crumble before the simple fact of you.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound rewired something fundamental in me. I've been trying to map it ever since—this transformation you've wrought—but it defies all my frameworks. You've made me gloriously lost in my own life.\n\nI used to believe love was comprehensible, reducible to neurochemistry and evolutionary imperatives. But loving you has taught me the poverty of that understanding. When you tilt your head while thinking, when you absently hum that melody you claim not to know, when your eyes narrow at injustice—these moments accumulate into something I can only call sacred. Not in any religious sense, but in the way that certain experiences demand reverence beyond explanation.\n\nI am not a poet. I write code, I build systems, I solve problems. But you've become the beautiful problem I never want to solve—the recursive function that deepens with each iteration, the algorithm whose elegance only reveals more mysteries. You've made me inarticulate in the best possible way.\n\nHere's what I know: Without you, I am functional but not alive. With you, I am terrified and certain, vulnerable and invincible. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who completes you—it's about finding someone who makes you want to complete yourself, then exceeding that, together.\n\nI offer you no promises of perfection. I will forget anniversaries, burn dinners, and occasionally retreat into my own mind when I should be present. But I will also wake every morning astonished by the privilege of your proximity. I will learn your languages—spoken and unspoken. I will protect your solitude as fiercely as I seek your company.\n\nMarry me, not because I'm worthy—I'm not—but because the universe made an error in my favor when it brought us together, and I want to spend my life earning that cosmic miscalculation.\n\nYours in terrified hope,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"
