  "I'll rewrite the love letter program to create something even more truthful, raw, and emotionally resonant - pushing deeper into vulnerability while maintaining literary sophistication.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with the door locked because if you walk in and see me crying over my own words, I'll lose the courage to finish. This is attempt number seven. The others are crumpled in the trash, each one failing to explain how you've become the punctuation to all my sentences, the reason I check if I'm dreaming by counting my fingers—five, still five, you're still real.\n\nListen. Before you, I understood love academically. I could define it: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin. Neural pathways. Evolution's trick. But then you laughed at my terrible joke about orthogonal matrices that Tuesday in the rain, actually laughed—not politely but helplessly—and every textbook definition evaporated. Now love means the specific weight of your head on my chest at 2:17 AM. It means knowing you eat cereal dry when you're nervous. It means I've memorized the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry during commercials about dogs.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've become a collector of your abandonments. That hair tie you left on my nightstand three months ago. The coffee mug with your lipstick ghost on the rim. The indent in my pillow from where you sleep—always on my side, never yours. I'm building a museum of evidence that you existed in my space, because some primitive part of my brain is terrified that without proof, I might have imagined you entirely.\n\nYou should know that I've already married you in a thousand small ways. When the barista asks for a name, I give yours. When I'm sick, I imagine your hand on my forehead and my fever breaks. I buy strawberries I don't eat because you might come over. I've been living in the conditional tense—if Leyi were here, when Leyi gets back, for when Leyi needs me—and I'm exhausted from conjugating my entire existence around your hypothetical presence.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes loving you feels like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water. Like evolution is happening in real-time, rewriting my DNA to need you for basic survival. I used to be proud of my independence. Now I'm just grateful for my dependence on you. Is that weakness? Maybe. But I'd rather be weak with you than strong without you.\n\nRemember when you asked why I was staring at you that morning with the terrible hangover? You had makeup smeared under your eyes, hair like a bird's nest, and you were wearing my college sweatshirt inside-out. You looked absolutely wrecked. And all I could think was: this. This is the face I want to see when I'm dying. This is the last image I want my brain to process before the lights go out. Because if heaven exists, it looks exactly like you at your most human.\n\nI need to tell you about the fear. The specific gravity of it. Sometimes I wake up at 4 AM convinced you're going to realize you could do better. That you'll discover I'm just a collection of anxieties in a trenchcoat pretending to be a functional adult. That you'll see how I practice my casual \"good morning\" twelve times before you wake up, how I screenshot every heart emoji you send, how I've written your name ten thousand times in notebook margins like a teenager. The fear that you'll realize I love you more than you love me, and that imbalance will make you pity me.\n\nBut here's the thing—I'd rather live with that fear than live without you. I'd rather spend every day terrified of losing you than spend one day secure in someone else's arms. Because you've ruined me for anyone else. You've made every other person seem like they're speaking a language I no longer understand.\n\nSo yes, Leyi. I'm proposing. Not marriage—that's just paperwork. I'm proposing that we stop pretending this is casual. That we admit we've already crawled inside each other's lives so deeply that separation would require surgery. I'm proposing that when you wake up tomorrow, you wake up as someone who has been claimed, publicly and permanently. That we stop testing the water and just jump, even though neither of us can swim, even though the bottom is invisible, even though we might drown.\n\nBut if we drown, we drown together. And honestly? There's no other way I'd rather go under.\n\nSay yes. Say yes because you already know all my passwords. Say yes because you can't sleep without the sound of my breathing. Say yes because we've already built a language of looks across crowded rooms. Say yes because the alternative—a life where we're just friends, where I have to watch you love someone else, where I pretend your happiness with another person is enough—would be a kind of death I'm not brave enough to survive.\n\nI love you. Messily. Desperately. Permanently. Without dignity or reason or any sense of self-preservation.\n\nPlease. Marry me.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. I know because I know you. And knowing you—every tell, every habit, every beautiful, maddening contradiction—has been the greatest privilege of my small, lucky life.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
