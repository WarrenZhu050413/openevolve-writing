  "Looking at this love letter optimization task, I need to write a deeply authentic and moving love letter that improves upon the current fitness score of 0.6295. The evaluation notes from previous attempts suggest that the most successful letters achieve:\n\n1. **Raw emotional honesty** without intellectual distance\n2. **Specific, vivid details** that feel lived rather than literary\n3. **Simplicity and directness** over ornate language\n4. **Genuine vulnerability** that risks everything\n\nThe current letter is too long and perhaps too polished. Let me create something more raw, more desperate, more true - inspired by the directness of Johnny Cash and the urgency of Keats.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm bad at this. My hands are shaking. You said you wanted truth, so here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I save memes I'll never send because what if you don't laugh? When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me—turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way—literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything—I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you—I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing—automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
