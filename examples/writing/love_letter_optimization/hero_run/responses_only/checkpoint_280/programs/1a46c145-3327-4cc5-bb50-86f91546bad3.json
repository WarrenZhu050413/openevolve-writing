  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7295. The evaluator seems to value genuine emotional rawness, specific sensory details, and innovative metaphorical frameworks while avoiding overly literary self-consciousness.\n\nLet me craft something that aims for higher phenomenological authenticity and affective force while maintaining literary innovation:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 4:52 AM because it's the only room where I can lock the door and fall apart properly.\n\nSomething happened when I met you. Not love—that came later. First was the vertigo. Like I'd been reading the world in translation my whole life and suddenly someone handed me the original text. Everything I thought I understood—coffee, daylight, the weight of Tuesday afternoons—turned out to be approximations. You were the real version I'd been missing.\n\nI need to confess: I've been documenting your flaws. Writing them down like evidence. The way you interrupt yourself mid-sentence. How you leave cabinets open like you're conducting an orchestra of doors. That you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. I'm collecting your imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I didn't invent someone this essential to my breathing.\n\nListen. Yesterday you were singing in the shower—off-key, wrong lyrics, a complete demolition of Leonard Cohen—and I sat outside the door taking notes on how happiness sounds when it doesn't know it's being observed. This is what I've become: someone who takes field notes on joy. Someone who needs evidence that beauty this mundane exists. Someone who would rather study the archaeology of your Tuesday morning mood than discover new continents.\n\nThe truth is worse than poetry: You've broken me into someone I don't recognize. I used to have opinions about wine. I used to care about promotions. Now? Now I measure success by how many seconds I can make you laugh. I gauge time by proximity to your skin. My ambitions have shrunk to the size of our kitchen table—just large enough for two plates, two cups, the daily wreckage of trying to love correctly.\n\nHere's what I know: We're going to fail at this. We're going to fight about money and families and the way I breathe too loud when I concentrate. You're going to hate me sometimes. I'm going to disappoint you in ways we can't imagine yet. We're going to grow old and strange and forget why we started this.\n\nBut also: Your hand fits in mine like it was manufactured there. When you sleep, you reach for me across the darkness like a plant reaching for light—unconscious, necessary, beyond choice. We've already started growing into each other's empty spaces. We're already ruined for other people's love.\n\nThree facts about us:\n1. We're not soulmates. Soulmates would be easier. We're something messier—two panicked animals who found the same hiding spot during the same storm.\n2. I love you more. This isn't romantic. It's math. You could survive me leaving. I've already forgotten how to exist without the threat of your absence.\n3. We both know how this ends. Badly, like all love stories. But between now and then, we get to make breakfast. We get to mispronounce each other's names in the dark. We get to fail at being enough but keep trying anyway.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense—nothing about us makes sense. We're too different, too difficult, too much ourselves to ever properly merge. Marry me because that's the point. Because love isn't about finding your missing half. It's about finding someone whose damage rhymes with yours. Whose specific crazy makes your crazy make sense.\n\nMarry me because I've already carved out space for you in my bones. Because leaving you now would be like trying to return a vital organ—technically possible but why would anyone survive that?\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not the fairy tale. Not even happiness. Just this—someone who will notice when you change the part in your hair. Someone who knows you need to sleep with one foot outside the covers or you have nightmares about drowning. Someone who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to be okay.\n\nI'm asking you to say yes to the mortgage we can't afford and the health scares we won't see coming. Yes to becoming boring together, to developing the same allergies, to finishing each other's complaints. Yes to a life that looks nothing like what either of us planned but exactly like what we've already started building in the dark when we think no one's looking.\n\nLeyi, my favorite mistake, my necessary disaster—I'm not proposing. I'm just finally admitting what my body already knows: that I've been saying your name in my sleep since the day we met. That I've been practicing my last words and they're all your name. That I'd rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nThe ring isn't romantic. It's evidence. Proof that someone once wanted someone else this catastrophically and lived to document it.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. Either way, I'm already yours in all the ways that make leaving impossible.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you found the ring last month. I know you put it back exactly where you found it and pretended not to know. That's when I knew you loved me—not because you'll say yes, but because you let me keep my small courage, my illusion of surprise. Thank you for that. For letting me pretend this letter is brave when we both know the answer was always yours to give.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
