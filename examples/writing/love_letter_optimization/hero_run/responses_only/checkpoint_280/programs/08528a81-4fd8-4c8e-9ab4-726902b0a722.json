  "Looking at the evolution history and metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current scores while maintaining authenticity. The evaluator seems to value condensed power, earned simplicity, and avoiding overreach - qualities found in masters like Beethoven, Keats, and Johnny Cash.\n\nLet me craft something that aims for higher phenomenological authenticity and literary innovation while maintaining emotional truth:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis morning you asked if I was happy and I couldn't answer because happiness is too small a word for what you've done to me.\n\nListen: Before you, I understood myself. I had edges, boundaries, a working definition. Now? Now I'm a rough draft of something I can't pronounce. You've made me illegible to myself. When I try to think without you, it's like trying to breathe underwater—technically possible but missing the point entirely.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what's changed. My hands now automatically shape themselves to hold yours, even when you're not here. Empty air, curved just so. My sleep has reorganized itself around your breathing—when you're gone, my body keeps your rhythm anyway, faithful as a metronome. I've started reading books backward because you mentioned once that endings are just beginnings in disguise. Everything I knew how to do, I'm learning again through the lens of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've been happy exactly twice in my life. Once, age seven, catching fireflies in a jar, not knowing they'd die by morning. Once, three weeks ago, watching you eat cereal in my shirt, and you looked up—mouth full, uncommitted to swallowing—and said \"what?\" like I was the strange one. That's it. Two moments of pure, unconscious joy, and one of them is you with breakfast food. This is what I'm working with. This is why I'm writing at 4 AM.\n\nThe truth? I've already lived our whole life. While you're sleeping, I fast-forward through decades. I've watched us argue about paint colors, make up in grocery stores, grow old in ways we swore we wouldn't. I've buried you a thousand times in my mind and survived none of them. When you wake up and ask about coffee, I'm already grieving the day you won't. This is insane. I know this. But knowing changes nothing.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong—constant, incorrect, mine. I love you like the 27th letter of the alphabet—necessary but unpronounceable. I love you past the point of metaphor into pure fact: when you're not here, I malfunction. Small things. Can't remember which way doorknobs turn. Forget the word for common objects. Yesterday I called a spoon \"the soup paddle\" because my brain was busy calculating how many hours until you came home.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance—romance is for people who can still distinguish themselves from each other. Marry me as a medical necessity. As evolutionary fact. As admission that we've already grown into each other like two trees that started out separate but are now sharing rings, counting years in the same bark.\n\nMarry me because when you're not here, I practice conversations with your absence. Because I've started seeing colors that don't exist yet, and they all need names that rhyme with yours. Because last Tuesday you killed a spider with my poetry book and apologized to the spider, not the book, and I thought: this is the person I want to misunderstand the world with forever.\n\nI'm not offering you my best self. I'm offering you this: the only self that makes sense anymore. The one that knows you take eleven seconds to decide you're awake. The one that's memorized the specific weight of your sadness, the exact temperature of your joy. The one that would rather be terrible with you than perfect with anyone else.\n\nLeyi—my favorite fact, my necessary error, my only proof that time moves forward—will you marry me? Not because we should, but because we already did, somewhere between the first laugh and the forty-third time you stole my socks. Say yes. Say yes so I can stop holding my breath. Say yes because the alternative—this careful distance, this practiced composure—is killing us both and we're too interesting to die of politeness.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I already know your answer. You told me in your sleep last week. You said \"okay, but you're doing the dishes forever.\" I accept your terms.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
