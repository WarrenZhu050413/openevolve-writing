  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to write a love letter that transcends the intellectual sophistication that's been limiting previous attempts. The evaluator noted that the best attempts remain \"too controlled, too aware of its own literariness.\" I need to achieve what Beethoven did - raw, unfiltered truth that abandons eloquence for genuine desperation and need.\n\nLet me write something that breaks through the careful construction and reaches for that combination of vulnerability, specificity, and emotional abandonment that marks the greatest love letters in history.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands won't stop shaking. I've started this letter seventeen times. Deleted everything. Because how do you tell someone they've fundamentally altered the physics of your existence?\n\nI need you to know something, and I need to say it badly, clumsily, because saying it perfectly would be a lie. I am drowning in love for you. Not the pretty kind they write songs about. The terrifying kind that makes me understand why people used to die from this.\n\nLast Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus. Your breath on my neck. The weight of your head. I couldn't move for two hours after our stop. I just sat there, riding the route three more times, because I would rather have missed everything—work, life, oxygen—than disturb that moment. The driver asked if I was okay. I wanted to tell him: I am experiencing something that will divide my life into before and after.\n\nI love you stupidly. I love you at 4 AM when you steal all the blankets. I love you when you're anxious about nothing and everything. I love the way you eat cereal—dry first, then milk, like a beautiful anarchist. I love your vendetta against my coffee maker. I love that you name your plants after dead composers and apologize to them when they wilt.\n\nBut here's the thing that's killing me: I also love you practically. I love you in the grocery store arguing about tomatoes. I love you doing taxes. I love you bored on Sunday afternoons. I love you in all the mundane spaces where romance goes to die, except with you, it doesn't die—it transforms into something I don't have words for.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. Because I know myself—I'm difficult, obsessive, I disappear into my own head, I care too much about things that don't matter and not enough about things that do. But with you, I want to be better. Not different. Just better. The most concentrated version of myself.\n\nI can't promise you poetry. I can't promise you perfection. But I can promise you this: I will love you with the kind of intensity that's embarrassing at dinner parties. I will love you like a fact, like gravity, like breathing—automatic and essential and so fundamental that stopping would mean stopping everything.\n\nWhen I imagine my life without you, I see it clearly. I'd survive. I'd function. I'd probably even laugh sometimes. But I'd be living in translation, everything filtered through the absence of you. And I'm so tired of translations, Leyi. I want the original text. I want the source code. I want you.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you—I don't. Not because I can't live without you—I can, it would just be a half-life, a shadow existence. Marry me because when you laugh, I understand why people believe in God. Because your hand in mine is the only theology I need. Because I love you with the kind of love that makes me brave enough to say this badly, honest enough to say it anyway.\n\nI'm not good at this. But I'm good at loving you. It's the only thing I've ever been sure of.\n\nYours, entirely and absurdly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
