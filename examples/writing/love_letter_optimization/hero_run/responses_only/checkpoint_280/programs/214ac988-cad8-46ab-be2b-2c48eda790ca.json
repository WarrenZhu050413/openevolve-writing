  "Looking at this love letter generator, I need to enhance its emotional authenticity and literary depth while maintaining the same function signature. The current version scores 0.6995, and I'll aim to improve all four dimensions through more vulnerable, specific details and innovative narrative techniques.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. Not from fear—from the weight of finally telling you what my body has known since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder during that documentary about penguins. You drooled a little. I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing—you know the thing—where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident—some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong—too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary—like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")—and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation—of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home—will you marry me? Not because I deserve you (I don't), but because I've already started living in our future, and it's the only address I ever want to have.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say yes. You already whispered it in your sleep last Thursday. I've been carrying that \"yes\" around like a locket ever since.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
