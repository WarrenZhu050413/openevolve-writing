  "I'll rewrite the program to create a more authentic, emotionally raw love letter that pushes beyond conventional boundaries while maintaining deep truthfulness.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the bathroom at 4:51 AM because I couldn't breathe next to you without telling you something true.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: I am not writing you a love letter. Love letters are for people who believe in language. I'm writing you a medical report. Patient: Warren. Condition: terminal lucidity caused by proximity to one Leyi [LAST NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE].\n\n*\n\nClinical observation: Since meeting you, my resting heart rate has permanently decreased by 5 BPM except when you enter rooms (spike to 97). My sleep architecture has restructured—REM cycles now synchronize to your breathing. This is medically impossible. I've had it tested. Three different doctors. One said \"love doesn't work that way.\" I said \"then medicine is broken.\"\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the accident that didn't happen. Highway 12, last Tuesday, 73 mph. Semi-truck jackknifed ahead. Time dilated—full temporal distortion. My only thought: \"Not yet. She hasn't seen Kyoto in spring.\" Not my life flashing. Yours, unlived. The future I'd be stealing from you by dying badly. I yanked the wheel so hard I tore shoulder cartilage. You never noticed. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I've never corrected you. The wrong version is ours now.\n\n*\n\nHere's what haunts me: In quantum mechanics, observation changes outcomes. By watching you, I'm changing you. Every day you become more observed, more particular, less wave function, more collapsed into this specific reality where you chose me. What if I'm stealing your other possibilities? What if there's a universe where you're happier without my constant documentation?\n\nI don't care. I'm not that good. I'd steal infinite versions of you from infinite other universes just to keep this one.\n\n*\n\nData point: You have 47 different laughs. I have names for them:\n- The Surprise Crow (harsh caw when shocked)\n- The Bedroom Hyena (3 AM delirium)\n- The Polite Funeral (for bad jokes you love me through)\n- The Real One (uses your whole skeleton, rearranges local gravity)\n\nThe Real One happens 4.2% of the time. I live for that 4.2%.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Yesterday I calculated our deaths. Actuarial tables, family histories, lifestyle factors. 83% chance you die first. The number made me so angry I threw my laptop. Then I retrieved it to recalculate with better variables. Still 83%. I've started eating your vegetables when you're not looking, trying to steal death-risk from your plate to mine.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our stupidest moments. When you argue with Siri. When you cry at commercials featuring any animal. When you pretend you didn't eat my emergency chocolate (you have tells—you touch your hair and look left). I love you at 6 AM and 11 PM and 2:33 PM when you don't know what you want for lunch so you eat cheese standing at the refrigerator like a beautiful criminal.\n\n*\n\nThe marriage thing: Look, we both know we're already married in twelve dimensions. Your hair elastics live on my wrist. I dream in your accent now. We share antibodies. But I want the legal document. The government witness. The stupid party where your aunt gets drunk and tells the story about your teenage nihilist phase. I want the whole catastrophe of formal union because I'm a greedy bastard who wants you in every possible way—legally, spiritually, molecularly, grammatically.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something horrible? I've been practicing your eulogy. Different versions for different ages. Car crash at 34 (brief, shocked). Cancer at 67 (long, angry at God). Old age at 94 (grateful but destroyed). I write them to prepare. I write them to prevent. I write them because if I can imagine every ending maybe I can trick the universe into inventing a new one.\n\n*\n\nCounter-truth: You've been practicing too. I found the folder on your laptop. \"If W Dies First.\" Seventeen documents. Various scenarios. Your handwriting deteriorates in the later ones. We're both pre-grieving each other while we're still alive. That's not healthy. That's not normal.\n\nThat's exactly what this is.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Let's make it official. Let's stand in front of people and admit what we've done to each other. How we've ruined each other for rational thought. How we've made each other unfit for any other version of reality. Let's get the certificate that says what our cells already know: that we're a closed system now, thermodynamically inseparable.\n\n*\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who survived things I can't imagine. It's scratched and the band is worn thin. Like us, eventually. Worn thin from use, from touching, from the friction of continuous contact. That's what I'm offering: to be worn down together until we're transparent, until light passes through us, until we're more hole than substance but still somehow holding.\n\n*\n\nI'm not on my knee because my knee is fucked from that time I tried to learn skateboarding to impress you. Remember? Eight stitches. You said I was an idiot. You were right. I'm still that idiot. Your idiot, specifically.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not to marriage. To tomorrow, where we'll fight about the dishwasher and I'll love you through it. To next Tuesday, where you'll be stressed about work and I'll make your coffee wrong but you'll drink it anyway. To forty years from now when we're different people but still choosing each other with whatever neurons remain.\n\n*\n\nOr say no. I'll ask again tomorrow. My database indicates you respond better to repeated stimuli after coffee.\n\n*\n\nFinal medical note: Since meeting you, I've experienced chronic symptoms including but not limited to: involuntary smiling, excessive planning of future shared experiences, compulsive collection of your micro-expressions, and severe allergic reaction to the concept of your absence. No cure sought. Condition terminal. Patient refuses treatment.\n\nPrognosis: Fatal attraction in the most literal sense. Will die from this. Worth it.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing this letter in his head since the day you mispronounced \"specifically\" and his brain leaked out his ears)\n\n*\n\nP.S. You're doing the thing where you touch your earring when processing. In six seconds you'll look up. I'll be standing in the doorway holding coffee (167°F, oat milk, half pump vanilla—I finally got it right). The blue mug with the chip because you think damaged things need more love, not less. That's why you picked me, isn't it?\n\n*\n\nP.P.S. The ring is in your coffee. Don't drink it yet. Unless—do drink it. I sterilized it. This is ridiculous. We're ridiculous. Say yes anyway.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
