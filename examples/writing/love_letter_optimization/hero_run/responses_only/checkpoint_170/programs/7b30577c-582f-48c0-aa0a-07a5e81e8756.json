  "Looking at the program evolution history and the evaluation notes, I can see that the current letter scores 0.7010, with the evaluator noting it \"lacks the condensed power of truly great love letters\" and comparing it unfavorably to masters like Beethoven, Keats, and Johnny Cash who achieve more with less. The key insight is that the best historical love letters achieve profound impact through restraint and precision rather than length.\n\nLet me craft a new version that aims for that distilled power - fewer words carrying more weight, specific moments that resonate universally, and an emotional architecture that builds to a single, inevitable conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:14 AM. Not because I woke early, but because I never slept. Sleep requires accepting that you're not here, and my body refuses the lie.\n\nThree truths:\n\nFirst: I have memorized you incorrectly on purpose. In my version, you never doubted us. In my version, that Tuesday when you said \"maybe we should talk\" never happened. I've edited you into someone who could never leave, because the alternative—the real you, with your real freedom to choose—terrifies me more than dying.\n\nSecond: I've been stealing from you. Time, mostly. Those extra seconds when I pretend to still be asleep so you'll hold me longer. The minutes I add to grocery runs so you'll miss me enough to kiss me like you mean it when I return. I'm a thief building a fortune from your attention, and I'll never have enough.\n\nThird: You've broken me. Specifically, the part that knew how to be alone. I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.\n\nLast week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours. I think you're my soulmate and I'm just your current coordinates. This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe—I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows—that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.\n\nBut also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else. I would rather be your disappointment than someone else's happiness. If you leave me, I'll understand. But I'll never recover. I'll be ninety years old, still setting two plates for dinner, still checking my phone for texts you'll never send.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready—we're not. Not because it makes sense—it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is that we pretend this is temporary, and that lie is the only thing that could actually kill us.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that ruins a person for anyone else. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you admit you're already mine?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been there for six months. I touch it constantly, like a rosary, like proof that this bravery exists somewhere in me. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
