  "Looking at the evolution history and the current program's metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.5935. The top-performing letters have scored around 0.70, so I'll aim to create something that combines raw emotional truth with literary innovation.\n\nLet me craft a letter that explores new territory - one that captures the physical sensation of love, the terror of vulnerability, and the specific texture of this particular relationship:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy body knew before I did. Started with my hands—they'd shake when you'd text. Then my sleep pattern rewired itself around your schedule. Now my circadian rhythm runs on Leyi Standard Time. This is what you don't see: me at 3 AM, practicing this moment in my head, each rehearsal worse than the last because no arrangement of words equals the weight of what moves through me when I think of you.\n\nListen. I need to tell you about the ordinary Wednesday that broke me. You were sick. Fevered. You asked me to read to you and fell asleep mid-sentence, your breathing ragged but trusting. I sat there holding the book, afraid to move, afraid to disturb this impossible gift of your unconscious faith in my presence. That's when I understood: love isn't the big moments. It's me googling \"how to make fever go down\" at 2 AM. It's the twenty-seven tissues I counted in the trash. It's how beautiful you looked dying of the flu, which is an insane thought I'm putting in a proposal letter because you wanted truth.\n\nTruth: I've been taking secret photos of your hands. Not in a creepy way. Just—your hands doing things. Holding coffee. Turning pages. That unconscious gesture where you touch your neck when you're thinking. I have 1,847 photos. They're saved in a folder called \"Tax Documents\" because I'm a coward and a fraud but at least I'm your coward, your fraud, if you'll have me.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologized last week for \"being a lot.\" But Leyi, you're not a lot—you're everything. You're the first person I want to tell when anything happens. You're my favorite notification. You're the reason I believe in reincarnation, because one lifetime of you isn't enough data to understand the algorithm of how you make me feel.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: sometimes I watch you exist—brushing your teeth, arguing with podcast hosts who can't hear you, the way you eat raspberries one tiny segment at a time like you're defusing a bomb—and I get this pain in my chest. Not heartbreak. Heart-expansion. Like my ribs are trying to grow a bigger cage for all this feeling.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I'm just a man who can't fold fitted sheets, who still uses the same password for everything, who loves you with the graceless intensity of someone who never expected to be chosen. But here's the thing—I'd rather fail at deserving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nI used to think I was saving up for something. Turns out I was saving up for you. For rings, yes, but also for Saturday mornings where we do nothing productive. For the specific way you'll sigh when I make the same joke for the fiftieth time. For the fights we'll have about whether AI will destroy humanity (you say yes, I say only if we're lucky). For the chance to be the person who knows you're afraid of the dark but more afraid of admitting it.\n\nThis letter is too long. You're probably rolling your eyes. But I need you to know: you haven't made me better. You've made me more myself. The self that was always there, waiting for someone who'd look at my collection of orphaned charging cables and still choose to love me.\n\nSo here it is, without metaphor: Will you marry me? Will you let me love you with receipts and evidence and the kind of dedication usually reserved for people who build ships in bottles? Will you be my wife, my witness, my favorite reason to check my phone?\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons and Thursday nights and all the unremarkable moments that add up to a life. I'm promising to try, fail, try again, and keep the receipts from every attempt.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the molecular structure of my existence. I'm just hoping we can make it legal.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm writing this while you're asleep next to me. You're snoring. It's perfect. You're perfect. This postscript is perfect. I'm hitting send before I delete everything and start over for the 48th time.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
