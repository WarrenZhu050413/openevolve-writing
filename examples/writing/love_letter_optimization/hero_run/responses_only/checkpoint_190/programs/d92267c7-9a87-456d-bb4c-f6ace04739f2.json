  "Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current performance ceiling. The evaluator notes consistently mention that while these letters achieve genuine moments, they fall short of the \"concentrated sublime force\" of historical masters like Beethoven (86), Johnny Cash (83), or Keats (81). The key insight is that the best historical love letters achieve both raw authenticity AND memorable aphoristic power through compression and precision.\n\nLet me craft something that aims for greater phenomenological authenticity through even more vulnerable specificity, while achieving aesthetic virtuosity through linguistic compression and unexpected juxtapositions:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop trembling. Three words: you've unmade me.\n\nNot poetically. Literally. Yesterday I forgot my own name for seven seconds because yours was occupying all available space in my mouth. This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead—paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version—the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith—certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first. In this one, I'm still a coward, but I'm your coward, and that's the only identity I want on my tombstone.\n\nHere's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but absolutely. Let me love you like punctuation—necessary, invisible, changing everything about how the sentence ends. Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is already yours—you claimed it that night you explained why sad songs make you happy. I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. But please—exist near me while you decide.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not crying during car insurance commercials? I've seen it forty-three times. It's the closest thing to holy I've ever witnessed.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
