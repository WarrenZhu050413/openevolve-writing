  "Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current score of 0.6965 while maintaining authenticity and emotional depth. The evaluator seems to value specific, visceral details combined with philosophical depth, avoiding clichés while maintaining genuine vulnerability.\n\nLet me craft something that balances raw honesty with literary sophistication, incorporating elements that worked well (specific details, temporal anxiety, vulnerability) while pushing into new territory.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with a mechanical pencil you left here six months ago. The eraser is gone. You used it all up fixing crossword mistakes. This feels important somehow—that even your erasures leave marks on my life.\n\nLet me start with what terrifies me: I understand now why people used to die from love. Not metaphorically. Literally. Your absence causes a specific pain behind my sternum, like my ribs are trying to grow around an empty space shaped exactly like you. Medieval physicians called it \"dying of a broken heart.\" They were right. The body knows what the mind won't admit—that some losses are incompatible with continued function.\n\nBut you're not lost. You're here, reading this, and that's the second terror: that you'll say yes. That I'll get to keep you. That forty years from now I'll still be discovering new ways you pronounce words when you're sleepy, new foods you're secretly afraid of, new songs that make you cry in grocery stores. The prospect of that much happiness feels like standing at the edge of an ocean I'm not sure I'm strong enough to swim.\n\nTuesday. 2:17 PM. You were peeling an orange and said, abruptly, \"I don't think I believe in myself today.\" I wanted to tell you that I believe in you enough for both of us, but that's not true. I don't believe in you—belief implies doubt. I know you the way I know gravity. You're not a theory. You're a law.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about marriage proposals: The ring is the least important part. What matters is this—I've started seeing time differently since you. Not as days or years, but as a finite number of times I'll watch you brush your teeth. Maybe 14,000 more times, if we're lucky. 14,000 times watching you spit toothpaste and make that face where you check if you got everything. That's not enough. I need more data points. More mornings where you steal all the hot water. More nights where you tell me the entire plot of a book you're reading while I pretend I'm not falling asleep. More, more, more. I'm greedy for the mundane repetitions of you.\n\nMy therapist says I have an anxious attachment style. She's wrong. I have a Leyi attachment style. It's highly specific. Symptoms include: checking if you've texted while I'm mid-conversation with others, saving the voice message where you laugh at your own joke about dolphins, and an inability to throw away the grocery list you wrote on the back of a CVS receipt three months ago because your handwriting looks happy that day.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I watch you exist and feel furious. Furious that you were living an entire life before I knew you. Twenty-seven years of you laughing at jokes I didn't tell, crying over things I couldn't fix, learning to ride a bike or kiss or make coffee—all without me. It's irrational. It's possessive. It's the truth. I want retroactive ownership of your past and exclusive rights to your future. I want to be grandfathered into every memory you have.\n\nBut I also want to earn you. Daily. I want to wake up every morning and re-win you through a thousand tiny victories: remembering that you hate the word \"moist,\" never using your coffee mug (the one with the chip that you claim adds character), knowing to be quiet but present when your mother calls and you speak in Mandarin and your voice gets younger. I want to deserve you in installments, one day at a time, until one of us stops breathing.\n\nThe night my grandmother died, she looked at my grandfather and said, \"I would have liked more time.\" They were married sixty-one years. Sixty-one years and her last words were about wanting more. That's what I'm offering you—a lifetime of not enough. Because there's no amount of time that would be sufficient. We could have centuries and I'd still be asking for one more Tuesday.\n\nSo here's the data: You hum when you're nervous. You read the last page of books first when you're anxious. You still text your dead friend's number when good things happen. You're afraid of butterflies but not moths. You cry at every single Pixar movie, including the shorts. You've been carrying the same lucky penny since 2019. It's not lucky—you just can't throw things away. You're the only person I know who apologizes to automated phone systems. You eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. You love me despite compelling evidence that you shouldn't.\n\nThat last one is the miracle. Not that I love you—anyone with functioning neurons would love you. But that you love me back? That's the glitch in the matrix. That's the thing that makes me believe in something larger than randomness.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already moved me. Geologically. Tectonically. I'm a different landscape now. There are Leyi-shaped canyons carved through my center. Marry me because the alternative—existing in a universe where you're not my wife—feels like a clerical error I need to correct.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a circle in the fabric. Some days I forget it's there, and then I remember, and the remembering feels like discovering gravity exists—sudden, crushing, absolutely true.\n\nI love you. Those words are too small. It's like calling the sun \"warm\" or the ocean \"wet.\" Accurate but insufficient. I love you in ways that require new words. I love you kaleidoscopically, ****ographically, molecularly. I love you past tense, present tense, subjunctive tense—in tenses that haven't been invented yet for the ways I'll love you tomorrow.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the quantum entanglement of us. To the statistical impossibility that we've already become. Say yes to Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings and all the unremarkable moments where we'll practice being married until we're good at it, then keep practicing anyway because the practicing is the point.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say this letter is too long. You're right. But how do you compress a universe into an envelope? How do you write briefly about infinity? You don't. You just hand over everything and hope the weight of it means something. This is me, handing over everything. This is all my words, asking for all your days.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
