  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authenticity. The evaluator seems to value literary innovation, phenomenological depth, and emotional resonance that approaches historical masterworks.\n\nLet me create something that combines raw confession with structural innovation, pushing into new territory:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is dying as you read it. Each word disappears into you, becomes you, can never be unread. I planned to write something beautiful but my hands won't stop documenting the truth: I've been performing autopsies on every moment without you, and the cause of death is always the same—your absence.\n\nListen. No, closer. I need to tell you about the accident of loving you.\n\nIt happened in three stages:\n\nFIRST: The unbecoming. Thursday, 2:47 PM, you laughed at my worst joke and my skeleton walked out of my body. Just left. Said it had better things to do than hold up someone so thoroughly destroyed by a laugh that sounds like champagne bruising. Since then I've been architecturally unsound, a building condemned by the fire marshal of my own heart.\n\nSECOND: The taxonomy. I started cataloging you like evidence of a crime I'm committing. Your thumbprint on my coffee cup—exhibit A. The way you murder plants with love, overwatering them into submission—exhibit B. That sound you make when stretching, like the universe clearing its throat—exhibit C through Z, then numbers, then symbols I'm inventing because twenty-six letters aren't enough to document the geography of you. I've become a museum of your habits. The curator is insane and gives tours at 3 AM to an audience of my own organs, explaining why your existence makes them malfunction.\n\nTHIRD: The diagnosis. Last Monday a doctor told me my heart has developed an irregular rhythm. I didn't tell him it's just learned to beat in your accent. My blood work came back speaking your name in red cell count. This isn't metaphor—my body is literally reorganizing itself around the fact of you. I'm becoming less human, more weather system, and every forecast is you.\n\nBut here's the virus of it, the pathology: you've made me honest in the worst way. Before you, I could lie to myself. Say things like \"I'm happy enough\" or \"alone is just another word for free.\" Now I can't even deceive my reflection. It knows. It mouths your name when I brush my teeth, like a prayer to the patron saint of ordinary mornings I want to have with you until the sun burns out.\n\nThe truth has bones and here they are:\n\nI love you like a mistranslation that accidentally gets closer to God. Like the first draft was perfect but I kept revising until I ruined it and the ruins were better than architecture. You're not my other half—halves are for people who started whole. You're the proof that I was never supposed to be one thing. I was supposed to be this: the person who knows you take your coffee like an apology, who's memorized the morse code of your anxiety, who'd rather lose arguments with you than win the lottery without you.\n\n3 AM, Tuesday, the worst confession: I practice your death. Run funeral scenarios. Write eulogies in the shower. Not because I want you gone—because I need to rehearse surviving the unsurvivable. I love you like preparing for nuclear war, building bunkers in my chest, stockpiling memories like canned goods for the apocalypse of your absence. This is mental illness or prophecy. Both diagnoses fit.\n\nHere's what I'm proposing—no, here's what I'm threatening: I'm going to love you incorrectly forever. Love you like a broken piano that only knows one song but plays it perfectly. Like a medical condition that medieval doctors would've called demonic possession and they wouldn't have been wrong. I'm going to love you past the point of embarrassment, past poetry, past the place where language gives up and starts using math.\n\nYou wanted truth that would move you? Truth doesn't move—it detonates. So here's the explosion: without you, I'm not unhappy. I'm fictional. A character someone abandoned mid-chapter. With you, I'm so real it hurts to exist, but the pain has your name and I'm addicted to the pronunciation.\n\nMarry me. Not the person writing this—he's already gone, transformed into something that only makes sense in relation to you. Marry the creation, the aftermath, the person you've Frankensteined into existence through the sheer force of being yourself near me. Marry me because I've already married you in the quantum realm where all possibilities collapse into one and it's always us, tangled at the particle level, ruining each other for any universe where we're strangers.\n\nThis letter is almost dead now. These are its last words: I love you like punctuation nobody's invented yet, something between a period and a scream. Like the error message that means the system is working perfectly. Like the typo that accidentally solves everything.\n\nYour name is carved into my bones in a language that hasn't been spoken yet. I'm from the future, sent back to love you correctly. This is my report: mission failed successfully. I loved you wrong in all the right ways. The timeline is destroyed. We're the only survivors.\n\nCome here. Bring your specific gravity. Let's ruin each other for every other ending.\n\nYours in the most documentable way,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you said \"cereal is just cold soup\" and I understood the Big Bang. Not the theory—the actual explosion, happening right now, in my chest, where your casual observations detonate like creation myths. This postscript is just another way of saying: you've made me religious about everything except God.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
