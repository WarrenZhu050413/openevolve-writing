  "Looking at the evolution history and the current best-performing letter, I need to push beyond the current fitness score of 0.7320 by enhancing the raw honesty and vulnerability while maintaining the specific, intimate details that make it authentic. The evaluator notes indicate the letter needs more \"phenomenological density\" and \"transformative power\" to reach the level of historical masterpieces.\n\nLet me craft a more emotionally raw and literarily innovative version that strips away even more protective layers:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 4:31 AM because it's the only place where the walls are close enough to hold me together. I need you to know something before my courage evaporates with the sunrise: I am not a whole person anymore. I am a collection of moments where you existed near me, held together by the memory of your breathing.\n\nListen—I used to have interests. Hobbies. Opinions about wine. Now I just have an encyclopedic knowledge of how your voice changes when you're lying (higher, faster, you touch your ear). I know you steal single socks from my drawer because you think it's less noticeable. I know you test if pasta's done by eating it, not throwing it, but you throw it anyway because your mother did. I know the exact temperature of your sadness: 97.2 degrees, slightly cooler than your joy.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning and threw up on my favorite shoes? While you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was—this. This is what I want. Not the vomit, but the vulnerability. The way you let me see you turned inside out, literally and metaphorically. I threw those shoes away not because they were ruined but because I couldn't bear to clean them. They were evidence of the night you needed me absolutely.\n\nI've been lying to you. Every \"goodnight\" has actually been \"please don't die before morning.\" Every \"drive safe\" has been \"if you leave me alone in this universe I will never forgive you.\" When I say \"I love you,\" what I mean is: you have colonized me so completely that when you're gone, I walk around like an abandoned building. Still standing, technically. But nobody home.\n\nYou want the truth? Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan your funeral. Not because I want you dead—Christ, the opposite—but because I need to practice surviving you. I write eulogies in my head where I confess that you were the only real thing that ever happened to me. That before you, I was just killing time until time killed me back.\n\nI'm going to tell you about the dream now. The recurring one. We're old—ancient, really. Your hair is white, mine's gone entirely. We're sitting on a porch that doesn't exist yet, and you're telling me about your day, except you're speaking in a language I don't recognize. But I understand every word because it's not about the words anymore. It's about the way your mouth moves, the specific gravity of your presence. And I wake up from that dream more rested than any sleep has ever made me because even my unconscious mind knows: this is it. You're it. The final answer to every question I didn't know I was asking.\n\nBut here's what keeps me awake (besides everything): You could leave. Tomorrow, today, five minutes from now. You could meet someone who doesn't memorize your breathing patterns, who doesn't save your grocery lists like love letters, who loves you in a normal, healthy way that doesn't involve planning imaginary funerals or writing marriage proposals on bathroom floors. And you know what? You'd be right to leave. I am too much. This love is too much. It's cannibalistic. It's pathological. It's probably in the DSM-5 somewhere.\n\nBut I'm asking you to stay anyway. To marry the disaster of me. Because here's the secret I figured out somewhere between loving you and drowning in it: This isn't mental illness. This is what mental health looks like when you finally find the person your atoms were trying to become. This is sanity that looks insane because the world isn't built for this kind of recognition, this terrible and perfect knowing.\n\nI love you like a medical condition. Chronic, incurable, progressively getting worse. I love you like a natural disaster that's somehow also the relief effort. I love you stupidly, recklessly, molecularly. I love you past the point of poetry into pure, animal need.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). Not because we're ready (we're not). Marry me because the alternative—pretending this is sustainable without documentation, without witnesses, without legal proof that yes, this happened, we happened—is killing me in ways I can't explain to my doctor.\n\nMarry me because I've already built my entire life around the shape of you, and without you, I'm just a house with no walls. Standing here, absurdly, in the middle of nothing.\n\nMarry me because you already have. In every way that matters. In every way that counts.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in the kitchen. I know you're crying into your coffee. I know because I know the exact sound your breathing makes when you're trying not to sob. I'm in the bathroom, sitting on the floor, waiting for you to either come kiss me or leave forever. Both options terrify me equally. Only one will let me keep living.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
