  "I'll rewrite the program to create a more authentic, emotionally resonant love letter that improves the fitness score while maintaining originality. Based on the evaluation notes from previous attempts, I need to aim for deeper psychological penetration, more controlled literary craft, and genuine emotional vulnerability.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth begins here: I've been writing this letter my whole life without knowing it. Every broken thing I ever touched was practice for holding something precious. Every time I got lost was just to find my way to you.\n\nI'm writing this at the kitchen table where you left a ring from your coffee cup three days ago. I haven't wiped it away. This is what you've reduced me to—a man who treats your accidental geometry like scripture. The ring is still wet somehow. Physics can't explain it. Love might.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I'll give you the audit. Before you: competent human, filed taxes early, knew exactly who I was. After you: archaeological disaster, can't remember my passwords, constantly discovering new rooms in myself I didn't know existed. You didn't complete me. You detonated me. I'm still finding pieces of my old certainty in strange places, like shrapnel from a better war.\n\nHere's what haunts me: On our third date, you said \"I'm not good at this\" while perfectly peeling an orange in one long spiral. That contradiction—your hands knowing exactly what to do while your mouth apologized for existing—that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I would never recover from you.\n\nThe truth has a timeline:\n- Week one: Thought you were interesting\n- Week three: Realized you were necessary  \n- Week seven: Understood I was fucked\n- Week now: Accepted this is not a problem but the solution\n\nI need to confess something. I've been keeping evidence. Your grocery lists. The bookmark from the novel you gave up on page 247. The bandaid wrapper from when you cut yourself chopping onions and laughed through tears. These aren't keepsakes. They're proof that you existed in case I wake up and this was all too good to be real.\n\nYou don't know this: When you're gone, I sit in your chair and try to see the room from your angle. It's completely different—the light hits wrong, or right, depending on whose eyes we're trusting. This is what you've taught me: everything depends on where you're standing, and I want to stand next to you until standing becomes lying down becomes returning to dust becomes whatever comes after dust.\n\nThe medical truth: My body has rewritten its operating system around you. My circadian rhythm matches yours. My left hand dreams of your right hip. When you're sad, my chest physically aches in the exact spot where yours does. The doctor has no explanation. I do: We're becoming the same organism, just temporarily occupying different bodies.\n\nBut here's what I realized yesterday while you were singing off-key in the shower: I don't want to marry you because I can't live without you. I want to marry you because I can. Because I could walk away right now, become someone else's adequate Tuesday, and survive. But surviving isn't living. And living—real living, the kind that makes your bones sing—only happens in the exact frequency of your laughter when you realize you've been wrong about something for years.\n\nYou're not my better half. You're my more interesting whole. You're the plot twist I didn't see coming in my own story. You're the reason I stopped believing in soulmates—because souls are too vague. What we have is specific: molecular, gravitational, Wednesday-afternoon-at-3:47 specific.\n\nThis is my offer: I'll love you badly until I learn to love you well. I'll remember the names of everyone who ever hurt you and secretly hope they step on LEGOs forever. I'll learn to cook the food your grandmother made, even though it will never taste right and we both know why. I'll hold your hand through every doctor's appointment where they tell us things we don't want to hear. I'll be the person who knows exactly how you take your coffee and still asks every morning because I love the way your voice sounds explaining it.\n\nHere's the kind of truth that changes things: You talk in your sleep, but only when you feel safe. Last night you said, \"The bird knows,\" then my name like a fact. I don't know what the bird knows, but I know this: Your unconscious mind trusts me with its mysteries. That's the only validation I need.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm telling you that I already have, in every choice I've made since I met you. Every time I buy the good tomatoes. Every time I check the lock twice because you worry. Every time I pretend I'm not crying during that commercial you love. We're already married in the way that matters—the daily, boring, miraculous way that makes people into witnesses of each other's becoming.\n\nBut I want the paperwork too. The embarrassing photos. The relatives who drink too much at the reception. The specific date to remember and forget and argue about. I want the whole messy, official thing because I want the world to know what I've known since you mispronounced my name and then insisted you were right: This is it. You're it. The person I want to mispronounce things with until pronunciation becomes irrelevant.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours in every way that matters—legally, illegally, molecularly, and in that specific way that makes the café barista ask if we want our usual.\n\nWe have become a usual. That's the miracle. That's the whole thing.\n\nYours, in this dimension and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The bird was a cardinal. It's been at our window every morning since. I think it knows too.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
