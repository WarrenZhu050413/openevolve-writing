Text:
Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current performance while addressing the key weaknesses. The evaluator notes indicate that the best historical attempts (scoring 0.857) had powerful elements but were truncated. The current version at 0.699 is too compressed and lacks the emotional depth needed.

Let me craft something that combines:
1. Raw phenomenological authenticity (like Beethoven's directness)
2. Innovative literary devices beyond conventional romantic discourse
3. Deep affective force that builds through accumulation
4. Aesthetic control without over-literariness
