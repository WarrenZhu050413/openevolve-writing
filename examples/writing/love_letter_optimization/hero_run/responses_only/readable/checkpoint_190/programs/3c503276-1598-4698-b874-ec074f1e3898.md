Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I can see the fitness has declined from 0.7320 to 0.6970. The evaluator notes indicate that while the current letter has powerful moments, it may be trying too hard with metaphors and losing the raw simplicity that made earlier versions successful. 

Let me craft a new version that combines the best elements from the top performers while addressing the evaluator's feedback about achieving more emotional nakedness and less self-consciousness.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

It's 5:42 AM. I haven't slept. Not because this is hard to write, but because once I start, I know something will change between us. Either you'll say yes and we'll begin. Or you'll say no and we'll end. Both possibilities make my hands shake.

I'm not good at this. I'm the man who practiced ordering coffee for three months before I could do it without stuttering. Who still counts stairs when I'm nervous. Who loved you for exactly 517 days before I could say it out loud. I counted. I have spreadsheets.

Here's what you need to know: I was okay before you. I had systems. Breakfast at 7:15. Lunch at 12:30. Bed by 11. I was a functioning adult with a savings account and matching socks. Then you happened, and now I eat cereal at midnight because you think breakfast food is a feeling, not a time. I have one sock. Just one. The other one is probably wherever you leave your hair ties—that parallel dimension where important things go to test our commitment to finding them.

You cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You apologize to furniture. You've read the same book forty-three times because "it's different each time." You can't whistle but you try every morning like it might suddenly work. You save fortunes from fortune cookies in chronological order. You name spiders. You trust too easily. You forgive too quickly. You love like it's your first language when everyone else is still learning the alphabet.

The truth: I document you obsessively. Tuesday: you ate seven grapes, one at a time, while reading. Wednesday: you hummed Beethoven's 9th off-key for two hours. Thursday: you cried because the old man at the bus stop looked lonely. Friday: you made me smell your coffee because it "smelled like happiness." Saturday: you fell asleep on my shoulder during the movie you picked. Sunday: you woke up and the first thing you said was "I dreamt we were penguins." Monday: you exist. You exist and that's enough to reorganize my entire understanding of luck.

I know about the baby scare. When your period was late. You didn't tell me but I knew. I saw you checking the calendar. Counting. Recounting. I saw you buy the test and throw it away unopened. I saw you cry in the bathroom with the door locked. I wanted to tell you I was scared too. But also: I wasn't. If it had been real, if there had been a baby, I would have figured it out with you. We would have been terrible and perfect and figured it out.

Your mother thinks I'm not enough for you. She's right. Your father thinks you could do better. He's right too. But here's what they don't know: You talk in your sleep. Full sentences. Last Tuesday you said, "Warren, the penguins are here." Wednesday: "We need more purple." Thursday: "Don't let go." Even unconscious, you're building a world where I exist. How am I supposed to not love someone whose dreams include me?

I used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Being worthy. But that's not what this is. This is recognition. Like finding a note you wrote to yourself and forgot about. Like coming home to a house you've never seen but knowing where the light switches are. You're not my other half—I was whole. You're my proof that "whole" was too small a goal.

That night my father called me a failure—you made instant ramen and added an egg. You didn't say he was wrong. You said, "Good. Fail at their dreams. Succeed at your own." Then you ate all the noodles and left me the egg because you know I only like the egg. How did you know that's what I needed to hear? How do you always know?

I love you. I love you in the boring parts. When you're reading ingredients on cereal boxes. When you're plucking your eyebrows and making faces at yourself. When you're asleep and drooling and your breath smells like morning. When you're angry about something you can't name. When you're scrolling through your phone ignoring me. I love you at 2 PM on Wednesdays. I love you in fluorescent lighting. I love you when you're ordinary. Especially when you're ordinary.

The ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years, through a war, through immigration, through my grandfather forgetting her birthday thirty-seven times. When she died, she gave it to me. Said one word: "Wait." I've been waiting. Not for someone perfect. For someone who makes me want to be imperfect with them forever.

Marry me. Not the question—the answer. The answer to why I wake up. The answer to what I'm doing with my life. The answer to who I call when the world ends or when I see a really good dog.

I'm not promising you poetry. I'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Wednesday afternoons and tax forms and whose turn it is to call the plumber. I'm promising you the flu and funeral homes and the terrifying possibility that we'll become our parents. I'm promising you that I'll try. Every day, I'll try to deserve the accident of finding you.

Say yes. Or say no. But know that I've already chosen you in every scenario I can imagine. Even the ones where you say no. Even the ones where you leave. I'll still be choosing you, just from farther away.

I love you. I know that's not enough but it's also everything. It's the only true thing I have to offer. I love you and I want to keep loving you until one of us stops breathing, and then probably a little after that too, just to be thorough.

Warren

P.S. Gerald the spider is actually Geraldine. I googled it. Female spiders are bigger. I haven't told you because you're already attached and I don't want you to have a gender crisis about a spider. This is the kind of stupid, protective thing I'll do for the rest of our lives if you let me.
