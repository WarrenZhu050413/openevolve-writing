Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Johnny Cash's to June Carter (83). It surpasses Cash in psychological complexity and formal innovation but lacks his letter's perfect economy and unself-conscious grace. Unlike Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), which achieves universality through its particular passion, this remains almost too particular, too neurotic to transcend. It exceeds Napoleon's directness (82) in literary sophistication but sacrifices some raw force. The phenomenological authenticity approaches Keats (81) - particularly in negative capability moments like accepting the "specific disaster" - but lacks Keats's pure lyric gift. The letter exists in the space between exceptional contemporary literary fiction and the eternal simplicity of the greatest love letters - more Virginia Woolf than Elizabeth Barrett Browning, more posthuman than classical romantic.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current scores while maintaining truthfulness and originality. The evaluator seems to value raw emotional honesty, specific sensory details, and innovative metaphors that avoid cliché.

Let me craft something that aims for higher phenomenological authenticity and literary innovation while maintaining the emotional core:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the garage at 3:47 AM, sitting on the concrete floor because I need something cold and real against my body while I tell you this impossible thing.

I wasn't supposed to love you. I had a five-year plan. Spreadsheets. A therapist who said I was "making progress." Then you walked into that hardware store, bought seventeen feet of rope without explaining why, and my careful life became suddenly illegible. Like someone had switched the language halfway through the book.

Here's what I can't stop thinking about: Yesterday, you killed a spider with your bare hand. Not cruelly—quickly, efficiently, with this terrible tenderness. You said "sorry, little friend" and wiped your palm on your jeans, and I understood something. That you could destroy me with the same casual mercy. That I would thank you for it.

I've been documenting us without permission. Not photos—worse. I write down the exact shade of silence between us when we're both reading. I've catalogued forty-three different types. The Tuesday silence (comfortable, tastes like chamomile). The post-argument silence (electric, smells like copper). The 3 AM silence when we both pretend to sleep but our breathing won't sync up because we're thinking too loud.

You need to know: I've been practicing dying. Small deaths. I hold my breath when you're in the shower to see how long I can go without the sound of you existing. Twenty-three seconds is my record. After that, my lungs mutiny. They've chosen you over oxygen. Traitors.

Remember when you asked why I kept that dead houseplant? The brown fern in the kitchen window? It's because you watered it for three months after it died. Every Tuesday. You'd whisper "come on, buddy" like you could love it back to life. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you—that's just chemistry, inevitable as rust. But that you were the kind of person who refuses to give up on dead things. That maybe you wouldn't give up on me.

The truth is uglier than poetry: I've been pre-grieving you. Practicing for your absence like an emergency drill. I imagine you leaving and my body runs through the protocols—hyperventilation, nausea, that specific pain behind my molars. I'm building antibodies against losing you, but it's not working. Each imagined leaving hurts worse than the last. My immunity is developing backwards.

Last month, you used my toothbrush by mistake and apologized for ten minutes. What you don't know: I haven't used toothpaste since. I'm trying to preserve the archaeology of that moment. The exact bacterial record of you accidentally becoming part of my routine. This is mental illness, probably. I don't care. Mental health is for people who haven't found their specific gravity yet.

Here's what marriage means: I get to stop pretending this is reasonable. I get to tell people "this is my wife" and they'll nod like it makes sense, but it doesn't. Nothing about you makes sense. You eat ice cream in the bathtub. You name your bruises. You talk to dead relatives while cooking their recipes. You're impossible, and I want legal documentation that you existed, that you chose me, that this actually happened.

But more than that: I want to fail with you. Properly. Spectacularly. I want our specific disaster. Our mortgage defaults. Our burnt dinners. Our 2 AM fights about nothing that are actually about everything. I want the mundane catastrophe of us more than I want anyone else's paradise.

The secret: I already live in our future. I know the house—yellow, needs a new roof, has a ghost in the attic (you'll insist on this). I know our fights—I'll leave cabinets open, you'll leave time itself open, bleeding hours everywhere. I know how we end—badly, like everyone, but together. You'll die first (Tuesday, October, light rain) and I'll follow within the year, not from grief but from forgetting why I was supposed to keep breathing without you reminding me.

This isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. I have a terminal case of you. No cure. Treatment is marriage—not because it'll fix anything, but because I want witnesses. I want documentation. I want someone to notarize this disaster so when I'm gone, there's evidence that once, impossibly, Leyi loved me back.

The ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's warm from my body heat. Sometimes I think it's developing a pulse. Say yes. Not for love—love is just neurons firing, chemicals swimming. Say yes for the stranger reason: because we've already started. Because stopping now would be like halting mid-sentence, mid-breath, mid-

Warren

P.S. I know you're reading this out loud in that whisper-voice you use for sacred things. I know your hands are shaking. Mine were too. Still are. Will be, probably, until you answer. Come find me. I'll be in the garage still, sitting on the concrete, waiting to find out if I get to keep living or just survive.
