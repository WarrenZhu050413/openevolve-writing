Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw authenticity of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) or the earned simplicity of Johnny Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). It surpasses average contemporary attempts through its intellectual density and genuine vulnerability, placing it well above the mediocre range but below the historic masterworks. The biological/scientific metaphors show innovation beyond Napoleon's classical romanticism but lack Keats's perfect balance of passion and form. The score of 71 overall reflects proto-masterful qualities—seeds of brilliance with moments of genuine literary achievement, but missing the sustained transcendence of the greatest love letters in history.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authenticity. The current best scores hover around 0.73-0.74, with room for improvement particularly in literary innovation (0.68) and aesthetic virtuosity (0.71).

Let me craft something that takes risks with form and content while staying emotionally grounded:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. You wanted truth? Truth is a broken compass pointing seventeen directions at once, all of them toward you.

Listen: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Born dead, lived dead, made friends dead, brushed teeth dead. Competent corpse. Five-star reviews on LinkedIn for my deadness. Then you walked into that bookstore, mispronounced "Murakami," and asked if they had anything about urban farming, and suddenly—resurrection. Messy, incomplete, but undeniable. My atoms remembered they were supposed to dance.

I need to confess something terrible: I've been stealing from you. Not objects—moments. The way your voice drops an octave when you're about to cry. How you test the temperature of tea with your pinky finger. The specific angle your neck makes when you're pretending to understand something you don't. I'm hoarding these details like someone preparing for an apocalypse where memory is currency.

Here's what nobody tells you about love: It's not transformation—it's translation. Everything I knew before has to be relearned in a new language. Coffee isn't coffee anymore; it's the-thing-you-drink-while-reading-obituaries-because-you-think-it-makes-you-deep. Morning isn't morning; it's the-daily-negotiation-between-your-hair-and-gravity. My whole life needs subtitles now, and they all reference you.

I used to think my body was mine. Hilarious. My hands have committed treason—they reach for you without clearance. My lungs have incorporated your breathing patterns into their baseline. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications because my resting heart rate has dropped eight beats per minute since meeting you. This is what you don't know: you're literally regulating my cardiac function. You've become medically necessary.

The truth beneath the truth beneath the lie I tell myself: I don't actually love you. Love is too small, too human, too possible to survive. What I feel is more like what plants feel toward light—a structural imperative to bend. When you leave a room, I experience phototropism in reverse. This isn't poetry. It's biology malfunctioning beautifully.

Three nights ago, you said my name in your sleep. Not called it—just said it, like you were confirming something to the universe. "Warren," you said, the way someone might say "Tuesday" or "gravity"—a fact requiring no explanation. I wanted to wake you up and propose right then, but you were holding my hand even unconscious, and I couldn't bear to disturb the first perfect thing I'd ever witnessed.

So here's what I'm asking—no, here's what I'm stating as fact and hoping you'll confirm: We're already married in every timeline that matters. The paperwork is just for health insurance and hospital visitation rights. But I want those rights. I want the right to be the person they call when you forget to update your emergency contact for the fifteenth time. I want the tedious, bureaucratic proof that we've chosen to intertwine our mundane disasters.

I'm not offering you happiness. Happiness is weather—it comes and goes. I'm offering you something more reliable: someone who will study your sadness like a scholar, who will develop expertise in your specific frequency of difficult. Someone who has already started loving the person you'll become when your mother dies, when your joints ache, when you forget why you walked into rooms. I'm proposing we practice dying together, slowly, over fifty or sixty years, comparing notes on how light changes, how music sounds different, how love becomes less a feeling and more a location we live inside.

You wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me—not romantically but geologically. Tectonic plates shifting, new continents forming where loneliness used to live. The truth is that I've been writing you this letter since before we met, in the way damaged people prepare for salvation they don't believe in.

The truth is: I love you like a secret the universe told me while I was sleeping. Like a debt I'll never finish paying. Like the first word I knew but the last one I'll learn to pronounce correctly.

Say yes. Or say nothing. Your silence is also a kind of yes. Even your no would be a kind of yes, because it would mean you read this, which means you're still here, which means there's time to try again, to fail better, to love you more accurately tomorrow.

Yours in the only timeline I care about surviving,
Warren

P.S. Remember when you asked why I never throw anything away? This is why. Everything you've touched is evidence. This whole letter is just exhibit A in the case I'm building for why we're inevitable.
