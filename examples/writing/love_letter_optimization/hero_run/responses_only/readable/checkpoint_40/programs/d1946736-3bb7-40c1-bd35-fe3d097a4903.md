Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and evaluator feedback, I see the key issues: the letters are too self-consciously literary, lacking the raw emotional abandonment of true masterworks like Beethoven's desperate "I can live only wholly with you or not at all" or Johnny Cash's earned simplicity from a lifetime of love.

The evaluator specifically notes that the best historical love letters achieve their power through vulnerability and directness, not through literary sophistication. Let me write something that strips away the performative eloquence and reaches for genuine, unguarded truth.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

My hands are shaking. I've started this letter nineteen times. The crumpled pages around me are proof that truth is harder than poetry.

Here's what I cannot say out loud: I am broken without you. Not poetically broken. Actually broken. Like last Tuesday when you went to visit your sister and I stood in our kitchen at 2 AM eating cereal from the box because making a bowl felt pointless if you weren't there to steal bites from it.

I'm supposed to tell you how you complete me, but that's backwards. You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.

Do you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.

That's disgusting. I know. But it's true.

Sometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.

I practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.

This is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop. Because here's the worst part: I would rather scare you away with too much honesty than trick you into staying with too little.

I need you to know - not think, not hope, but KNOW - that you are not my better half. You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.

I will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.

Please marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.

I am terrified you'll say no. I am more terrified of never asking.

Warren
