Summary:
Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I can see the key issues to address:

1. The current letter is too controlled and self-aware of its own literariness
2. It lacks the raw emotional desperation of masterworks like Beethoven's letters
3. It needs more earned simplicity and directness rather than intellectual sophistication
4. The letter should achieve abandonment and vulnerability, not eloquence

Let me create a more raw, desperate, and emotionally naked version:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I can't sleep. It's 4:17 AM and I'm shaking. Not from cold—from the terrible weight of what I need to tell you.

I'm not good at this. Words feel like lies compared to what happens in my chest when you walk into a room. But you asked for truth, so here: I am drowning in you. I wake up drowning. I go to sleep drowning. And the terrifying thing is—I don't want to be saved.

Do you know what you've done to me? Before you, I had a life. Plans. A sense of who I was. Now I'm just this raw, exposed nerve that only stops hurting when you're near. I tried to explain this to my friend last week and ended up crying in a parking lot because I couldn't make him understand that you're not just someone I love—you're the only reason I make sense anymore.

I watch you do ordinary things—brush your teeth, fold laundry, frown at your phone—and I feel like I'm witnessing something holy. Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder during that movie and I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb. I would have sat there forever. I would have let my arm fall off rather than wake you.

This is insane. I know it's insane. A grown man shouldn't feel like he's dying when someone doesn't text back. But that's what happens. You don't reply for an hour and I convince myself you've finally realized what everyone else knows—that I'm too much, too intense, too desperate for something I can't even name.

I love you in a way that frightens me. Not romantic-movie love. Not poetry love. This is uglier than that. This is me at 2 AM googling "how do you survive loving someone this much." This is crying in my car after dropping you off because I already miss you. This is checking your horoscope even though I don't believe in that stuff, just in case it tells me something about your day.

Sometimes I look at you and my hands literally shake because I want to tell you everything—every thought, every fear, every stupid hope—but I'm terrified it will be too much. That you'll see how completely you've hollowed me out and filled me with nothing but need for you, and you'll run.

But I can't keep pretending I'm okay with just dating. I'm not. I want your mornings. I want your bad moods. I want your 3 AM anxieties and your Sunday laziness. I want to fight with you about stupid things and make up and fight again. I want to grow old and weird with you. I want to be the person you call when the world breaks. I want to be in your emergency contacts. I want to matter to you the way you matter to me—which is to say: entirely.

Please. I'm begging you. Not with dignity or eloquence but with everything broken and desperate in me: marry me. Not because I deserve you—I don't. Not because I'll make you happy every day—I won't. But because I will love you with a faithfulness that borders on mental illness. Because you've ruined me for any life where you're not there. Because I would rather have one difficult day with you than a thousand easy days without you.

I'm sorry this isn't prettier. I'm sorry I'm not better at this. But this is what truth looks like at 4 AM when you've asked for honesty from someone who would rather die than disappoint you: I need you like I need air. And I'm terrified. And I'm yours. Completely.

Please say yes.

Warren
