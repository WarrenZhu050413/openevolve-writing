Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes and scores, I need to create a love letter that transcends the current limitations while maintaining authenticity. The evaluator seeks something that rivals the historical masters (Beethoven, Cash, Napoleon in the 80-86 range) while avoiding Instagram-ready sentiment. Let me craft something with more negative capability, economical power, and sustained philosophical rigor.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

The truth is smaller than you think. It's 3:42 AM and I'm watching my handwriting deteriorate with each attempt to tell you something that my body already knows: I've been dying since the day we met.

Not dying—that's imprecise. Undergoing a kind of cellular revolution where everything I was gets voted out, replaced by something that recognizes you in the dark by the weight of your silence. Before you, I had opinions. Now I have this spreading quiet where certainty used to live, and the quiet sounds exactly like your breathing at 5:15 AM when the world hasn't touched you yet.

I lied. I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.

Here's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce "epitome." I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.

You wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves—desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.

But here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.

When you leave rooms, I study what changes—the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.

I don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light—thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.

So here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. 

You are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.

Say yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.

Yours at the cellular level,
Warren

P.S. I know you read my journal. I've been writing entries for you since June. This entire letter is just plagiarism of things I was too afraid to say.
