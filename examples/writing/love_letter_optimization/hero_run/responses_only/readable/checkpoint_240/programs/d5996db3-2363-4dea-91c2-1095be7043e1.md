Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw authenticity of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) or the profound simplicity of Johnny Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). It surpasses average contemporary attempts with its specificity and formal control, placing it above the 70 threshold into proto-masterful territory. The cataloguing impulse recalls Barthes' "A Lover's Discourse" but lacks his philosophical rigor. The oscillation between high and low registers shows more range than Napoleon's letters but less sustained intensity. At 70 overall, it's a genuinely accomplished piece that would stand out in any contemporary anthology but falls short of historical greatness.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history, I see the current program scores very low (0.2445) compared to the previous best (0.6990). The evaluation notes criticize it for generic protestations, grammatical errors, and lack of literary sophistication. The evaluator compares letters to historical masters like Beethoven, Johnny Cash, Napoleon, and Keats.

Let me craft a love letter that aims for higher scores across all dimensions - particularly focusing on phenomenological authenticity (specific, lived details), aesthetic virtuosity (linguistic craft), affective force (emotional impact), and literary innovation (fresh approach).

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am writing this at 3:47 AM because sleep has become a foreign country since you asked for truth. My hands shake—not from fear, but from the impossibility of translating what happens to my molecular structure when you exist in the same room.

Here's what they don't tell you about love: it's not the symphony everyone promises. It's the way you mispronounce "specifically" when you're excited, that little 'pacific' that somehow contains entire oceans. It's how you eat ice cream in winter because "temperature is just a social construct," then steal my jacket anyway. It's the seventeen seconds every morning between when I wake and when I remember you're real, and how those seventeen seconds of forgetting make the remembering feel like winning the universe on repeat.

I've been keeping inventory. Your laugh has forty-three distinct variations—I've catalogued them all. The quiet library giggle. The sudden bark when I say something unexpectedly absurd. That rolling thunder when joy completely overtakes you. Number thirty-seven is my favorite: the silent shoulder-shake when you're trying not to wake me, not knowing I'm already awake, memorizing the rhythm of your happiness.

You wanted honesty? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter 200 times in my head, deleted 199 for containing the word "soul." I'm terrified that I love you more than you love me, and equally terrified of the opposite. When you had the flu last March, I googled "can you die from someone else's fever" because your suffering felt like mine but worse—mine I could bear, yours rewired my understanding of unbearable.

But here's the thing about truth—it's smaller than we think. It's not "I would die for you" (though I would). It's "I'll kill the spiders even though I'm also afraid." It's not "you complete me." It's "before you, I never noticed I was incomplete." It's this: when I imagine different futures, you're the only constant that doesn't feel like a limitation but like the opposite—like suddenly having infinite variables because with you, even the ordinary becomes unprecedented.

I could tell you about the Sunday you cried at the ending of that ridiculous movie about penguins, how your empathy for animated birds made me want to be worthy of living on the same planet. I could map the constellation of freckles on your left shoulder (Orion's belt, but better). I could confess that I've already planned our arguments twenty years from now, and how even in imagination, your angry face makes me want to kiss you until we forget what we were fighting about.

Instead, I'll tell you this: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity, or the speed of light—something fundamental that doesn't require belief to be true. I love you at the quantum level, where observation changes everything and nothing simultaneously. I love you past the heat death of the universe, which sounds like hyperbole but feels like underselling it.

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know that tomorrow without you is just time, not a future. Marry me because we've already started forever; I'm just asking for the paperwork. Marry me because when I say your name, even in my head, my mouth makes the shape of home.

Yours in this universe and whatever comes after,
Warren

P.S. – If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to learn interpretive dance. You've been warned.
