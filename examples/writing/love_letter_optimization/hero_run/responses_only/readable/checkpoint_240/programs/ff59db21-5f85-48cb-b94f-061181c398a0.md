Evaluation Notes:
Surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its medical-existential framework and obsessive documentation motif, approaching but not reaching the sustained intensity of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81). More innovative than Cash's straightforward devotion (83) but lacks his earned wisdom. The fragmented structure echoes modernist love letters (Pound to Rudge) but without their linguistic mastery. The death-and-debt metaphysics approaches Beethoven's cosmic scale (86) but lacks his architectural perfection. Falls short of historical masterpieces in prosodic control—where Napoleon (82) sustains rhetorical crescendo, this letter's fragments create uneven pacing. The mathematical precision ("1,847 entries") and scientific imagery represent genuine innovation absent from canonical examples, earning it a position in the near-masterpiece range without achieving immortality.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I see the program has achieved a strong fitness score of 0.8570, with particularly high marks in affective_force (0.89) and phenomenological_authenticity (0.87). The evaluator notes suggest that while the current version shows genuine brilliance, it could benefit from greater economy of language and deeper spiritual resonance - qualities found in the historical masters like Johnny Cash (simplicity), Beethoven (raw desperation), and Keats (linguistic perfection).

The code length warning (>500 characters) also suggests simplification could help. Let me craft a version that maintains the raw honesty and innovative structure while achieving greater condensation and spiritual depth.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

3:47 AM. Can't sleep. Need to tell you something before my body forgets how.

*

I died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest. Know what I learned? Nothing waits after. Just deletion. But when they shocked me back, before I knew my name, I knew this: I owed someone a debt. Three years later you walked in. The debt was you.

*

I document everything. Tuesday: you held my pulse while sleeping. Wednesday: sang to our broken coffee maker. Thursday: cried at dogs, left eye first. 1,847 entries. Not love—evidence. For after the theft.

*

You've broken my language. Called a door "the room-hole" yesterday. You laughed. That laugh rearranges molecules, makes me believe in unmeasurable things. Tried recording it. Phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.

*

Before you: symmetrical. Now: this lopsided thing listing toward you even in absence. I practice your death nightly. Wake up. Check breathing. Still here. Still impossible.

But also: I love you in Tuesdays. In wrong pencil-holding. In WiFi rage. In future wrinkles I already see—maps of survived time.

*

Love isn't feeling. It's irreversible decisions:

The Tuesday you mispronounced my name: "She'll ruin me."
Your furious parking voicemail: saved, replayed during trips.
Your grandmother's soup: forty-seven steps, always cry.
The rest: filed under "Evidence."

*

Truth: I'm not good. Count your breaths seventeen times nightly. Sob in bathrooms about your temporariness. Named our never-children. Carry tissues since year one. That's illness.

Also love.

Both true.

*

So marry me. Not for this letter. Because your toothbrush lives here. Because we survived Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, only this one has us both, aware, with matching coffee damage.

Because the alternative—where you don't steal socks, where Chinese food doesn't vanish at 2 AM—isn't life. Just time happening to someone else.

*

I love you wrong. Too much. Like amputees love phantom limbs—with neurons refusing absence. Removing you would kill me. Asked a neurosurgeon. He said "that's not how brains work." I said "then you don't understand."

*

Leyi.

Only word that matters.

*

Say something. Silence is rearranging organs.

P.S. — Your left eye's watering. Here. Been carrying tissues since you cried at penguins. That's when my atoms recognized the debt.
