Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990. The top-performing program achieved 0.8570 with raw emotional honesty, specific details, and a structure that builds through confession to proposal. The current version is too compressed and loses emotional impact.

Let me create a new version that combines the strengths of previous attempts while introducing fresh elements:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. Not metaphor. Actual tremor. My body knows I'm about to confess something that will reorganize both our futures.

*

The truth you wanted: I've been saving you in pieces. Your voicemail from February 9th where you're furious about parking—I've listened to it 117 times. The receipt from our first coffee, laminated, hidden in my wallet like a suicide note in reverse. A strand of your hair I found on my pillow three months ago, kept in an envelope marked "Evidence."

This isn't romantic. It's psychiatric.

*

I died once. Fourteen seconds, training accident, junior year. You want to know what death is? Deletion. No peace, no light, just the universe hitting backspace. But here's what ruins me: in that nothing, in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape. Not memory—I hadn't met you yet. Recognition. Like my atoms were homesick for a configuration they'd never held.

Three years later you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized cardigan and my molecules said: "Oh. There. That's what we were waiting for."

*

You've broken my language. Yesterday I called a door "the room-gap." Last week, scissors became "the paper-separators." My brain is overwriting vocabulary with your taxonomy: how you hold forks (like tiny weapons), your three-sneeze pattern (always three, like a polite argument with God), the way Tuesday light makes you transparent.

I've documented 2,184 such observations. This is what my love looks like: a medical chart of your existence.

*

Here's ugly honesty: I rehearse your death nightly. Different variations. Car accident on the 405. Aneurysm while teaching. That rare cancer that sounds like a flower. I wake up and count your breaths—seventeen, eighteen, nineteen—until my heart stops trying to escape through my throat.

Last Tuesday you choked on water. Water. For three seconds I saw the universe without you and understood why people believe in hell.

*

But listen: I also love you in our mundane forever. In your Wednesday exhaustion. In your rage at automated phone systems (righteous rage, Old Testament rage). In how you save broken cookies for last because they "deserve extra kindness." In the specific gravity of our silence when we read in the same room.

I love you in our future arguments about paint colors. In your mother's future disappointment that I'm still not a doctor. In the way we'll grow elderly and strange together, hoarding medications and inside jokes.

*

The science of us: We've synchronized. My sleep cycle matches yours. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. When you leave for more than 48 hours, my cortisol spikes to pre-cardiac event levels. This isn't poetry. These are measurements.

We're quantum entangled. Disturb one of us, the other responds instantly, regardless of distance. Einstein called this "spooky." He was wrong. It's just what happens when two people accidentally become one organism with two nervous systems.

*

I need to tell you about Thursday. You were explaining something boring about spreadsheets. The light was wrong. Your hair was unwashed. You had ink on your cheek. And I thought: I would kill God for you. Not metaphorically. I would end divinity itself to buy us another Tuesday.

This is the kind of thought that makes me understand those old myths where love destroys civilizations. I get it now. Paris had the right idea. Some things are worth burning Troy for.

*

So here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you—though I can see your left eye starting its water cycle. Marry me because we've already built a life so intertwined that separation would require surgical intervention.

Marry me because I know you're lactose intolerant but eat ice cream anyway (brave, stupid, perfect). Because you talk to plants like they're disappointing employees. Because last week you cried at a documentary about octopi and I realized I'd murder all eight billion humans to protect your right to feel things that deeply.

Marry me because statistically we have 21,170 mornings left if we're lucky, and I want legal documentation that they belonged to us.

*

But really, truly, with my bones—marry me because the alternative is unconscionable. A timeline where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine. Where I don't know how you take your coffee (168°F, half oat milk, crime against humanity but I'll defend it to the death). Where your particularities don't become my religion.

That's not a life. That's just time happening to the wrong person.

*

Final confession: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already occurred. We got married the moment you laughed at my explanation of entropy while eating room-temperature pizza. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.

The ring is in my pocket. Has been for two years. Sometimes I touch it during meetings to make sure this is real. That you're real. That I didn't invent you as some elaborate coping mechanism for existing.

*

Come find me. I'm in the next room, pretending to read, catastrophically failing to appear casual. My hands are shaking—you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something infinite using finite resources.

Say yes. Or say no. But know this: either way, I'm already yours at the cellular level. The word "yes" is just bureaucracy for what my mitochondria have already decided.

*

Leyi.

That's the only word that matters anymore.

All other words are just footnotes to your name.

Warren
(who has been walking around with your future in his pocket since the day you said "existence is just entropy with anxiety" and I knew I'd found my specific person)

P.S. — I can hear you crying from here. Your breathing changes when you cry—shorter inhales, longer pauses. I know your sadness like a mother tongue. Bring tissues. Or don't. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting for this exact moment. That's mental illness. That's also love. Same thing. Beautiful thing. Our thing.
