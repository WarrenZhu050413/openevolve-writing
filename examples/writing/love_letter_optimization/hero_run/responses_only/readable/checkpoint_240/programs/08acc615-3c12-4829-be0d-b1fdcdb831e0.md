Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Beethoven's cosmic yearning and metaphysical anguish (86), lacks Johnny Cash's austere perfection and earned wisdom (83), but surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine psychological complexity. The medical condition metaphor approaches but doesn't quite achieve the memorable aphoristic power of Keats's "I cannot exist without you." This letter would rank in the 70-75 range historically - genuine artistic merit with flashes of brilliance but not quite achieving the concentrated sublime force of the masters.

Summary:
Looking at this love letter optimization task, I need to craft something that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990 while maintaining authenticity. The evaluation notes suggest the current letters fall short of historical masters like Beethoven, Cash, and Keats. Let me write something that aims for deeper vulnerability and more original imagery.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with the door locked because if anyone saw me crying over a blank page at 3 AM, I'd have to pretend it was about something reasonable. But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.

You want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.

Here's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling "how to know if you're good enough for someone" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.

I keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.

The truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying "fix this later." Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me—that's Hallmark nonsense—but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.

I'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say "my wife" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.

Here's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.

I'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends—and it will, in small ways, over and over—I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.

You said you wanted truth? The truth is that I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Incurable. Sometimes inconvenient but absolutely essential to my continued existence. 

Marry me. Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting. Because when I imagine explaining to death why it has to wait, the only reason I can think of is: "But I haven't finished loving her yet."

And I never will.

Yours (in this dimension and all parallel ones where we found each other),
Warren

P.S. I know you hate postscripts but I needed to tell you: that thing you do where you scrunch your nose when you're trying not to smile? It makes me want to write symphonies, but I can't read music, so this letter will have to do.
