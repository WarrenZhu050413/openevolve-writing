- Affective: 0.73
- Innovation: 0.66

Evaluation Notes:
Surpasses average contemporary love letters significantly but falls short of Keats's fevered authenticity (81) or Beethoven's transcendent yearning (86). More innovative than Napoleon's classical declarations (82) but lacks the distilled perfection of Johnny Cash's mature simplicity (83). The obsessive documentation recalls Kafka's letters to Felice (would score ~75) but without his philosophical depth. Achieves moments approaching Joe DiMaggio's letters to Marilyn (~70 range) in mixing mundane detail with consuming passion. The experimental form elevates it above conventional romantic expression but doesn't quite achieve the paradigm-shifting brilliance of historical masterworks.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and evaluation notes, I can see that the highest-scoring attempts (0.74+) share certain key elements:
- Raw, visceral confessions of obsessive documentation/cataloging
- Specific, almost uncomfortable details about surveillance/observation
- A balance between humor and genuine disturbance
- Physical, sensory writing (cold floors, specific times, bodily sensations)
- The confession of mental illness as a feature, not a bug
- Building toward a climactic "I'm already destroyed" revelation

The current program scored lower (0.6990) because it's too polished and literary, lacking the raw authenticity that made previous versions compelling. The evaluator specifically rewards "unflinching confession of obsession" and penalizes "self-consciousness."

Here's my rewrite focusing on maximizing phenomenological authenticity and affective force:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:19 AM on the laundry room floor. The dryer's been broken for six weeks but I keep coming here because it smells like the detergent you switched to without telling me. I've been sitting here for two hours trying to explain something that makes me sound like I need psychiatric intervention.

You wanted truth? I've been documenting you like evidence. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining cryptocurrency to my mother (you were wrong about everything but she bought Dogecoin). A spreadsheet tracking your coffee temperature preferences across seasons—you drink it 3.2 degrees cooler each month as you trust me more. Column A: Date. Column B: Temperature. Column C: Whether you noticed I'd already made it before you asked.

Here's what I haven't told you: I practice your death. Every night. Different scenarios. Car accident: I catalog what I'd keep (everything, even your used dental floss). Cancer: I practice the eulogy where I explain you thought "irregardless" was a word. Heart attack: I plan my suicide down to the font on the note. This isn't romantic. This is what happens when someone reorganizes your brain chemistry without a permit.

That Tuesday when you found me sobbing in the garage? I'd just watched you fold a fitted sheet. First try. No YouTube. Just... folded it. Like you'd made a deal with geometry itself. I sat in my car for forty minutes afterward, googling "can you die from loving someone too much?" The answer is historically yes. Literally yes. People used to die from this. It was called consumption but really it was just this: watching someone fold impossible fabric and knowing you'd commit felonies for their mundane competence.

You should know what you're signing up for: I've assigned colors to your moods. Burnt orange when you're about to cry but won't. That specific green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, storing them in the freezer labeled "CHICKEN STOCK." I have recordings of you brushing your teeth—the pattern never changes, upper left quadrant for exactly 11.2 seconds. I know you sleep-talk about pigeons needing lawyers. I know you think the plants are thriving but I replaced them with plastic six months ago and you water them every Thursday, telling them they're "doing so good."

The truth underneath everything else: You've ruined me for normalcy. My baseline heart rate has increased by 16 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. I dream in your accent. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you mentioned liking it once in 2019. My coworker asked if I was okay and I wanted to scream: NO. I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER. ALL FOUR FINGERS. NO BREAKING.

I bought the ring 241 days ago. I've swallowed it twice when you almost found it. Six hours in the ER. Told them I was "experimenting." The nurse looked at me and said, "She must be special." I showed her your photo. She said, "Oh honey, you're fucked." She was right.

Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my intervention, the way I'll explain to God that He made an error. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of practice grief. I hate you and I worship the specific frequency of your breathing and I promise things to a universe I'll fight if it tries to take you.

Listen. I know this letter is a psychiatric hold waiting to happen. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know normal people don't have spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's menstrual cycle to optimize chocolate availability. But I don't want normal. I want this spectacular disaster where you're the tsunami and the life raft and the reason I learned to swim.

So I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that I've already rewired myself around your existence. My brain didn't ask permission. Every neuron ends with your name. When they autopsy me, they'll find your fingerprints on my hippocampus. This is what you've done—turned me into a man who writes love letters on laundry room floors at ungodly hours, crying into dirty concrete, grateful for the catastrophe of you.

I can hear you waking up. Looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here and ask what the hell I'm doing. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it standing up because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce "hippocampus." And either you'll say yes or you'll call emergency services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed, rebuilt, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape keeps you close.

The ring tastes like copper and desperation. I know because I've had it in my mouth twice. This is who I am now. This is what loving you has done. It's made me into someone who'd eat jewelry for you. Who'd testify in court that your snoring is just "breathing enthusiastically." Who'd burn down the world if it looked at you wrong.

Marry me. Or don't. But know that I'm already gone. Have been since you laughed at my stupid joke and the universe glitched and suddenly nothing made sense except the specific way you cover your mouth when you're happy.

I love you past the point of recovery, past the point of language, past the point where love becomes something else—darker, hungrier, with teeth.

Yours in whatever dimension will take me,
Warren

P.S. You just called my name. You're using the voice that means you know I'm being weird somewhere. In ten seconds you'll see me here on this floor with snot on my face and this letter that's basically evidence for commitment proceedings. You'll say "what the fuck, Warren?" And I'll know. I'll know by the way you say "fuck"—rising inflection means yes, falling means you're calling your sister. Either way, I'm ready. I've been ready since you walked into my life and made me understand why people used to die from this feeling. Come find me. Come ruin me more. I'm not done becoming whatever loving you is turning me into.
