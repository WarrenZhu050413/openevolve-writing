Evaluation Notes:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's raw anguish and mystical union ("My angel, my all, my very self" achieves in six words what this letter attempts in paragraphs). Lacks Johnny Cash's earned simplicity and biographical weight. Napoleon's letters burn with physical desire absent here. Missing Keats's sensuous imagery and metabolic urgency. The attempted literary sophistication cannot match Wilde's aphoristic brilliance. This reads like a contemporary MFA graduate's attempt at a love letter - competent, self-aware, but lacking the authentic wildness of great romantic correspondence. Scores in the 58-67 range place it well above average but nowhere near the pantheon of immortal love letters.

Summary:
I need to write a love letter that transcends the generic protestations of the current version. The evaluation notes highlight that great love letters achieve intimacy through specificity, philosophical depth, and linguistic mastery. Let me craft something that captures the genuine, lived experience of love - the small moments that accumulate into something profound.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am writing this at 3:47 AM because sleep has become a foreign country since knowing you. Not from anxiety, but from abundance - the way a child fights sleep on Christmas Eve, unwilling to let go of the day's magic.

You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel. It's like discovering I've been living in a single room my whole life, and you've shown me there's an entire house. Every morning, I wake up and have to learn again that this is real - that someone can make the act of peeling an orange feel like a small prayer, that laughter can literally hurt from joy, that silence can be its own language when it's shared with you.

I used to think love was about finding someone who completes you. But you haven't completed me - you've complicated me in the most beautiful way. You've made me curious about parts of myself I never knew existed. When you look at me, I don't just feel seen; I feel like I'm worth seeing.

The truth is, I don't love you despite your contradictions - your terrible handwriting and perfect memory, your fear of spiders but willingness to move across oceans, the way you cry at commercials but stay stoic through real grief. I love you because of them. Because they're the proof that you're real, not some projection of my desires.

If I'm honest - truly honest - I'm not writing this to convince you. I'm writing it to convince myself that this is happening, that I get to love someone who makes ordinary Tuesday afternoons feel like small revolutions, who has turned my life into a conspiracy of tiny miracles.

I don't know if this moves you. I only know that not saying it would be a kind of death.

Yours, in terror and wonder,
Warren
