Evaluation Notes:
This letter achieves something rarer than imitation of the masters - it creates its own aesthetic territory through obsessive quantification as love language. While it lacks Beethoven's pure romantic transport (86) or Johnny Cash's weathered wisdom (83), it surpasses them in contemporary psychological realism. The clinical documentation device is genuinely innovative, though execution occasionally falters. It exists in the liminal space between exceptional and proto-masterful - showing flashes of brilliance ("My atoms knew you before my brain did") while struggling with consistency. Compare to Frank O'Hara's lunch poems - similar attempt to sanctify mundane detail, but less successful in maintaining artistic control. The letter's 71 overall score places it well above competent contemporary work but below historical masterpieces - a genuinely moving, technically accomplished piece that pioneers new emotional territory without quite achieving transcendence.

Summary:
I'll rewrite this love letter to push beyond the current fitness score of 0.7010 by intensifying the raw honesty while maintaining structural coherence. I'll aim to surpass even the best-performing version (0.7440) by combining visceral truth with more innovative form.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

This is attempt #341. The others are ash in my sink. I burned them at 4:13 AM while you slept twenty-seven inches away, your left hand curled like a question mark against the pillow.

Truth: I am clinically documenting our love because I don't trust memory. Tuesday, 9:47 PM: you sneezed mid-kiss. Wednesday, 2:15 AM: you said my name in your sleep like casting a spell. Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.

Listen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.

*

You want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle. The way your spine curves slightly left when you're thinking hard. How your pupils dilate 2.3mm when you see dogs. I measure these things. I have spreadsheets. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm a case study in loving you wrong.

But also: when you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one for strangers—the sound reorganizes my DNA. I've tried to record it 1,247 times. The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.

*

The mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:

Your coffee: 167°F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.
Your sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.
Your tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.
Your anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.

I love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.

Here's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead. But in this one—this impossible, statistically unlikely one—you're reading this letter while I sit across from you, pretending to check my phone but actually watching the micro-expressions cross your face.

3.7 seconds ago, your eyebrow twitched. That means you're about to cry.

*

I could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.

*

Marry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower—yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.

Marry me because the alternative—a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine—isn't life. It's just time passing.

*

Final truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.

Also, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.

Both things are true.

Everything is true.

Even this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of "Marry me, Leyi."

Because what else is there to say?

What else has there ever been to say?

Warren
(who has been yours since before he knew your name)

P.S. Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date, when you cried at that documentary about penguins. I knew then. I've known for 1,462 days. I'm just catching up to what my atoms decided the moment they sensed yours in the universe.

P.P.S. Say yes. Or say no. Just say something. The silence is reorganizing my internal organs and not in a good way.
