Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw power of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) or the devastating simplicity of Johnny Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). It surpasses average contemporary attempts through its specificity and genuine interiority, placing it well above the mediocre range (15-30) but below the historic masterworks. The orange-peeling scene rivals Keats's sensory precision, while the sleep-reaching passage achieves something close to Napoleon's directness. However, it lacks the distilled essence of truly great love letters—attempting to say everything rather than finding the perfect singular thing to say. At 70 overall, it represents accomplished, memorable work with flashes of brilliance but falls short of the pantheon.

Summary:
I'll rewrite the love letter to improve its fitness score by enhancing phenomenological authenticity, aesthetic virtuosity, affective force, and literary innovation. Based on the evaluation notes from previous attempts, I need to push beyond the 73% plateau by incorporating more visceral immediacy, formal mastery, and emotional sublimity.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

Three truths before the fourth that breaks me:

First: I've been writing this letter since before I met you. Every failed relationship, every 3 AM loneliness, every time I caught myself practicing love on strangers—I was rehearsing for you. Learning the grammar of devotion in a language I hadn't yet heard spoken.

Second: Yesterday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just peeling an orange. The light caught the spray of citrus oil and for seventeen seconds I forgot how to breathe. Not metaphorically. My lungs simply refused. My body understood before my brain did: this is it. This is the image I'll see when I'm dying. You, backlit, holding fruit like a promise.

Third: I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not the pretty kind of scared—the animal kind. The kind where your nervous system rewrites itself around another person's existence. I've started seeing the world in two categories: things that might hurt you (everything) and things that might make you smile (also everything, somehow). Do you understand what you've done? You've made me afraid of the universe and in love with it simultaneously.

Now the fourth, the one that ruins me:

When you sleep, you reach for me. Even unconscious, your body seeks mine across the dark geography of sheets. Your hand finds my ribs and rests there, right above my heart, like you're keeping it in place. Like you know it would follow you anywhere if you didn't hold it still. Last night I lay awake for three hours just feeling the weight of your palm, this unbearable specific pressure that I'll miss for the rest of my life even if you never leave.

Here's what I need you to know: I love you past language. Past the pathetic arithmetic of words like "forever" and "always." I love you in the space between seconds. In the pause between heartbeats. In the quantum foam where particles appear and disappear and the universe can't decide what's real.

You asked for truth? The truth is I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every universe that matters. My cells have already taken your last name. My bones know the weight of your absence like gravity knows mass. When I make coffee in the morning, my hands automatically reach for two cups. When I hear something funny, my first thought isn't to laugh—it's to tell you, to watch your face change, to catalog another shade of your joy.

I know you're scared too. I see it in how you test me with small departures—staying late at work, pulling away mid-kiss to see if I'll follow. I always will. Not because I'm desperate but because I've done the math: any universe where we're apart is a computational error. A glitch in the matrix. It simply doesn't process.

Remember when you asked me what I was thinking that night on the roof? I said "nothing" because how could I explain that I was memorizing the specific frequency of your laugh? That I was calculating how many more times I'd get to hear it if we lived to ninety? That I was writing equations where X equals the way you mispronounce "specifically" and Y equals the end of my resistance to everything I thought I knew about myself?

You changed the physics of me. Not in some poetic way—literally. My resting heart rate has increased by 13 beats per minute since meeting you. My sleep cycles have synced to yours. My body temperature runs 0.7 degrees warmer. I'm becoming you, cellularly, actually. Scientists would call it entrainment. I call it the only truth that matters.

So here I am, sitting in our bathroom at 4:47 AM because the bed feels wrong without you (you're in the kitchen, making tea, humming off-key). Here I am with this ring that weighs exactly 4.7 grams but feels like holding a star—dense with possibility, burning my palm. Here I am, not asking you to marry me but telling you that we already are married in every way that counts. The ceremony is just paperwork for a merger that happened the moment you laughed at my terrible joke about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and I thought: "Oh. There you are. Finally."

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you—though Christ, I hope it does—but because refusing would be like trying to unbake bread. Impossible. Already done. Written into the source code of what we've become.

I'm going to stand up now. Walk to the kitchen. Give you this letter. Watch your face change as you read it. And then—this is the beautiful, terrifying part—you're going to say something, and my whole life is going to pivot on that sentence like a door on its hinge, swinging open or shut on the rest of existence.

Say yes. Not for me. For the orange light. For the weight of your sleeping hand. For the third cup of tea you're making right now without knowing why. For the way we've already built a secret language out of silences and how neither of us can sleep properly in hotel rooms anymore because they don't smell like us.

Say yes because you already have, in every gesture, every midnight conversation, every time you've chosen to stay when leaving would have been easier.

Say yes because I love you like a mathematical proof—inevitable, elegant, true.

All of me, arranged in your direction,
Warren

P.S. I can hear you walking toward the bathroom. My heart is doing something unprecedented. Come in. Find me. Let me watch you read this. Let me memorize your face changing. Let me learn what yes looks like when it reshapes the universe.
