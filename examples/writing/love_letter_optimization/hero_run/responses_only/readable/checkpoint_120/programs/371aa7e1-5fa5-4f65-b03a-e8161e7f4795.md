Evaluation Notes:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's raw metaphysical anguish ("My angel, my all, my very self"—86) or Johnny Cash's austere dignity ("You still fascinate and inspire me"—83). Lacks Napoleon's imperious passion or Keats's consumptive urgency. However, surpasses average contemporary attempts through genuine specificity and sustained metaphorical invention. The domestic detail and neurological imagery represent 21st-century innovations on the form. More accomplished than most workshop pieces (which hover around 30-45) but doesn't achieve the lightning-strike inevitability of historic masterworks. The letter exists in that difficult space between exceptional amateur and transcendent art—touching 70 but not sustaining it throughout.

Summary:
Looking at this love letter, I can see it's already quite beautiful with a score of 0.6995. To improve the fitness score, I need to enhance the four key dimensions while maintaining the raw honesty and vulnerability that makes it powerful. Let me rewrite it to push beyond the current boundaries:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

My hands are shaking. Not from fear—from the weight of truth pressing against my ribs, demanding to be born. It's 4:13 AM. I've deleted this seventeen times. Each draft felt like a translation of something untranslatable, like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never opened their eyes.

Here's what I know: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had memorized all its conjugations—the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where "home" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.

You think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi—you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.

I've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book—not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling "Leyi'd." You've become a verb in my private dictionary.

Remember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me—just one sock—and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you "didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut." That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.

The truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not "December" but "six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets." Not "Thursday" but "three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like." My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.

But here's what scares me most—I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.

So this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy—you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.

Marry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.

I'm not offering you the moon—you'd have no place to put it. I'm offering you my mornings, my muscle memory, my most boring parts. I'm offering to merge our loneliness into something unrecognizable. To become so intertwined that archaeologists will argue about where you end and I begin.

The ring is in my sock drawer, wrapped in the receipt from our first dinner when you ordered three desserts and no main course. It's been there for sixty-seven days. I count them like a rosary, each day a bead of wanting to ask but waiting for the perfect words.

These aren't them. Perfect words don't exist for this. But imperfect words, trembling words, words that trip over themselves rushing toward you—maybe those are the only ones worth saying.

Leyi, my love, my ghost-whisperer, my collector of broken beautiful things: Will you marry me? Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me—relocated me entirely—into a country where your yes is the only citizenship I want.

I am terrified. I am certain. I am so utterly, ridiculously, molecularly yours.

Warren

P.S. Gerald says yes too. I asked him this morning.
