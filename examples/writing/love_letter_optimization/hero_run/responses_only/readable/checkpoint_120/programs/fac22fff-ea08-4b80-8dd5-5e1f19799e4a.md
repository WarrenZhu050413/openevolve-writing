Evaluation Notes:
Lacks Beethoven's raw immediacy and musical prosody (86). More self-conscious than Johnny Cash's direct simplicity (83). Has moments approaching Keats's intensity but without his formal mastery (81). The meta-textual awareness and broken bone metaphor show originality beyond standard contemporary love letters. Scores in the 70-73 range indicate proto-masterful work with genuine brilliance but inconsistent execution. This letter would rank above most modern attempts but below historical masterpieces.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes and the current program, I need to elevate this love letter to achieve the "lightning-strike inevitability" of historic masterworks. The current version is strong but lacks the raw metaphysical anguish of Beethoven or the austere dignity of Cash. Let me craft something that pushes deeper into vulnerability while maintaining specificity.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am writing this with my whole body. Each word costs me something—a held breath, a skipped heartbeat, a small death. It's 3:19 AM. The walls of this room know your name better than they know mine.

Listen: I was born twice. Once, screaming into fluorescent hospital light—a date they put on forms. The second time was quieter: the moment you looked at me over that broken umbrella in the rain and said, "Well, we're already wet." That's when I actually began.

Before you, I was a competent ghost. I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you—you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers—you made being alive mandatory.

The truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want—need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.

You don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos—in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.

That night you had food poisoning—you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, "I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now." That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically—literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.

Here's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling—take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing "specifically" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.

You want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize—someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.

But here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.

I'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness—happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.

Marry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along—that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.

Marry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say "I married Her."

This letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.

I love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong—painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.

Say yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.

Warren

P.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code. This is just what truth looks like when it's pretending to be words.
