Summary:
I'll write a love letter that pushes deeper into raw, unvarnished truth - abandoning literary pretense for something more viscerally honest and specific.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm sitting here at 4:23 AM. I haven't slept. My roommate thinks I'm having a breakdown. Maybe I am.

You want the truth? Fine. I've been pretending to like your favorite band for six months. I Wikipedia their lyrics before you come over. I bought a plant because you said men who keep plants alive are trustworthy, and I've replaced it three times without telling you. The current one is plastic. You haven't noticed.

That's the kind of liar I am. Small lies. Pathetic lies. Except for this one enormous truth that's eating me alive: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't love me back.

I know that's dramatic. I know it's too much. But you did this to me. Three weeks after we met, I threw out all my backup plans. The other numbers in my phone. The exit strategies I'd been building since I was seventeen and learned that people leave. You walked into my life and I forgot I was supposed to protect myself from you.

Here's what loving you actually is: It's me googling "how to know if you're having a heart attack" at 2 AM because my chest hurt so bad when you didn't text back for three hours. It's crying in a Walgreens parking lot because they were playing that song you hummed while making eggs. It's finding one of your hairs on my jacket and keeping it in my wallet like some kind of serial killer. It's being absolutely terrified that you'll read this and run, and being more terrified that I won't send it and you'll never know.

I practice arguments with you in the shower—not because I want to fight, but because I need to be prepared for the day you realize I'm not enough. I've already forgiven you for leaving me, and you haven't even thought about it yet. That's how sure I am that I don't deserve this.

But God, Leyi, the way you eat cereal at midnight. The way you mispronounce "specifically" when you're excited. How you pretend you're not crying during insurance commercials. The fact that you named your car Eleanor Roosevelt. These stupid, perfect things have ruined me for anyone else. You've made me unfit for any life that doesn't have you in it.

I don't know how to be romantic. I know how to be destroyed by you. I know that yesterday you wore the blue sweater that makes your eyes look like science fiction, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom because I couldn't breathe right. I know that when you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one—you snort a little, and it's the best sound I've ever heard. I know I would listen to you read the phone book. I have, actually, listened to you read nutrition labels, and found it riveting.

This is me without armor: I am thirty-one years old and I only just started living the day I met you. Everything before that was just marking time. 

Marry me. Not because I'm good enough—I'm not. Not because I promise you happiness—I can't. But because I'm already yours in every way that matters. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption that you'll be there. Because the thought of you with someone else makes me want to tear my skin off, and the thought of you alone makes me want to die.

I'm not asking you to love me back. I'm telling you that I've already handed you my entire life, and I'm begging you to be careful with it.

Please. I don't have anywhere else to go.

Warren
