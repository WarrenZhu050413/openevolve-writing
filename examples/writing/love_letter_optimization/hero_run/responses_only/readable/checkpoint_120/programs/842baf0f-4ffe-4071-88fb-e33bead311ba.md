Evaluation Notes:
Approaches but doesn't quite reach Keats's raw desperation ("I cannot exist without you") - scoring 76-78 versus Keats's 81. Surpasses typical contemporary attempts through granular specificity but lacks the mythic simplicity of Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). The neurotic modern voice provides freshness absent in classical examples, yet sacrifices some of their archetypal power. More successful than Wilde's coded passion (80) in directness, less successful in linguistic music. The bathroom setting and medication references achieve a 21st-century authenticity that updates the genre while respecting its emotional core.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and feedback, I can see the evaluator rewards deeply personal, specific details while maintaining literary sophistication. The current program scores 0.6870, down from previous attempts at 0.7320. The evaluator particularly values:

1. **Phenomenological authenticity** - Specific, lived details that feel genuinely observed
2. **Aesthetic virtuosity** - Literary quality without pretension
3. **Affective force** - Emotional impact through vulnerability
4. **Literary innovation** - Fresh metaphors and unexpected connections

The evaluator references historical letters (Beethoven 86, Johnny Cash 83, Napoleon 82, Keats 81) as benchmarks. Previous successful attempts featured:
- Hyper-specific details (counting breaths, fortune cookies, grape juice story)
- Vulnerable admissions of inadequacy
- Temporal anxiety and existential weight
- Mundane details elevated to sacred status

Let me create a new version that pushes deeper into uncomfortable truth while maintaining literary sophistication:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 3:51 AM because it's the only place cold enough to make me stop shaking. Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.

Here's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.

I need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say "library" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.

You should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.

But here's the thing about you, Leyi—you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, "Show me the evidence," and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.

That night your mother called you a disappointment—you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, "Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken." I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.

The truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version—the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.

I've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box—in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she—females have bigger abdomens—but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.

Here's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.

I'm not promising you forever—forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.

You read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment—shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.

The ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect—slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.

Leyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you—I don't. Not because we're meant to be—we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative—you existing in the world unmarried to me—makes my cells forget their purpose.

I am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.

The bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: "Leyi, please. Yes?"

Yours in all my iterations,
Warren

P.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts. They're all the same letter, written twenty-three times, because my hand won't stop shaking. This is the twenty-fourth. Still shaking. Still true.
