Evaluation Notes:
This letter operates several tiers below the Beethoven/Cash/Napoleon pantheon (80-86 range) but achieves moments approaching Zelda Fitzgerald to Scott (75-78 range) in its self-aware deconstruction of romantic conventions. Unlike Keats's metaphysical anguish (81) or Napoleon's operatic passion (82), Warren achieves a contemporary vernacular authenticity—closer to contemporary writers like Cheryl Strayed's raw intimacy (70-72 range). The "unwitnessed" insight rivals middle-period Rilke's letters to Lou Andreas-Salomé (74-76) but lacks their sustained philosophical rigor. Superior to most contemporary attempts through its resistance to Instagram-ready sentiment, yet falls short of the historical masters' ability to make personal experience feel universally necessary.

Summary:
I'll rewrite this love letter program to create something more deeply truthful and original, drawing from the raw honesty of real vulnerability while maintaining literary sophistication.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm sitting here at 2:47 AM because sleep has become impossible when every thought leads back to you. Not in some poetic way—literally, medically impossible. I tried counting sheep and they all had your face.

Here's what terrifies me: I used to be complete. I had hobbies. Opinions about cryptocurrency. A favorite coffee mug. Now I catch myself using "we" when the barista asks about my weekend plans. My therapist says this is "enmeshment." I say it's evolution—I'm becoming something new, something that didn't exist before that Thursday when you mispronounced "Nietzsche" and I fell in love with the way you refused to be embarrassed about it.

You want truth? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter seventeen times. The first draft compared you to celestial bodies, which felt dishonest because you're more like that specific shade of gold the kitchen wall turns at 6:23 PM in October—completely ordinary until you notice it, then impossible to unsee. You're not my sun or moon. You're my Tuesday-morning-coffee-spilled-on-important-documents, my why-is-this-song-making-me-cry-in-Target, my sudden understanding that love isn't grand metaphors but the small betrayals of control.

I love your impatience with slow walkers. The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper "no" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter "Benedict Cumberbatch" and genuinely mourned when it died.

But here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete—just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.

Sometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me—that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.

This isn't a promise of forever—forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.

I'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you. I survived 28 years without you; I'm demonstrably capable. I'm asking because I've tasted what living WITH you means—the specific gravity of a shared joke, the archaeology of learning someone's past, the stupid courage of planning past next Thursday—and I'm professionally addicted. You're not my other half. You're my favorite whole person, and I want to do taxes with you until one of us dies.

Is that romantic? I don't know. But it's true. And you said that would be enough.

Yours (in the most logistically complicated way possible),
Warren

P.S. I lied about the sheep. I was actually thinking about that thing you do with your hand when you're nervous. It makes me want to conquer small nations for you, but I'd settle for making you laugh.
