Evaluation Notes:
Lacks Beethoven's raw urgency and mystical dimension; doesn't achieve Johnny Cash's economy of devastating simplicity; missing Napoleon's obsessive, almost frightening intensity; doesn't reach Keats's fusion of intellectual and sensual; falls short of Wilde's aesthetic brilliance. This letter occupies the space between accomplished contemporary literary fiction and true epistolary mastery—sophisticated and moving but not immortal. It would stand as one of the better love letters of 2024, but wouldn't survive anthologization alongside history's greatest. The writer has real talent but hasn't yet found the voice that transcends technique.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history, I can see the fitness declined from 0.6870 to 0.5145. The current program is too brief and lacks the specific, concrete details that made the higher-scoring versions successful. The best-performing letters (0.6995, 0.6970, 0.6870) all share certain qualities: specific sensory memories, vulnerable admissions of fear alongside certainty, unique metaphors, and a balance between the cosmic and the mundane.

Let me craft a new version that combines the strengths of the top performers while exploring a different emotional territory:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

My hands are shaking as I write this. Not from fear of rejection—from the weight of finally releasing what has been building inside me like water against a dam. You asked for truth. Here it is, unfiltered and probably inadequate.

I fell in love with you on a Wednesday. You were eating a peach over the kitchen sink, juice running down your wrist, completely unconscious of your own radiance. You laughed at the mess you were making, and I understood with sudden, devastating clarity that I would spend the rest of my life trying to deserve that unconscious joy. That was fourteen months ago. I've loved you for 427 days, and I'm only now brave enough to say it.

You should know what you're getting: I am not easy to love. I wake at 3 AM overthinking conversations from years ago. I alphabetize books but leave dishes in the sink. I'm terrified of heights but even more terrified of staying in one place. I cry at the ending of children's movies but stay stoic at funerals. I am a walking contradiction held together by anxiety and coffee.

But with you, these broken parts make sense. You laugh at my 3 AM panics and make me tea. You move my dishes to the washer without complaint. You hold my hand on bridges and let me plan our next adventure. You pause movies to let me compose myself. You don't try to fix me—you help me understand that I was never broken, just unassembled.

I love the way you mangle idioms when you're excited—"we'll burn that bridge when we get to it." I love that you name inanimate objects (the toaster is Gerald, the car is Beatrice). I love your rivalry with the neighbor's cat, how you narrow your eyes at each other through the window like old enemies. I love that you read the last page of books first because you can't bear suspense but still cry at endings you saw coming.

Most of all, I love who we are together. How we can sit in silence for hours, reading different books but breathing the same air. How you finish my sentences wrong but in ways that are better than what I planned to say. How we've developed our own language of looks across crowded rooms, entire conversations in eyebrow raises and half-smiles.

I'm not proposing a fairy tale. I'm proposing reality: morning breath and midnight fears, spectacular fights about nothing and quiet reconciliations over coffee, the slow accumulation of inside jokes and shared scars, growing old and weird and increasingly ourselves, together.

You once told me that love should feel like coming home. I need you to know: you aren't my home. You're my choice to leave every other home I've built, to be gloriously, permanently lost with you. You're my voluntary exile from every safer, smaller life I could have lived.

So here I am, anxiously sitting in this room that feels too small for everything I feel, offering you my terrified heart. Not because you complete me—that mythology insults us both. But because you inspire me to complete myself, to become someone worthy of the enormous privilege of loving you.

Marry me. Not for forever—I don't trust words that large. Marry me for now, for tomorrow, for all the small forevers we can string together like lights against the dark.

Yours, in truth and trembling,
Warren
