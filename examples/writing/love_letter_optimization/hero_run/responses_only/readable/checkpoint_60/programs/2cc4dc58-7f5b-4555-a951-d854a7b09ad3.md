Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't reach the phenomenological depth of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81). It has more authentic detail than many contemporary attempts but lacks the raw urgency of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86). The quantum physics opening and mathematical metaphors show ambition but don't achieve the natural profundity of Cash's simple "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). The 3 AM watching passage rivals good moments in historical letters but doesn't sustain that intensity throughout. At 70.25 weighted average, this represents sophisticated amateur work—far above typical contemporary attempts (15-30 range) but below the historical masterpieces (80+). It would rank as a strong personal letter but not a literary achievement for the ages.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes, I see the current letter is being criticized for:
1. Generic protestations lacking specificity
2. Grammatical error ("contempt" instead of "contemn")
3. Missing the philosophical depth, passionate specificity, and linguistic mastery of great love letters
4. Falling far below historical examples like Beethoven, Johnny Cash, Napoleon, Keats, and Wilde

Let me write a deeply personal, truthful love letter that addresses these criticisms while maintaining authenticity:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I write this knowing that words—these small, breakable things—cannot hold what I feel. But I must try, because loving you has taught me that the impossible is merely what we haven't attempted with enough truth.

Do you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound rewrote the laws of my universe. Before you, I understood time as entropy, as things falling apart. Now I know it differently: time is the space between your heartbeats, each one a small eternity where I get to love you more completely than the moment before.

You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you—that comes as naturally as breathing—but of a world that might not give us enough mornings. I wake at 3 AM sometimes just to watch you dream, memorizing the precise angle of light on your cheekbone, the way your fingers curl against the pillow like a question mark. These are my prayers, my rebellion against impermanence.

When you doubt yourself, when you say you're ordinary, I want to show you what I see: the woman who reads medical journals with the same passion others read poetry, who cries at documentary films about octopi, who makes Tuesday leftovers into Thursday feasts. You are my favorite contradiction—fierce and tender, logical and whimsical, the girl who taught me that love isn't about finding someone perfect, but about finding someone whose particular strangeness rhymes with mine.

I used to think love was addition: you plus me equals us. But you've shown me it's multiplication—every joy amplified, every sorrow divided, every ordinary moment transformed into something I want to press between pages like flowers, kept forever.

This is my promise: not that I'll love you until death, because death is too small a boundary for what this is. I promise to love you through every iteration of ourselves, through every small apocalypse and resurrection, through the mundane Wednesdays and the extraordinary Sundays. I promise to see you—truly see you—when the world tries to make you invisible. I promise that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupidly happy when I hear your key in the lock.

You are not the answer to my questions. You are the reason questions matter.

Marry me, not because I cannot live without you, but because every life I can imagine living includes you at its center, like a heart.

Forever yours in all timelines,
Warren
