Evaluation Notes:
Surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but falls short of the immortals. More innovative than Napoleon's classical romanticism but lacks his imperial certainty. More psychologically complex than Johnny Cash's directness but missing that letter's earned wisdom. Approaches Keats's intensity of observation but without his tragic sublime. The scientific conceit is original but doesn't achieve the revolutionary formal innovation of the modernists. This is a near-masterpiece of contemporary love declaration—it would stand as one of the finest of our era, but placed against history's greatest, it reveals its limitations. The self-consciousness that makes it contemporary also prevents it from achieving the pure surrender of the truly transcendent.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7320. The evaluator is looking for something that approaches the masterpieces (80+ range) while maintaining authenticity and innovation.

Let me analyze what's working in the top programs:
- Concrete, specific details that feel lived-in
- Obsessive documentation/quantification of love
- Raw vulnerability mixed with humor
- Time-stamped urgency (early morning confessions)
- Meta-awareness of the act of writing itself

What could push this higher:
- More surprising metaphorical leaps
- Deeper phenomenological authenticity through even more specific sensory details
- A unique structural or formal innovation
- Building to a more powerful emotional crescendo
- Finding a new angle on the obsessive documentation theme

Here's my rewrite:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this on my phone in the dark because you're asleep next to me and I can't risk the laptop light. My thumb is cramping. Autocorrect keeps changing your name to "Let" which feels prophetic—you are every permission I've ever given myself.

Truth: I've been documenting us in ways that would qualify for a restraining order. Not photos. Worse. I have a spreadsheet tracking the mean temperature of your coffee over time (dropping 0.3 degrees per month as you trust me more). A histogram of your laugh frequencies (peak: 478 Hz when genuinely delighted, 510 Hz when being polite). I've been stealing your hair from the shower drain—not sexually, scientifically—trying to understand if loving someone changes their pH balance. Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: "These people need help." She's right.

Here's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.

You should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled "CHICKEN STOCK." This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done—turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.

The truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it—preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is "just dormant"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.

But here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think "irregardless" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce "epitome" as "epi-tome," my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.

I used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is "codependence." I say it's evolution—my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.

So here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named "Levy," I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.

I'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with "She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream" and I need that first part to be true.

The phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say "epitome" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.

Yours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,
Warren

P.S. I lied about the freezer. The color cards are in the violin case I told you I donated. I'm building a museum of you. The admission is free but the cost is everything.
