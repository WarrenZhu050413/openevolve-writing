Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see that the fitness has been declining slightly (0.7320 → 0.6995 → 0.6970 → 0.6965). The evaluator seems to reward letters that achieve a balance between raw emotional honesty, literary sophistication, and specific intimate details while avoiding overwrought metaphors or excessive length.

Based on the evaluation notes, the highest-scoring letters succeed through:
1. Specific, mundane details that feel lived-in
2. Philosophical depth without pretension  
3. Vulnerability that feels earned, not performed
4. Simplicity in crucial moments
5. A unique voice that doesn't try too hard

Let me craft a new version that aims to improve the fitness score by focusing on these elements:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm terrible at beginnings. So let me start with the end: I love you. Not beautifully. Not poetically. Just completely.

It happened on a Tuesday. You were reading the ingredients on a cereal box out loud, practicing your English pronunciation. "Riboflavin," you said, three times, getting it wrong each time differently. That's when my life split into before and after. Before that Tuesday. After that Tuesday. Everything that matters happened after.

You think you're ordinary. Last week you spent forty minutes teaching our neighbor's kid how to tie his shoes because his parents were "too busy." You leave water bowls for street cats in summer. You still write thank-you cards by hand. Leyi, ordinary people don't glow from the inside when they talk about photosynthesis. They don't name their sourdough starter "Kevin" and apologize when they forget to feed him.

I need to tell you something: I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of flying, of commitment, of that space between sleeping and waking where you're not sure what's real. But you—you walk through the world like fear is just another language you decided not to learn. When I'm with you, I forget to be afraid. Or maybe I remember that being afraid is just another way of being alone, and I'm not alone anymore.

Three things I know:
1. You can't sleep if the dishes aren't done.
2. You cry at every movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because "what if something happens to it?"
3. When you love someone, you love them with your whole body—I've seen you love your sister, your students, that plant you rescued from the clearance shelf. It's terrifying and beautiful, like watching someone set themselves on fire to keep others warm.

I used to think love was about finding your other half. But I was whole when I met you. You were whole too. We're not two halves making a whole—we're two wholes making something else. Something that doesn't have a name yet. Something that sounds like your laugh at 1 AM when you remember a joke from three weeks ago.

Here's what I'm offering: Wednesday groceries and Sunday crosswords. Bad coffee I'll pretend is good because you made it. Sitting in waiting rooms holding your hand while doctors tell us things we don't want to hear. Dancing in the kitchen to no music. Fighting about whether to get a dog (we both want one but pretend we don't). Growing old and strange and specific together.

The ring in my pocket belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for 67 years, never took it off. When she was dying, she pulled me close and said: "Find someone who makes you forget you're going to die." I found you. You make me forget everything except this: we're alive, right now, together. What else could possibly matter?

I'm not promising you perfection. I still can't fold fitted sheets. I'll forget birthdays. I'll say the wrong thing at the worst moment. But I promise this: every morning I wake up, I'll choose you. When you're impossible. When I'm worse. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you like a reflex, like breathing, like gravity.

You told me once that you don't believe in soulmates. Good. I don't either. Soulmates are for people who think love is magic. Love isn't magic—it's a decision you make every day. It's choosing to see the same person with new eyes every morning. It's saying "yes" to all of it—the mundane Tuesdays, the hard conversations, the way you leave cabinets open like you're airing out the kitchen.

So this is me, asking you to keep choosing me. To marry me. Not because we're meant to be—nothing is meant to be. But because we decided to be. Because out of all the accidents in the universe, the accident of us is the one I want to keep having.

Say yes. Or don't. But know this: you've already changed the shape of my life. I'm different now, in all the permanent ways. I eat slower. I notice birds. I save the fortunes from fortune cookies because you taught me they're tiny poems. I am irreversibly yours.

Warren

P.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in forever? I said no. I lied. Forever is your hand finding mine in the dark. It's you saying "tell me about your day" and meaning it. It's this. It's us. It's already happening.
