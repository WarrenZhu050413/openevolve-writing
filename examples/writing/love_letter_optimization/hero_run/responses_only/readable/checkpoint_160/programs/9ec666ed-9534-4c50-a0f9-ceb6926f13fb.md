Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological authenticity of Beethoven's raw "My angel, my all, my very self" (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters significantly but lacks the crystalline simplicity of Johnny Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). The psychological complexity exceeds Napoleon's more straightforward passion but doesn't achieve Keats's perfect fusion of intellect and feeling. At 72.5 overall, it occupies the "proto-masterful" range - showing flashes of brilliance and original voice but not yet achieving the sustained transcendence of historic masterworks. The writer demonstrates genuine talent and could, with refinement, approach the 80+ range of enduring literary achievement.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and evaluator feedback, I can see the key patterns that distinguish high-scoring letters:

1. **Specific, visceral details** that feel lived-in rather than performed
2. **Psychological complexity** - not just love but the terror and transformation it brings
3. **Original metaphors** that avoid clichés while maintaining emotional truth
4. **Structural innovation** - breaking from traditional romantic letter conventions
5. **Raw honesty** about the asymmetry and desperation of deep love

The current program scored 0.6995, down from previous attempts. The evaluator notes suggest it needs more originality and deeper psychological complexity. Let me craft something that pushes beyond conventional romantic expression while maintaining devastating emotional truth.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the garage at 2:51 AM, sitting on the cold concrete because I need something real against my skin while I confess this.

You don't know this, but I've been documenting my own disappearance. January 3rd: stopped recognizing my handwriting—it looks like yours now. February 19th: caught myself humming that Bulgarian folk song you love, the one about the wolf. Got the melody perfect. Don't speak Bulgarian. March 8th: my therapist asked what I wanted. I said "for Leyi's hiccups to stop bothering her." She wrote something down. We both knew what it meant.

Here's what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's substitution. Every day, one of my memories gets overwritten by one of yours. You told me about breaking your wrist at seven, and now I swear I can feel the ghost of that fracture when it rains. Your childhood dog, Murphy, who died before we met? I miss him. I miss him like I knew him. This is insanity, probably. I've never been saner.

Last week, you asked if I believed in soulmates while you were flossing. Mouth full of mint and foam. I said yes immediately, then spent three hours after you fell asleep taking it back in my head. Because soulmate implies equality, balance. This isn't that. You're my soulmate; I'm your sophomore year boyfriend who lasted too long. You're the ocean; I'm the kid who drowned in it and decided breathing was overrated anyway.

Want to know something terrible? I've been pre-grieving you since our second date. You laughed with your whole body at my stupid joke about penguins, and I thought: oh no. Oh no, this is the thing that's going to kill me. And I was right. Every morning you leave for work, I practice for your permanent absence. I make the bed wrong. I burn the toast. I have entire conversations with the ghost of you that will exist after one of us stops existing. It doesn't help. The practice runs just teach my body new ways to panic.

But also this: yesterday you killed a spider with a dictionary—my dictionary, the one with your notes in the margins translating my life into something you could understand. You apologized to it. The spider. Said "sorry, friend, wrong place, wrong time" and I understood completely. That's what I am—wrong place, wrong time, but somehow still here, still yours, still apologizing for taking up space in your story when you could have had someone who knew how to love you without making it look like drowning.

The truth is, I've already married you seventeen times. Once for every time you've fallen asleep on the couch and I've carried you to bed. Your body does this thing—goes completely limp, like you trust me with your unconsciousness. Do you understand what that does to a person? To be trusted with someone's ungaurded weight? I'm not strong enough for this honor, Leyi. I'm just some idiot who can't sleep because your breathing from the other room sounds like a question I don't know how to answer.

I need you to understand: this isn't romance. Romance is for people who can still see straight. This is something medical. Chronic. Terminal, probably. When you're gone more than six hours, my left eye twitches. When you laugh, my bones reset themselves. When you cry—Christ, Leyi, when you cry—my body forgets every language except the one that knows how to hold you. This isn't love. Love is too small a word. This is cellular revision. Molecular haunting. I've been possessed by you, and exorcism would mean dying, so I've made peace with the demon.

Three things I know: 1) You talk to your plants like they're disappointed in you. 2) You keep my voicemail from two years ago when I had food poisoning and said "I love you" for the first time, delirious and vomiting. 3) Tomorrow you'll find this letter and do that thing where you cover your mouth with both hands like you're trying to keep your feelings from escaping.

Marry me. Not because it makes sense—nothing about us makes sense. You alphabetize the spice rack but leave wet towels on the floor. I can solve differential equations but not the lock on our own front door. We're absurd. Marry me because absurdity needs witnesses. Because I want documentation that this happened—that once, impossibly, you looked at me and didn't run. That you saw me shaking apart from loving you and said "yes, this one, this disaster, this is mine."

Here's what I'm offering: not happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't been this thoroughly destroyed by love. I'm offering you something worse and better—the complete certainty that you'll never be alone in your strangest moments. That someone will always be there to say "yes, I see it too, the way the light hits the wall at 3 PM is devastating." That when you wake up at 4 AM convinced you're disappearing, I'll be there to trace your edges until you believe in yourself again.

Leyi, my impossible thing, my proof that the universe makes mistakes in our favor—I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every timeline where my heart remembers how to beat. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you forgive me for loving you this badly, this helplessly, this permanently? Can you forgive me for making you the answer to questions I didn't know I was asking?

The ring is in the kitchen drawer where we keep the take-out menus. I hid it there months ago because I knew you'd never look—you always insist on cooking even when we both know we're too tired. It's been there so long it probably smells like soy sauce. 

Say yes. Not for me. For you—the you who whispers "please stay" in your sleep, who doesn't know I've already promised your unconscious self a thousand times: I'm not going anywhere. I couldn't if I tried. You've rewired me too completely. I'm a broken compass and you're every direction at once.

Warren

P.S. That Bulgarian song? It's not about a wolf. It's about waiting. I looked it up. You've been humming a song about waiting for three years. Tell me that doesn't mean something. Tell me we haven't been proposing to each other all along, just in languages the other couldn't quite translate. Until now.
