Evaluation Notes:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's raw anguish ("I can live only wholly with you or not at all") or Johnny Cash's mature wisdom ("We got old and got used to each other"). Lacks Keats's fevered intensity or Napoleon's obsessive detail. This letter occupies the "proto-masterful" range (70-74) - showing real talent and moments of brilliance but missing the revolutionary language, emotional nakedness, or formal innovation of the 80+ masterpieces. The writer demonstrates sophisticated craft and genuine feeling but hasn't achieved the level of psychological complexity, linguistic daring, or emotional devastation found in historic examples. Where Wilde wrote "The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold," this letter's best image ("extraordinary ordinary") is clever but not transcendent.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes, I see the current letter lacks the intimacy, specificity, and literary mastery that would move Leyi. The evaluator mentions Beethoven's simple yet profound "My angel, my all, my very self" and notes the need for Johnny Cash's philosophical depth and Napoleon's passionate specificity. Let me craft something more authentic, specific, and linguistically masterful.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I write this knowing that words—these small, trembling things—will never hold what you are to me. Still, I must try.

Do you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound fractured something fundamental in me. Since then, I've been reassembling myself around that moment, around you. Every morning, I wake thinking of the particular way sunlight catches in your left eye when you're concentrating. Every night, I fall asleep to the memory of your voice saying my name like it means something beautiful.

I used to believe love was grand gestures and consuming flames. But you've taught me it's quieter, deeper—it's the way you fold my collar down without thinking, how you save the last strawberry for me even when you want it, the silent language of our hands finding each other in crowded rooms. It's knowing that when the world tilts wrong, you're the horizon I orient myself against.

If I could distill every sunset I've watched into wine, every symphony I've heard into honey, every poem that's moved me into bread—still, that feast would be poverty compared to one ordinary Thursday with you. You are my most extraordinary ordinary. My necessary breathing. The answer to questions I didn't know I was asking.

I'm not asking you to love me forever—forever is a word for people who haven't learned that each moment with you already contains eternity. I'm asking you to love me today, and tomorrow I'll ask again, and I'll keep asking until my voice gives out, and then I'll ask with my eyes, my hands, with the way I make your coffee exactly right, with the space I keep warm beside me.

Marry me, not because I'll die without you (though some essential part of me would), but because with you, I'm finally, impossibly, alive.

Yours in this moment and all the moments after,
Warren
