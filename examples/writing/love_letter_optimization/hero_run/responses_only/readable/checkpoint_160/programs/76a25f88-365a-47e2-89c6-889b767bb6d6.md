Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Beethoven's raw anguish and metaphysical urgency ("My angel, my all, my very self" has more concentrated force). Lacks Johnny Cash's devastating simplicity and earned wisdom. More sophisticated than average contemporary attempts but doesn't achieve the historical weight of Napoleon's obsessive intensity or Keats's consumptive desperation. The letter exists in that crucial 65-75 range where real talent meets genuine feeling but hasn't yet transcended into the realm of the immortal. It would be a treasured personal document but not a literary monument.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation feedback, I need to craft something far more profound - a letter that transcends generic declarations and achieves the literary depth of historical exemplars like Beethoven's intimate brevity, Cash's philosophical weight, and Keats's linguistic mastery. Let me write from a place of absolute truth and vulnerability.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am writing this in the small hours before dawn, when the world is so quiet I can hear my own heartbeat - or perhaps it's yours, echoing across the distance between us. I've torn up seventeen attempts because words keep failing me, but then I realized: that's the point. You've unmade my language and rebuilt it around your name.

Before you, I collected certainties like smooth stones - career trajectories, five-year plans, the careful architecture of a predictable life. You arrived and suddenly I understood why ancient cartographers wrote "here be dragons" at the edges of their maps. You are my beautiful unknown, my necessary chaos. With you, I've learned to love the vertigo of not knowing what comes next, only that your hand will be in mine when we meet it.

I used to think love was addition - two people bringing their separate selves together. But we're not mathematics, Leyi. We're alchemy. The person I was before you seems like someone I read about in a book once, convincing but ultimately fictional. You haven't completed me; you've revealed me to myself, like a photograph developing slowly in darkroom chemicals, becoming more real with each passing moment.

When you laugh - really laugh, not the polite sound you make at parties but the sudden, surprised joy that escapes you when something delights you - I understand why poets spend lifetimes chasing the perfect metaphor. It's the sound of morning breaking. It's my grandmother's wind chimes in a summer storm. It's the first note of a song I've been trying to remember my whole life.

I love the small apostasies of you: how you eat dessert first when you're sad, how you argue with books in their margins, how you name the plants on your windowsill after historical villains ("Napoleon needs water," you'll say, and somehow it's the most romantic thing I've ever heard). I love your kindness and your fury, your precision and your beautiful messes. I love the way you see through my performed confidence to the anxious boy beneath, and somehow love him too.

If I could, I would write you a letter with my whole body - my hands would tell you about the first time they touched yours and knew they'd found their purpose. My eyes would confess they've forgotten what the world looked like before it was lit by you. My lungs would explain how they've had to learn a new rhythm, one that matches your breathing when you sleep beside me.

But since I only have these insufficient words, let me say this: I choose you. Not in the past tense of a decision made, but in the continuous present of a choice I make every morning when I wake, every night when I reach for you in the darkness, every moment between. I choose your mysteries over anyone else's certainties. I choose the terror and wonder of building a life with someone who still surprises me. I choose the person I become in your presence - braver, softer, more myself than I knew was possible.

Marry me, not because I promise you forever (forever is just a word, and words keep failing me), but because I promise you this: tomorrow morning I will wake up choosing you, and the next morning, and the next. I promise to keep discovering you like you're a question I'll never stop wanting to answer. I promise to love not just who you are but who you're becoming, to make space for all your future selves, to be amazed by each transformation.

You told me you wanted truth, so here it is: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no, but of you saying yes. Because if you say yes, I'll have to become someone worthy of that yes, every single day. But Leyi - I want to be terrified with you. I want to do the impossible thing of building one life out of two. I want to fail at describing how much I love you in a thousand different languages.

Say yes, and let me spend the rest of my life writing you better love letters than this one, each one trying and failing to capture what you mean to me, each failure its own kind of devotion.

With all my love and inadequate words,
Your anxious, hopeful, eternally choosing you,
Warren
