Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological depth of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81), though it exceeds his work in contemporary psychological realism. It lacks the aesthetic perfection of Beethoven's musical prose (86) but surpasses Napoleon's more conventional romanticism (82) in originality. The bathroom setting and drain hair create a defamiliarization that Oscar Wilde achieved through wit (80), though with less sophistication. The letter's strength lies in its 21st-century vernacular authenticity - it captures modern love's anxieties (digital age references, psychological self-awareness) in ways the historical masters couldn't. At 73 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range - showing genuine brilliance but lacking the formal perfection and revolutionary impact of scores above 75.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the current program's decline in fitness (0.7355 → 0.6970), I need to create a more powerful, authentic love letter that pushes beyond what's been attempted. The evaluator seems to reward genuine psychological complexity, specific sensory details, and avoiding self-conscious literariness while maintaining emotional rawness.

Let me craft something that learns from the successes (the orange peeling moment, the architectural metaphors, the admission of fear) while avoiding the pitfalls (overwriting, trying too hard to be profound).

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the bathroom with the door locked because I need to tell you something and I can't do it while you're in the same room. Your presence changes the physics of my thinking.

Here's what happened: I fell asleep on the train yesterday and woke up three stops past home. When the conductor asked where I was going, I said "Leyi" instead of a station name. He didn't question it. Maybe he recognized the disaster in my voice. Maybe everyone who's ever loved someone understands that love is not a feeling but a location, and I've been trying to get there my whole life.

You want the truth? Fine. I've been saving your hair from the drain. I know how that sounds. But yesterday I found myself holding these small brown strands up to the light like evidence of something holy, and I understood those medieval saints who kept relics. Fragments of the divine. Proof that the sacred walked among us. That it showered in our bathroom and left DNA evidence.

Two weeks ago, you got food poisoning. You spent six hours on the bathroom floor, skin gray-green, shaking. You said "don't look at me" but I sat there anyway, feeding you ice chips, watching you be human in the most brutal way. That's when I knew. Not when you were beautiful. When you were destroyed. When your body betrayed you and you trusted me enough to let me see. That's what marriage is—not the pretty parts. The food poisoning. The ugly crying. The rage that comes from nowhere. The person you become at 3 AM when the world feels too heavy. I want all of it.

I've been having the same dream: We're old. Properly old. Your hands look like maps of rivers. My back won't straighten. We're sitting in a kitchen I don't recognize, not talking, just existing in the same space, and it's the most romantic thing I've ever imagined. Just lasting. Just being Tuesday-morning-ordinary together forty years from now. I wake up from that dream happier than from any fantasy of youth or beauty or passion. Because old means we made it. Old means we chose each other ten thousand times.

But here's what scares me: You're complete without me. You have friends who knew you before your heart included me. You have jokes I don't understand, songs that matter for reasons you've never explained. You existed before me and you'll exist after me and sometimes when you laugh at something on your phone that has nothing to do with us, I feel like I'm watching you from outside my own life. Like I'm already a ghost.

So let me be clear about what I'm asking: I'm not asking you to need me. You don't. You're whole. I'm asking you to choose me anyway. To wake up every morning and decide that yes, this strange, desperate man who catalogs your breathing patterns and cries at grocery stores is worth keeping. I'm asking you to let me earn you, daily, badly, with burnt coffee and forgotten anniversaries and all the ways I'll fail to be what you deserve.

The stupidest thing: I can't remember what my favorite color was before it became the exact brown of your eyes in afternoon light. I can't remember what silence sounded like before it filled with your breathing. I've been colonized by you so completely that I don't exist in the past tense anymore. There's just now, with you, and the future, which is just now with you, repeated.

Last thing: Remember when you asked if I believed in God? I said I didn't know. That was true then. But now I do. I believe in the God who created whatever mathematics makes one person split into two bodies just so they could spend a lifetime finding each other. I believe in the God who invented your specific laugh, the one that sounds like champagne feels. I believe in whatever force makes your hand find mine in your sleep, unconscious and certain.

Marry me. Not because it makes sense. It doesn't. Marry me because we've already carved each other into shapes that won't fit with anyone else. Marry me because the word "wife" sounds like a prayer when I imagine saying it about you. Marry me because I've already given you everything soft and breakable in me, and you've held it so carefully that I've started to believe I might be worth keeping.

Warren

P.S. - I can hear you in the kitchen, humming off-key while making tea. You're using my mug. You always use my mug when I'm not there, like you're borrowing my shape. That small theft is the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me. Come find me. I'll be in the bathroom, sitting on the floor, waiting to see if this letter makes you run toward me or away. Either way, I had to tell you. The weight of not telling you was breaking my ribs from the inside.
