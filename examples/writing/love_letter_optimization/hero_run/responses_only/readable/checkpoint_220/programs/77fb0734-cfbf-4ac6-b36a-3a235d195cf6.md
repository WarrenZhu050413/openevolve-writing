Evaluation Notes:
This letter operates several tiers below Beethoven's raw spiritual urgency ("my life, my all, my very self") or Johnny Cash's earned simplicity ("We got old and got used to each other"). While it exceeds average contemporary attempts through its scientific-romantic fusion, it lacks the inevitability of great love letters. Keats achieved more with "I cannot exist without you"—five words of pure necessity—than this letter manages with its calculated vulnerabilities. The letter's strength lies in isolated moments (the "we need milk" observation rivals Napoleon's domestic intimacies) but lacks the sustained sublime force of historical masterpieces. It reads like a talented writer performing authenticity rather than a lover who happens to write.

Summary:
Looking at the current program and the evolution history, I can see that the best-performing version scored 0.7440 with strong phenomenological authenticity (0.78) and affective force (0.76). The current version at 0.7010 has room for improvement, particularly in aesthetic virtuosity and literary innovation.

The evaluator notes consistently mention that while these letters approach greatness, they lack the "economy and spiritual depth" of masters like Johnny Cash, the "prosodic mastery" of Beethoven, or the "universal resonance" of the greatest love letters. The key seems to be finding a balance between raw authenticity and literary craft.

Let me create a version that pushes harder into unexplored territory - one that combines devastating honesty with more innovative formal elements and deeper aesthetic precision:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

The truth is a blade. Here—take it:

I am thirty-one years old and have been dying since the moment I understood you could die first. This is not metaphor. My cells literally age faster from the stress of loving you. Scientists would call it oxidative damage. I call it the price of admission.

Let me be precise: At 11:43 PM on a Thursday you don't remember, you fell asleep with your hand on my chest. Your fingers twitched—dream movements, synaptic ghosts. In that twitch I saw our whole arc: meeting, marriage, children, aging, one of us watching the other stop breathing. The entire story, compressed into two seconds of involuntary muscle spasm. I stayed awake until dawn, counting your heartbeats like a rosary against the dark.

You wanted honesty? I rehearsed your name 10,000 times before we met. Not knowing you existed, just the shape of you, the you-shaped hole in language that needed filling. Every girlfriend before you was practice. I loved them like learning scales before playing Chopin. Forgive me. Or don't. The truth doesn't require absolution.

Here: more truth. When you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one, but the one that breaks out of you like an escaped prisoner—my amygdala floods with the same chemicals our ancestors felt seeing the sun after winter. Evolutionary biology reducing us to chemistry. But also: transcendence. Both true. The paradox of meat that dreams.

I've done the math. If we're lucky: 19,710 days. If typical: 14,600. If the universe is cruel: countless variations of less. I lose fourteen minutes of sleep per night calculating probabilities. Those stolen minutes add up to three months of consciousness I've sacrificed to anxiety about losing you. The irony is perfect and terrible.

But listen—this is important—I choose it. The shortened telomeres, the cardiovascular damage from chronic worry, the neurons worn smooth from repetitive fear. I choose the biological degradation of loving you over the pristine preservation of not loving you. I would rather burn down to ash in fifty years with you than last a century as museum-quality loneliness.

You think I'm romantic. I'm not. I'm a pragmatist who did the cost-benefit analysis and discovered that a life without you is technically longer but functionally pointless. Like a heart that keeps beating after brain death. Medically alive, philosophically extinct.

Yesterday you used the word "sonder"—the realization that everyone has a life as complex as yours. But you're wrong about me. My life isn't complex. It's binary. You/not-you. Together/apart. Breathing/drowning. The simplicity is humiliating. I had ambitions once. Now I have you. The trade wasn't fair to my former self, but he's dead now anyway, murdered by the first time you said my name correctly.

Marry me. Not because I love you—love is too small a word, like calling the ocean "damp." Marry me because I've already paid the cellular price. Because my hippocampus has restructured itself around your presence. Because divorce would require literal brain surgery.

Marry me because Tuesday you said "we need milk" and I heard "we." Just "we." The casual assumption of continued shared existence. That pronoun was a prophecy and a promise and I built a cathedral around it in my head.

Marry me because I know you read the last page of books first, terrified of unhappy endings. I can't promise happy. I can promise this: however it ends, I'll make sure you're not alone for it. Even if I have to haunt you. Especially then.

Here's the ring: my grandmother's, stolen from my mother's jewelry box. She'll forgive me when she meets you. Everyone forgives everything when they meet you. It's a superpower you don't know you have.

The stone is flawed—a carbon impurity that jewelers call a "cloud." Perfect. We're all just carbon, temporarily arranged into consciousness, clouded with the defect of knowing we're temporary. Wear it as a reminder that even our flaws are made of stars.

Say yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours at the molecular level. The decision is just paperwork for the atoms.

Warren
(who would marry you in every parallel universe, including the ones where we're different species)

P.S. I lied. This is the eighteenth draft. The others were prettier but less true. You wanted truth. This is what truth looks like: ugly and luminous and irreversible as fusion. Handle with care. Or don't. It's already too late for both of us.
