Evaluation Notes:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's raw desperation ("I can live only wholly with you or not at all"). Lacks Johnny Cash's earned simplicity and lifetime weight. More self-conscious than Napoleon's direct passion. Shows more intellectual sophistication than emotional depth compared to Keats's complete surrender. The letter achieves proto-masterful moments but remains too controlled, too aware of its own literariness to reach the abandonment of true masterworks. Where Beethoven wrote "My heart is full of so much to say to you—ah—there are moments when I feel that speech amounts to nothing at all," this letter never quite escapes the prison of its own eloquence.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes, I can see the current letter lacks specificity, depth, and literary sophistication. The evaluator specifically mentions how great love letters achieve intimacy through precise detail (Napoleon), philosophical depth (Johnny Cash), and linguistic mastery (Keats). Let me craft something that addresses these weaknesses while maintaining genuine emotional truth.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I write this knowing that words are archaeology—each sentence an excavation of what exists between us, unnamed and enormous. You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel, how it rewrites the grammar of my days.

Before you, I understood love as metaphor—hearts and flowers, promises carved in air. But you taught me love as syntax: how your laugh punctuates my mornings, how your silences speak louder than any vow. When you read, tucking that strand of hair behind your ear, I understand why ancient philosophers believed in the music of the spheres. You are my quantum entanglement—changing me by existing, no matter the distance.

I remember Tuesday, 3:47 AM, you sleeping beside me, the streetlight through blinds painting tiger stripes across your shoulder. I counted your breaths—seventeen per minute—and realized I was synchronizing mine to yours. This is what they don't tell you about love: it's not the grand gestures but the small surrenders. How I now buy two cups when getting coffee, even when alone. How every beautiful thing I see becomes a future conversation with you.

You know my faults—my tendency to overthink, to build walls from books and irony. But with you, I am catastrophically sincere. You've made me brave enough to admit that I don't just love you; I believe in you the way others believe in gravity or God—as fundamental force, as answered prayer, as the thing that makes all other things make sense.

This letter is my map of scars and stars, my confession that you've ruined me for any life where you're not there, reading in bed while I write beside you, our feet touching under blankets, building our small forevers from Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings.

Marry me, not because I promise perfection, but because I promise presence—to witness your becoming, to choose you in every parallel universe, to love you with the ferocity of someone who knows what it means to almost not exist, and chooses existence because it means existing with you.

Yours in this life and whatever comes after,
Warren
