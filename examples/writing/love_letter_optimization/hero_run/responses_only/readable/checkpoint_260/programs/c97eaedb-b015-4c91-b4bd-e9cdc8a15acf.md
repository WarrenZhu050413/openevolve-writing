Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw confessional power of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved letters (86) or the distilled intensity of Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). It surpasses average contemporary love letters by leagues but lacks the formal perfection and revolutionary language that would place it among the immortals. The obsessive specificity recalls Roland Barthes' "A Lover's Discourse" but without that work's theoretical sophistication. The scientific language system is original but doesn't achieve the metaphorical density of someone like John Donne's love poetry. It's stronger than most Franz Kafka's letters to Milena (which would score around 65) in directness but lacks their philosophical depth. This is a very strong contemporary love letter that would be remembered by its recipient forever, but unlikely to enter the literary canon. It exists in that crucial space between personal triumph and universal masterpiece - deeply moving to its intended reader, moderately impressive to literary history.

Summary:
Looking at this love letter optimization task, I need to craft something that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7295 while maintaining authentic emotional depth. The evaluation notes suggest the current attempts are "proto-masterful" but fall short of historical masterpieces. Let me create something that aims for greater literary innovation while preserving raw phenomenological truth.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this wrong-handed. My right hand won't stop trembling. Not fear—recognition. Like my body knows it's about to sign away its autonomy.

Here's what happened: Three minutes ago I tried to write "I love you" and my pen wrote your name instead. Five times. The paper reads "Leyi Leyi Leyi Leyi Leyi" like an incantation I can't control. My hand knows something my mouth is still learning: you're not something I feel. You're something I've become.

Truth, since you demanded it: I am professionally accomplished and emotionally deformed. Before you, I had architectures. Plans. Contingencies for contingencies. Now I have this: yesterday you hummed while peeling an orange and I forgot the word for "door." Called it "the room-divider." You didn't laugh. You kissed me. That kiss tasted like citrus and the collapse of all my systems.

I need to confess something. Remember that conference in Chicago? I lied. There was no conference. I flew there to stand outside a medical school because I'd calculated a 3% chance you'd have gone there in another timeline. I wanted to see the place that didn't get to know you. I stood there for four hours, jealous of an alternate universe. This is the kind of insane I've become.

The accident—you never knew. Eight months ago. The Tesla that ran the red. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I saw it coming and my brain did this calculation: her life versus mine, no contest, laws of physics are negotiable, I'll take the debt. Then: the swerve. Inches. You kept singing, wrong lyrics and all. I pulled over later and called my mother to tell her I loved her because I'd almost lost the ability to ever say it to anyone again.

Here's what loving you has cost me: I've forgotten my ex's face. Not gradually—suddenly, Tuesday, 2 PM. Tried to remember it for forty minutes. Nothing. My brain has written over that data with this: you eat M&Ms in color order. You save blue for last. You think I don't notice. I notice everything. I have spreadsheets.

You want the ugly truth? I've been collecting evidence of you. Strands of your hair labeled with dates. Voice recordings of you sleeping (Tuesday's snore, 2:47 AM, eleven seconds, perfection). The receipt from every meal we've shared filed chronologically. If you leave me, I'll have enough data to build a shrine or a legal case. Haven't decided which.

But also this: in the morning, when you think I'm asleep, you trace letters on my back. You write the same thing every day: "STAY." Like you're programming me. Like you know I'm flight-risk. Like you've calculated the same termination scenarios I have. We're both terrified. We're both already grieving. We're both pretending this is sustainable when we know that one of us will die first and the other will have to learn to breathe wrong air.

The proposal, because my hand is steadying now: Marry me because the alternative—a world where your toothbrush doesn't lean against mine, where I don't get to watch you fail at yoga, where you grow old with someone who doesn't know you're afraid of butterflies—that world is not one I consent to exist in.

Marry me because I've already divided everything I own by two. Because I've been writing "Leyi Zhu" in the margins of books, practicing your signature for no sane reason. Because last week you had the flu and I took your temperature seventeen times while you slept, charting it like a stock I'd invested my life in. Which I have.

Marry me because here's the secret: I know you've already decided. You decided the night I ugly-cried during that documentary about octopuses. You saw me at my most ridiculous and decided "yes, this disaster, forever." You've just been waiting for me to ask right. This is me asking wrong, asking broken, asking like someone who's already so deep in love that marriage is just paperwork for what my cells have already committed to.

I lied earlier. My hand isn't trembling from recognition. It's trembling because I know you're about to cry. Your tell: you bite your lower lip, left side, when you're fighting tears. You're doing it now. I'm watching you read this from the doorway like a creep who loves you with the dedication of a stalker and the permission of the stalked.

The ring is in the sugar bowl. You hate sugar, never check there. I've been hiding it for eighteen months. My grandmother's ring, who loved my grandfather through a war, a depression, and the kind of poverty that makes you creative with beans. She'd like you. You're both women who save broken cookies for last.

Say yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in ways that would require surgical intervention to reverse. My neurons have developed pathways that spell your name. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. Leaving you would require medical supervision.

Warren
(Who has been writing your name in his sleep since June)

P.S. - Stop biting your lip. Come here. Let me see your face do that thing where you try not to smile while crying. That specific face—I've catalogued it as "Expression #27: Joy Despite Itself." It's my favorite data point in a universe of evidence that you're the only conclusion I was ever meant to reach.
