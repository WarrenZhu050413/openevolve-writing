Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Beethoven's cosmic simplicity ("my angel, my all, my very self"—no excess, pure recognition). Lacks Johnny Cash's earned wisdom and biographical weight. More linguistically ambitious than Napoleon's directness but sacrifices his aristocratic control. Approaches Keats's fevered intensity but without his supernatural music. The letter exists in the 70-74 range where genuine talent meets occasional overreach—seeds of brilliance compromised by self-conscious literariness. The shower drain hair detail approaches the transgressive intimacy of truly great love letters, but surrounding purple passages dilute its power.

Summary:
Looking at the program history and current performance, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current plateau of 0.7320. The evaluator notes consistently mention that while these letters achieve genuine feeling, they fall short of the "historical masterpieces" scoring 80+. The key weaknesses identified are:

1. Lack of mythic/cosmic dimension (vs Beethoven's "immortal beloved")
2. Contemporary self-awareness that limits transcendence (vs Keats's fevered dissolution)
3. Missing formal mastery and emotional sublimity

To break through, I'll attempt a more radical approach - embracing raw vulnerability while reaching for something more timeless and universal. I'll focus on pushing the boundaries in phenomenological authenticity and affective force while maintaining the distinctive voice that's working.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

There is a violence to how much I love you. Not harm—but the way lightning loves the earth, the way roots crack concrete, the way your absence feels like missing organs I didn't know I had.

I'm writing this with my father's pen, the one he used to sign my birth certificate, his divorce papers, his will. It feels right to use something that has witnessed beginnings and endings to tell you this: you are my only beginning that doesn't end.

Here's what they don't tell you about truth—it's not elegant. Truth is that I've been saving your hair from the shower drain. I keep it in an envelope marked "Evidence." Evidence of what? That you existed in my Tuesday. That you made my bathroom holy. That I have become the kind of man who saves hair like relics, who understands why medieval peasants died for splinters of the cross.

You wanted honesty, so here: when you sleep, I match my breathing to yours until we become one organism with two hearts. I've done the math—we've shared 31,536,000 breaths since we met. I'm keeping count. When I die, I want the number carved on my chest: "He breathed her 247,293,600 times."

Do you remember the sparrow that flew into our window last month? You held its broken body and wept like it was your child. That's when I understood—I don't love you like a man loves a woman. I love you like religion loves doubt, desperately, necessarily, each making the other real. You are my beautiful heresy. My grace.

I've been practicing dying. Small deaths. Imagining you gone so I can feel the relief when I open my eyes and you're still there, reading ingredients on cereal boxes like they're poetry. This is insane. But sanity is a country I burned my passport to the moment you laughed at my worst joke and the sound reorganized my molecular structure.

The ring in my pocket has worn a hole through the fabric. Three months of carrying this question has physically changed my clothes. You've worn me down to threads, Leyi. I'm more hole than pocket now, more space than substance, except for this terrible certainty that without you I'm just organized loneliness pretending to be a person.

Last Tuesday, the old woman at the farmers market asked if we were newlyweds. You said "Not yet" with such certainty that my knees buckled. Not yet. Present tense walking toward future tense. You had already decided. You were already mine. I just hadn't asked.

So I'm asking. With my father's pen and my mother's tendency to love too hard. With hands that shake when I think about tomorrow without you. With a heart that has developed a arrhythmia that spells your name in morse code.

But really, Leyi, this isn't a question. It's a surrender. White flag, hands up, I give up trying to be myself without you. Marry me because I've already been colonized by your laughter. Because you've made me understand why people used to die of consumption—consumed by something that makes breathing both necessary and impossible.

I'm not offering you poetry. Poetry would be insulting. I'm offering you the truth: that I am a broken hallelujah with your name as the only lyric. That you could ask me to walk into traffic and I'd only ask which lane moves faster toward you. That I've been writing your eulogy since the day we met because I needed to practice saying goodbye to the only thing that would kill me to lose.

This is my nineteenth draft. The others I burned, ate, buried in the yard like evidence of a crime. The crime of trying to make this beautiful. It's not beautiful. It's necessary. Like breathing. Like you.

Marry me. Or don't. But know that I'm already yours in the way that rain belongs to the earth—inevitably, repeatedly, with grateful violence.

I love you past language, past logic, past the point where love becomes something else—oxidation, chemical dependency, evolutionary imperative. I love you in the stupid, cellular way that makes me understand why atoms split—not because they want to, but because containing that much energy in one space would unmake the universe.

Yours in this unmaking,
Warren

P.S. I can hear you in the kitchen, burning toast again. The smoke alarm is singing. This is what paradise sounds like—you, burning things, the house filling with proof that you're home.
