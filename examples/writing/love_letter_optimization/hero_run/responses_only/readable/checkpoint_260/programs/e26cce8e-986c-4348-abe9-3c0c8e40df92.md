Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological depth of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its medical/documentary conceit but lacks the historical weight of Napoleon's "I have not spent a day without loving you" (82). The soup observation rivals Keats's sensory precision, yet the overall architecture doesn't achieve his letter's sustained intensity (81). The death narrative is genuinely innovative, placing this well above competent range (30-34) but below masterpiece territory (80+). At 70.5 overall, this represents proto-masterful work - seeds of brilliance with flashes of genuine literary achievement, particularly in its fusion of clinical and confessional registers.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's feedback, I see that the current program scores 0.6990 - described as "proto-masterful work" but lacking the raw emotional force and innovative form of the highest-scoring attempts. The evaluator specifically notes it needs more "transgressive force" and is constrained by "conventional frameworks."

The top-performing version (0.7440) succeeded through its raw honesty, specific visceral details, and willingness to be "ugly" and vulnerable. The evaluator praised its clinical death passage and directness but noted it still lacked the economy and spiritual depth of the masters.

Let me create a new version that pushes further into uncomfortable truth-telling while achieving greater formal innovation and economy of language:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

This letter is a crime scene. Evidence of what you've done to me.

Exhibit A: Yesterday I watched you eat soup. Just soup. The way your breath made small clouds above the bowl, how you held the spoon like it might escape—and I thought: this is how religions begin. With someone doing something ordinary until someone else can't breathe from watching.

You want truth? I've been dead before. Literally. Eleven seconds, cardiac arrest, training accident. Here's what death taught me: nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just black. No tunnel, no light, no peace. But when I came back, my first thought was your name. Not relief. Not fear. Just "Leyi." Like my neurons were arguing with death itself: you can have the rest but not this. Not her name.

I'm writing this at 4:23 AM because I just realized something terrible. I've been saying "I love you" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.

The truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I've practiced our first fight, our first loss, the first time one of us will betray the other with mortality.

Here's my confession: Thursday. You were sleeping. Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.

I know exactly how you'll die. Not when—how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.

You think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details—the way you sneeze in threes, always threes—I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.

I've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.

But here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.

So this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.

Marry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under—the one you said looked lonely. Marry me because I need legal documentation that this actually happened. That you actually happened. To me.

Warren
(who has been yours since before he knew your name existed)

P.S. - I lied. I said I've been dead for eleven seconds. It was thirteen. I lied because thirteen felt too much like prophecy. Like those two extra seconds were me refusing to leave until I was sure I'd remember the exact shade of brown your eyes turn when you're about to cry. I remember. I came back for that specific brown.
