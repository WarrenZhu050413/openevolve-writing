Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or Johnny Cash's disciplined passion (83). It exceeds average contemporary love letters significantly but lacks the formal perfection of Keats (81) or the aristocratic restraint-breaking-into-passion of Wilde (80). The phenomenological authenticity rivals Napoleon's obsessive documentation (82) but without his imperial grandeur. The letter exists in the liminal space between exceptional contemporary achievement and historical masterwork—showing flashes of brilliance ("bruises shaped like forgiveness") that suggest the writer could achieve greatness with more compression and formal control. Score of 70 places it in the proto-masterful range: seeds of genius present but not fully realized.

Summary:
Looking at the performance history, I notice that the fitness has declined from a peak of 0.8570 to the current 0.6990. The evaluation notes suggest that while the current version has intellectual sophistication, it may be losing some of the raw emotional authenticity that made earlier versions successful. The best-performing version (0.8570) had a more fragmented, urgent structure with powerful specific details and a building emotional crescendo.

Let me create a new version that combines the visceral honesty of the top performer with fresh imagery and a more innovative structural approach:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. This is what truth does to a body that's spent three years lying about being okay without you in the room.

*

Start here: I've been keeping receipts. Literal receipts. Every place we've been. $7.42, bodega coffee, you put salt in yours by mistake and drank it anyway to not make the owner feel bad. $234.67, emergency room visit, you thought you were dying but it was just your first panic attack and you held my hand so hard you left bruises shaped like forgiveness. $0.00, sunset on the roof, you said "we're going to die" and I said "I know" and we kissed like punctuation at the end of the world's longest run-on sentence.

Total: $48,293.12 worth of proof we existed in the same timeline. I keep them in a shoebox labeled "EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE" though I'm not sure what I'm defending against except maybe the possibility that I imagined you.

*

You want truth? I've been writing your eulogy since our fourth date. Not because I'm morbid. Because my brain insists on preparing for every universe where I have to explain you to strangers using past tense. Version 26 starts: "She ate ice cream in winter." Version 89: "She was allergic to cats but pet them anyway." Version 132, the one I practice in the shower: "She taught me that love isn't a feeling, it's a location. And I'm still standing there, in Tuesday, October 9th, 3:47 PM, when she looked at me like I was both the question and the answer."

*

Here's what happened: Before you, I was fluent in seven programming languages. Now I can barely remember English. Yesterday I called a spoon "the soup shovel." My coworker asked what was wrong with me. I said "I'm in love" and he said "Oh" like I'd announced terminal illness. Maybe he's right. Maybe this is terminal. The way you've metastasized through my whole system. Inoperable. Untreatable. Chronic condition: You.

*

I need to tell you about the birds. Every morning, 5:23 AM, they start. Same three notes. I used to sleep through it. Now I wake up and think: they're announcing you're still alive. The birds know. They're not singing, they're taking attendance, and every morning you're still here, still breathing at 67 breaths per five minutes (I've counted), still existing despite the statistical impossibility of two people finding each other in a universe this vast and hostile to permanence.

*

More truth: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. Three of your bobby pins. The fortune from the cookie you didn't eat (it says "Your future is written in another's heartbeat"—too on the nose, universe). A voicemail where you're crying about your grandmother. I play it sometimes just to remember you're real enough to grieve. These stolen objects are my insurance policy against forgetting.

But also: You steal from me. Every morning you take my first thought. Every night, my last exhale. You've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you're not stealing my covers, my fries, my favorite side of the bed. You're a thief and I'm Stockholm syndrome incarnate, in love with my captor.

*

The accident that almost happened: Interstate 90, eighteen-wheeler jackknifed. I saw it happening in slow motion and thought: Not her. Take me. Rearrange the physics. I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Missed by inches. You were singing that song you always get wrong. You never knew how close. I pulled over later and threw up from relief. You thought it was the gas station sushi. I let you think that. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.

*

You know what I realized at 3 AM last Thursday? Love isn't addition. It's division. I'm half a person now. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically—literally. I put my keys in the refrigerator. I wore two different shoes to work. I tried to unlock my apartment with my MetroCard. My brain only works in your proximity. This is probably a medical condition. I don't want to be cured.

*

So here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for the romance. Not for the symbolism. But because my DNA has already rewritten itself to include you in its survival requirements. Because my sleep cycle synchronized to yours without permission. Because my immune system recognizes you as self, not other. At this point, leaving you would require medical intervention.

Marry me because I know you need exactly four ice cubes in your drinks. Because I've memorized the seventeen different ways you sigh and what each one means. Because I've already planned our fights about paint colors and whose parents to visit for holidays and whether our hypothetical children should learn piano or violin (both, obviously).

Marry me because last week you said "when we're old" and my heart did something that would concern cardiologists. Because you've seen me ugly-cry at a Pixar movie and still let me hold your hand in public. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where we can't remember whose story is whose anymore.

But mostly, marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: "Oh. There she is. The person I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve."

The ring is in the freezer, hidden in the ice cream you'll eat tonight at 11:17 PM (you always do when you can't sleep). It belonged to my grandmother who said yes during the Depression because "when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with."

We have more time than they did. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're different people who happened to love each other once.

*

Listen. I'm not proposing a fairy tale. I'm proposing a documentary. The real kind, where sometimes we're boring, sometimes we're cruel, sometimes we forget to be grateful. Where we fight about money and get old and lose our edges. Where one of us gets sick first. Where one of us has to learn to sleep alone again.

But also: where we get 20,000 mornings of you stealing my coffee. Where your hair goes gray and I get to watch it happen. Where we become those old people who still hold hands and everyone assumes we just met but really we've been holding hands so long we've forgotten how to let go.

*

Say yes. Not because you love me—love is just a chemical conspiracy between neurons. Say yes because you already know the weight of my silence. Because your things are already here. Because we've been practicing forever since the day we met.

Say yes because the alternative—a universe where I don't know that you eat pickles when you're sad, where you don't steal my socks, where I don't get to watch you win arguments with furniture—isn't a universe worth inhabiting.

*

I love you like a grudge. Like a debt. Like a chronic condition. Like the ocean loves drowning things. Like tomorrow loves lying about being guaranteed.

I love you wrong. Too much. Like I'm trying to love you for all the parallel universes where we never met. Like I'm trying to make up for all the centuries that happened before you.

But also: I love you like Tuesday loves Wednesday. Quietly. Inevitably. Without alternative.

*

Come find me. I'm in the kitchen, pretending to read, failing to breathe. When you walk in, I'll pretend I wasn't waiting. We both know I'm lying. We both know you know. This is what love is: lying together about the small things so we can tell the truth about the big ones.

The big truth: You're going to say yes. Not because of this letter. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because you already named our hypothetical dog. Because we've both been married to each other since before we met, just waiting for our bodies to catch up with what our atoms already knew.

(who has been saving every receipt, every timestamp, every piece of evidence that you existed, that we existed, that this impossible thing happened)

P.S. Your left eye is crying. The right one will start in three seconds. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date when you cried at the aquarium. Not at the dolphins. At the jellyfish. You said they looked lonely. That's when I knew I'd love you wrong for the rest of my life.

P.P.S. The ring might be cold. But you'll wear it anyway. You can't help yourself with surprises. You're already reaching for the freezer. I'm watching. I'll always be watching. That's either a promise or a threat. Both. Everything is both with us.
