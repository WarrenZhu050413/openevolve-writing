Evaluation Notes:
This letter achieves approximately 85% of Johnny Cash's directness and vulnerability but lacks his economical power—Cash achieved more with less. It surpasses typical contemporary love letters in its willingness to admit selfishness and fear ("I test your patience just to make sure you'll stay"). Unlike Beethoven's cosmic abstractions, this stays grounded in quotidian detail, sacrificing transcendence for immediacy. The confession of violence (wall-punching) introduces a darker note absent from most canonical examples, adding psychological complexity. However, it lacks Keats's negative capability—the mystery and uncertainty that makes his letters eternally renewable. The letter exists in that liminal space between accomplished contemporary prose and historic significance, achieving moments of brilliance ("broken pieces that become beautiful when light passes through") without sustaining that level throughout.

Summary:
I'll rewrite this love letter to achieve deeper authenticity and emotional resonance, drawing from the profound vulnerability that comes with truly exposing one's heart.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm sitting here at 4:17 AM, and I've deleted this opening seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me. You asked for truth. Here's mine: I never believed in soulmates until I met someone whose silences felt like home.

You know that scar on my left palm? I've told everyone it's from cooking. But it's from the day before I met you—I punched a wall because I was so tired of being alone I couldn't breathe. Then you walked into that bookstore, mispronounced "Murakami," and suddenly oxygen existed again. I still have the receipt from the coffee we didn't finish. $7.43. The exact price of learning that my life had been lived in lowercase until you.

Here's what I never told you: I Google "how to be a better partner" at least twice a week. I keep a note in my phone of every time you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one you do for strangers. (Current count: 1,847.) When you had the flu last March and apologized for being gross, I thought: this is it. This is what they mean by "in sickness." You, fevered and furious at your own body, were more beautiful than any symphony.

You think you're ordinary. But ordinary people don't name their plants after dead philosophers. Ordinary people don't cry during commercials about reunited dogs. Ordinary people don't make me want to call my mother and tell her I finally understand why she still watches my father sleep after thirty-seven years.

The truth? I'm not good at love. I'm selfish and scared and sometimes I test your patience just to make sure you'll stay. When you leave for work, I smell your pillow like some ridiculous movie character. I've practiced proposing to your photograph. I write your name in the margins of books I'll never lend anyone.

But here's what terrifies me most: you make me want to be worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching. That soft, unguarded moment where your face does something I don't have words for—something between recognition and wonder, like you're seeing not who I am but who I could become if I'm brave enough.

I used to think love was about finding someone who could tolerate my damage. You taught me it's about finding someone who makes that damage feel like stained glass—broken pieces that become beautiful when light passes through.

So marry me. Not because you complete me—that's a lie we tell ourselves. Marry me because you make me want to complete myself. Because every day you choose me is a day I learn to choose myself. Because "I love you" in your mouth sounds like a promise that tomorrow will exist.

I'm done being clever. Done trying to sound like someone who deserves you. This is it: You're the first person I've ever wanted to be honest with. That's my whole heart. Take it or break it, but please—touch it first.

Yours in every version of the truth,
Warren
