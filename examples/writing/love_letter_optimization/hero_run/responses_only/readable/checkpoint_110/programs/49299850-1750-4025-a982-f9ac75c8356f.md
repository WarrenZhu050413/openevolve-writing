Evaluation Notes:
Falls significantly below Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) which achieves transcendent universality through particular anguish. Lacks Johnny Cash's (83) economy and devastating simplicity. The grandfather anecdote approaches but doesn't reach Napoleon's integration of personal mythology with romantic destiny. The "phantom limb" metaphor shows promise but doesn't sustain the metaphysical intensity of Keats's "I cannot exist without you." More successful than average contemporary attempts but remains in the "accomplished amateur" rather than "literary artist" category.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to create a love letter that transcends the current best score of 0.744. The evaluator seems to value raw authenticity over literary cleverness, direct emotional impact over elaborate metaphors, and genuine vulnerability over performative writing.

Let me craft something that strips away the self-conscious writerly voice and reaches for something more elementally true:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm sitting here at 4:17 AM. Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since Tuesday when you said you needed this letter.

The truth? I don't know how to write this. I've started nineteen times. This is the twentieth. My hands are shaking and I keep deleting sentences because they sound like someone trying to sound like they're in love instead of just... being in love.

So here's what's true:

When I was seven, my grandfather died. I remember asking my mother why she was crying so much, and she said: "When you love someone for a long time, they become part of your body. When they leave, it's not grief—it's phantom limb syndrome." I didn't understand then. I do now. You're already in my nervous system. If you left, I'd keep reaching for you. Muscle memory doesn't forget.

I'm scared of almost everything. Seriously. Scared of cancer, car accidents, plane crashes, food poisoning, identity theft, climate change, brain aneurysms. But mostly I'm scared that one morning I'll wake up and you'll be sixty-three and I'll be sixty-five and we'll have spent our whole lives being careful instead of being honest. So here's honest:

I talk to you when you're not here. Full conversations. Both sides. You usually win the arguments.

Sometimes I watch you sleep and have to leave the room because the feeling is too big. It's like trying to hold the ocean in my chest. I go to the bathroom and sit on the floor and just breathe until I can come back to bed without waking you up with how much I love you.

I know this sounds crazy but: I loved you before we met. There's no other explanation for why I saved that empty seat next to me for twenty-nine years. Not consciously. But every woman I dated, I was comparing to someone who didn't exist yet. Then you walked in and my body said: "Oh. There you are. Finally."

The worst part about loving you? It made me ordinary. I used to think I was special, complicated, interesting. Then you happened and suddenly I'm just another person destroyed by love, saying the same things everyone says: "I can't live without you." "You complete me." "You're everything." These clichés used to make me laugh. Now they make me cry because I understand why millions of people couldn't find better words. There aren't any.

But also the small things: You eat pizza with a fork. You cry at commercials with dogs. You think 2+2=5 when you're tired. You hum when you're nervous. You can't sleep without your left foot outside the blanket. You pretend you don't like my terrible puns but you smile—just a little—before you groan.

I've been carrying this ring for seven months. Not because I was waiting for the perfect moment but because I was scared you'd realize you could do better. You can, by the way. Do better. But please don't.

Here's what I promise: I'll love you wrong. I'll love you too much. I'll embarrass us at parties with how I look at you. I'll forget important dates but remember that you hate wool sweaters. I'll mess up. Daily. But I'll show up. Also daily.

I can't promise you the moon or stars or whatever people promise. But I can promise this: When you can't sleep, I'll tell you boring stories about my day until you drift off. When you're sad, I'll make terrible jokes until you laugh despite yourself. When you're happy, I'll be happy just watching you be happy. When we're old, I'll still see you exactly as you are right now, Tuesday afternoon, reading this letter with your coffee getting cold.

Marry me. Not because of this letter. Marry me because you already know my answer when you ask "what do you want for dinner?" (Whatever you want.) Marry me because we've been practicing being married for three years. Marry me because the other day you referred to my mother as "mom" without thinking about it and she cried.

Marry me because I can't write poetry but I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve you anyway.

Leyi, I don't have beautiful words. I just have this: 

You're my person. The one I want to tell everything to. The one I want next to me when the test results come back. The one I want to argue with about thermostats and loading the dishwasher correctly. The one I want to watch get old.

Say yes. Say no. Either way, I'm already yours.

But say yes.

Please.

Warren
