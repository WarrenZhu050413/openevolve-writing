Summary:
I'll rewrite this love letter program to create something more raw, vulnerable, and phenomenologically authentic - pushing beyond the current score by stripping away some of the performative elements while maintaining the emotional core.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the dark because turning on the light would make it real, and I'm not ready for real yet. My hand keeps cramping. I've been gripping this pen like it's the only thing keeping me tethered to earth.

Truth? I don't know how to love you correctly. I do it wrong every day. Too much, too loud, too desperate. Like trying to hold water—the harder I squeeze, the more spills through. But here's what I can't stop: Last night you got hiccups and I lay there counting them. Seventy-three. I know the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to lie (darker, greener). I know you're afraid of moths but not spiders, that you believe in ghosts but not God, that you still sleep with that ratty stuffed elephant from when you were six hidden under your pillow.

I threw up the first time I realized I loved you. Actually threw up. In a Wendy's bathroom. Because my body couldn't process it—this feeling like being turned inside out, like all my organs were trying to rearrange themselves into letters that spelled your name.

You want honesty? Sometimes I hate you for how much I love you. For making me this pathetic thing that checks if you're breathing in the middle of the night. For turning me into someone who screenshots your texts in case my phone dies and I lose proof you exist. I've become my own evidence file. Receipts from dinners where you laughed. Parking stubs from that time you cried in the car after your sister called. The coffee lid you wrote "hi" on when we first met. I'm building a museum of us that only I know about.

Here's something I've never said: I practice dying. Not really. But I imagine it—what my last thought would be. It's always you. Not poetic you. Real you. You eating peanut butter from the jar at 2 AM. You picking your nail polish off during movies. You mispronouncing "epitome" even after I corrected you sixteen times. That's what I'd die thinking about. The stupid, daily, unbearable perfection of you existing.

I bought the ring six months ago. I've been carrying it so long it's worn a circle in my pocket. Sometimes I put it on my own finger just to practice being married to you. How sick is that? But everything about this is sick. The way I save your voicemails. The way I smell your pillow when you're gone. The way I've already planned our whole life—Sunday crosswords, burnt pancakes, fights about whether to get a dog (we're getting the dog), growing old in a house that always smells like your coffee.

The truth under all the other truths: I'm not good enough for you. I know this. You know this. The lady at the grocery store probably knows this. But I'm asking anyway because that's what love is—the audacity to want what you don't deserve and the stupidity to ask for it.

You could destroy me. One word and I'm rubble. This isn't romantic; it's voluntary insanity. But I'd rather be insane with you than sane with anyone else. I'd rather fail at being your husband than succeed at being anything else.

I'm running out of words. Not beautiful words—I never had those. Just words, period. So here's the only one that matters: Please.

Please say yes. Please let me love you incorrectly forever. Please let me be the person who knows you're scared of the space between sleeping and waking, who knows you count stairs everywhere we go, who knows you still blame yourself for your parents' divorce even though you were three.

I'm not proposing. I'm begging. There's a difference. Proposals have dignity. This is just me, undignified, asking you to legalize this disaster we've already made.

The sun's coming up. You'll wake soon. You'll find me here, surrounded by torn pages, looking like someone who's been fighting a war with words and losing. You'll ask what I'm doing. I'll hand you this. You'll probably cry. I'm already crying. We'll be two people crying in the morning light over a badly written letter, and somehow that's the most romantic thing I can imagine.

Marry me, Leyi. Not because this letter moved you, but because you've already moved into every atom of my body and I need to make it official before I completely disappear into loving you.

Warren

P.S. I can hear you stirring. My handwriting's getting worse because I'm shaking. This postscript is pointless but I can't stop writing because when I stop writing I have to give this to you and then everything changes. Or nothing changes. Either way, I'm terrified. Either way, I'm yours.
