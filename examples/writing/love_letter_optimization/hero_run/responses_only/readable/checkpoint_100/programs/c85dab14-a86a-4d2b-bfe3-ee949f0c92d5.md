Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the current program's significant fitness decline (0.6970 → 0.2445), I can see the issue. The current letter is too brief, generic, and lacks the specific, vulnerable details that made the previous versions successful. 

The top-performing programs all share certain qualities:
1. **Specific, intimate details** about the beloved (bobby pins, grandfather's watch, eating sandwiches from inside out)
2. **Self-aware vulnerability** (admitting flaws, fears, obsessive behaviors)
3. **Rejection of clichés** while embracing mundane truth
4. **Length and depth** - all successful versions were substantially longer
5. **Unique voice** with contemporary authenticity

Let me create a new version that recovers these strengths while exploring a different emotional territory:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

It's 3:34 AM and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all the profound stationery felt like a lie. You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.

I need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me—singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.

The truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently—not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.

You want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.

Here's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this—your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.

I love the way you mispronounce "specifically" as "pacifically" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.

But more than that—I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.

The paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.

So here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates—I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me—I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.

I'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.

You wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.

I love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.

Yours in this reality and whatever comes next,
Warren

P.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost—the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.
