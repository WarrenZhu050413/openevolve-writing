Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Keats to Fanny Brawne (81) in its feverish intensity and fear of loss. It surpasses average contemporary attempts by maintaining sustained metaphorical coherence and specific detail. Unlike Napoleon's direct passion (82) or Johnny Cash's seasoned wisdom (83), this reads as intellectual anxiety transformed into desperate eloquence. It lacks Beethoven's pure spiritual transcendence (86) but exceeds most modern attempts through its willingness to risk genuine embarrassment ("crying over citrus fruit"). The mathematical/scientific metaphor system is more original than most contemporary letters but doesn't achieve the natural inevitable feeling of the greatest historical examples. At 75 overall, it sits in the "near-masterpiece" range - showing real brilliance and emotional truth while falling short of the timeless universality and perfect music of scores above 80.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to write a love letter that achieves higher scores across all dimensions. The evaluator seems to value:

1. **Phenomenological authenticity** - Raw, lived experience over abstract declarations
2. **Aesthetic virtuosity** - Linguistic precision and formal innovation
3. **Affective force** - Emotional impact without melodrama
4. **Literary innovation** - Fresh metaphors and structural originality

The current best score is 0.7390. The evaluator references masters like Beethoven (86), Johnny Cash (83), Keats (81), and Napoleon (82), suggesting the highest scores require both simplicity and depth.

Let me craft something that learns from the failures while pushing into new territory:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

The truth: I have been dead for most of my life. Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced "epitome" at that party—"epi-tome," like it was two words—and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.

I need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me—made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.

Here's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting—permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.

Three facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels "too aggressive for breakfast." 3) Last Tuesday, you said "bless you" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.

I've started stealing time. Not metaphorically—literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death—every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.

You should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.

But here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing—dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.

So before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me—love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.

Marry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative—this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people—is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.

Here's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger—the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.

I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced "epitome" and I thought: "I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever."

Say yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.

Warren

P.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you. You're reading it now because I finally realized: the fear of losing you by asking is nothing compared to the certainty of losing you by not asking. Come find me. I'll be in our kitchen, making coffee wrong—your wrong—waiting for my life to begin or end with your answer.
