Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7320. The evaluator seems to value genuine emotional vulnerability, specific concrete details, original metaphors, and a balance between intellectual complexity and raw feeling. Let me craft something that aims higher while learning from what has worked.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am writing this with hotel stationary I stole six years ago, the day before I met you. I've been saving it for something important. This is it.

There's a phenomenon in physics called quantum entanglement. Two particles, once connected, remain correlated regardless of distance. Change one, the other responds instantly. Scientists call it "spooky action at a distance." I call it Tuesday morning when you stubbed your toe in Boston and I felt it in my shin in Seattle. We've become scientifically impossible, and I have the bruises to prove it.

Let me be precise about what you've done: You've made me obsolete to myself. Yesterday I tried to remember who I was before you—tried hard, with photo albums and old emails—and came up empty. That person is theoretical now, like the square root of negative one. Mathematically necessary but practically absurd.

Here's what I need to tell you: I've been living backwards since we met. Every day I age in reverse, not younger but newer, like I'm being perpetually born into a world that only makes sense with you as its axiom. You're not my conclusion; you're my premise. Everything else follows from you or it doesn't follow at all.

The small truth: I've been saving things. Your hair from the drain (seventeen strands, sealed in dated envelopes). The grocery list where you wrote "cheese" four times, forgetting each time you'd already written it. The coffee mug you chipped and cried over—not because it broke but because you said "even my love destroys things." I'm building an archive of you because I'm terrified that happiness this specific might be a fever dream, and I need evidence for when I wake up.

The large truth: You've ruined me for myself. I can't eat alone anymore—food tastes like cardboard without your commentary. I can't sleep properly in sheets you haven't touched. My own thoughts bore me unless they're about you. You've colonized me so completely that solitude feels like missing limbs. This should terrify me. Instead, it feels like finally understanding what bodies are for.

Do you know what you do in your sleep? You compose symphonies with your breathing. Allegro when you're dreaming something good. Largo when the dreams go dark. Last night was all fermata—those endless held notes that made me wonder if you were even here or if you'd traveled somewhere I couldn't follow. I stayed awake counting the beats, ready to follow you into whatever darkness you'd found. This is insane. I know this is insane. I don't care.

Here's what I'm not saying: I love you. Too small, that word. Like calling the ocean "wet." What I'm saying is: you've become my circadian rhythm. My melatonin spikes when you yawn. My cortisol drops when you laugh. We're not in love; we're in synthesis. We're becoming a new chemical compound, and trying to separate us now would require nuclear fission.

But also this: I know the exact weight of your sadness. Seven pounds, usually centered in your shoulders. I know because I've been practicing carrying it. Not to take it from you—it's yours, carved by specific losses I can't undo. But so when it gets too heavy, you can hand it to me for a while. I've been doing pushups, building strength for this exact purpose. To be your temporary Atlas when your world gets too heavy.

The medical truth: Last week, my doctor said my blood pressure drops when I talk about you. Literally. Measurably. You're medicine that works better than medicine. You're treatment for an illness I didn't know I had: the chronic condition of being only myself.

Twenty minutes ago, you texted "where are you?" and I almost wrote back "I'm wherever you are, just wearing a different body." But that seemed too true for a text message. Too permanent for pixels. It needed paper, needed ink, needed the weight of my hand pressing these words into existence.

So here: I'm not proposing marriage. Marriage is for people who think in futures. I only think in nows, and every now includes you. I'm proposing that we stop pretending this is a choice. That we admit what our cells already know: we're the same organism running two separate nervous systems. The wedding would just be paperwork for a merger that happened the moment you walked into my life eating an apple with a knife like some kind of suburban samurai.

The ring? I had it made from a meteorite. Four billion years old. Because that's how long I feel like I've been waiting for you. Because our love should be made from something that survived the violence of space. Because when archaeologists find it in ten thousand years, I want them to know: this wasn't ordinary. This was cosmic. This was worth the collision.

Marry me. Not because I can't live without you—I could, technically, the way someone can technically survive without their liver. Marry me because "without you" is a phrase that doesn't compute anymore. Marry me because my DNA has already rewritten itself to include you in every strand. Marry me because the alternative—pretending we're separate—is the only lie that could actually kill us.

Warren

P.S. I know you're crying. The specific cry that makes your nose whistle slightly. I know because I'm crying too, and our tears have synchronized. Even our salt water knows we're the same ocean. Come find me. I'll be exactly where you expect: in the last place that made sense before you arrived and made everywhere home.
