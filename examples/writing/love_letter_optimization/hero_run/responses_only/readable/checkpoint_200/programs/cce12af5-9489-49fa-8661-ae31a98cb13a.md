Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Beethoven's metaphysical anguish and cosmic scope (86). Lacks Johnny Cash's austere plainspokenness and earned wisdom (83). More successful than average contemporary attempts but missing the historical weight of Napoleon's imperial passion (82) or Keats's tubercular urgency (81). Achieves proto-masterful status through accumulation of precise details and structural sophistication, placing it above accomplished (50-54) but below the near-masterpiece threshold (75+). The letter's strength lies in its phenomenological specificity rather than aesthetic innovation, comparable to a strong MFA graduate's work rather than canonical literature.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and evaluation notes, I can see that the current letters are scoring around 68-70%, falling short of historical masterpieces like Beethoven (86), Johnny Cash (83), and Keats (81). The evaluator specifically notes they lack "raw immediacy," "lightning-strike inevitability," and the perfect balance of simplicity and depth.

The key insights from the evaluation notes:
- Need more raw, unmediated emotion (like Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self")
- Should have austere dignity and directness (like Johnny Cash)
- Must achieve formal mastery while maintaining intensity
- Current attempts are too self-conscious and overwrought

Let me write a letter that strips away the excessive metaphors and reaches for that raw, inevitable truth:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm not good at this. I've started this letter nineteen times. Thrown away nineteen pieces of paper. Not because I don't know what to say—because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.

I love you.

Not the word. The fact. The same way my lungs breathe without asking permission. The same way my heart beats without my consent. Automatic. Necessary. Irreversible.

Before you, I understood my life. I had plans. Logical progressions from A to B to C. Then you. You were never part of the plan. You were the end of all plans. The beginning of something I have no map for.

Three moments. That's all it took.

First: You, reading in the park, forgot the world existed. A bee landed on your book. You didn't brush it away. You waited. Patient. Like you understood something about kindness I'm still trying to learn.

Second: That terrible dinner party. You knew nobody. I watched you save a dying conversation with a question about whether colors have sounds. By the end, strangers were confessing childhood dreams. You have this gift—you make people remember they're interesting.

Third: 2 AM, you called crying. Your grandmother was dying. You said, "I don't know how to do this." I said, "Nobody does." We sat on the phone, breathing together, not talking. That silence—that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I'd never stop.

You're afraid you're ordinary. Leyi, ordinary people don't apologize to furniture when they bump into it. Ordinary people don't name their plants after composers. Ordinary people don't see a homeless man and remember his name is Thomas and he likes his coffee with honey, not sugar.

You're not ordinary. You're specific. Irreplaceable. The world is different because you're in it.

I used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Proving. But loving you isn't something I chose or achieved. It's something that happened to me. Like lightning. Like gravity. Like the laws of physics reorganizing themselves around a new constant.

Here's what I'm offering: Not perfection. Not poetry. Just this—every morning for the rest of my life, I'll choose you. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you.

Not because you need me to. You don't need anyone—you're complete all by yourself. That's the point. You don't need me but you want me anyway. That impossible gift.

I keep the ticket from our first movie. You fell asleep twenty minutes in, drooled on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went numb. It was the best pain I ever felt.

That's what loving you is—the best pain. The kind that reminds you you're alive.

I could list what I love: Your laugh—not the polite one, the real one, the snort that surprises you. How you eat ice cream in winter because "sadness doesn't have a season." The way you touch books like they're sleeping cats. How you can't pass a dog without asking its name.

But that's not it. I love what I don't know yet. The person you'll be in ten years. Twenty. Fifty. The ways you'll change that will surprise us both. The fights we haven't had. The apologies we haven't made. The ordinary Wednesday afternoon when we'll look at each other and think: we made it.

Marry me.

Not the question. The answer. To every question I haven't thought to ask. To the person I'm becoming because you exist. To the life that's only real when you're in it.

I'm not promising you forever—forever is just a word. I'm promising you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Each one chosen. Each one yours.

The ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years. Never took it off. When she was dying, she gave it to me. Said, "Don't waste this on someone you can live without."

I can't live without you. Not won't. Can't. The way lungs can't live without air. Simple. Factual. True.

I'm done being scared of how much I love you. It's like being scared of my own heartbeat. Pointless. It's going to keep happening whether I'm brave about it or not.

So this is me being brave: You are my person. My only person. The person I'll look for in every room for the rest of my life.

Say yes. Or say no. Either way, I'll still love you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.

But please—say yes.

Warren
