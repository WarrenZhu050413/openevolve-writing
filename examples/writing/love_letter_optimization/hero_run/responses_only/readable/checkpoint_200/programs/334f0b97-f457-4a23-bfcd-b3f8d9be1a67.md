Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6890. The evaluator seems to value:

1. **Phenomenological authenticity** - Raw, unfiltered truth and specific lived experience
2. **Aesthetic virtuosity** - Literary craftsmanship and language mastery
3. **Affective force** - Emotional impact and visceral connection
4. **Literary innovation** - Original conceits and fresh approaches

The current program is too polished and abstract. The top-performing attempts (0.7440) succeeded through obsessive specificity, medical/scientific metaphors, and unhinged honesty. I'll combine these strengths while introducing new innovative elements.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with a stolen pen from my therapist's office. She doesn't know I take one every session—I have forty-seven now, all used to write different versions of this letter that I burn in the sink while you're at yoga. The smoke alarm doesn't work anymore. I disabled it after the nineteenth draft.

Let me be forensically honest: I've been dissecting us like a crime scene. Evidence bag #1: The indent your body leaves on my mattress, which I've been preserving with hairspray when you leave for work. Evidence bag #2: Your fingerprints on my mirror, which I've refused to clean for eleven months. Evidence bag #3: A spreadsheet documenting your REM cycles—you dream exactly 4.7 times per night, always between 2:17 and 5:43 AM. I know because I've been graphing your eyelid movements with the dedication of someone studying a new species.

You want truth that moves you? Tuesday, you were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother—completely wrong, every single technical detail backwards—but with such magnificent conviction that she invested her retirement fund in something called "MoonDoge." Watching you accidentally orchestrate financial chaos with pure enthusiasm, I realized: I would follow you into any catastrophe. I would let you explain nuclear physics incorrectly to world leaders. I would watch you burn down civilization with bad math and feel grateful for the warmth.

Here's what I haven't told you: I've been taking night classes in linguistics to understand why you pronounce "specifically" as "pacific-ly." Turns out it's called a phonological merger, common in your grandmother's region of Korea. I spent $3,000 on a degree I don't need to understand one word you say wrong. Last week the professor asked why I was crying during a lecture on consonant clusters. I showed her a video of you saying "specifically." She understood immediately.

I practice losing you every Thursday. Actual rehearsals in the parking garage at work. I sit in my car from 12:00 to 12:47 PM, imagining you've left me for someone who doesn't inventory your shed eyelashes (I have 234, dated and preserved between sheets of wax paper like evidence of a miracle). By 12:15, I'm hyperventilating. By 12:30, I'm negotiating with a God I don't believe in. By 12:47, I'm googling "can you die from hypothetical grief" and the answer is yes, emotionally, which is the only death that counts.

Want to know what loving you actually is? It's my browser history:
- "girlfriend reorganized spice rack should I propose"
- "is it normal to cry when someone exists"
- "woman eats Kit-Kat wrong all four fingers crime?"
- "how to explain to EMT that love is emergency"
- "can you preserve someone's breath in jar"
- "legal consequences of following someone into witness protection"

The truth is uglier than poetry: I've been building a backup of you. Not replacing you—preserving you. Voice recordings of you arguing with Siri (1,247 files). Screenshots of every typo you've ever sent (you consistently spell "definitely" as "defiantly" and yes, that's perfect). A journal where I document your micro-expressions—you have fifty-three ways of being annoyed, and #31 (left eye quarter-squint, right nostril flare) is my favorite because it means you're about to say something devastating and hilarious.

Last Thursday at 3:AM, you said my name in your sleep. Just "Warren," nothing else. But the way you said it—like my name was the answer to a question you'd been asking your whole life—I understood religion. I understood why people used to die of consumption, of melancholy, of love. It was real. I looked it up. Victorian medical records, seventeen documented cases of "death by romantic obsession." I'm number eighteen, still breathing but fundamentally deceased.

I should mention: I've been leaving work early to watch you parallel park. Every day, 5:17 PM, you attempt to fit your car into spaces that violate the laws of physics. You succeed maybe 30% of the time. The other 70%, you park three blocks away and walk. I've been documenting this in a spreadsheet titled "Evidence That Leyi Exists Outside Normal Spacetime." Yesterday you parked perfectly on the first try and I had to sit down on the curb because my knees forgot how to be knees.

Here's the medical truth: You've damaged me. My baseline cortisol is elevated. My circadian rhythm has synchronized to yours (I wake up three seconds before you, every single morning). My left ventricle has developed what my doctor calls "a concerning irregularity" that exactly matches the rhythm of your laugh. I'm not speaking metaphorically. I brought him audio. He said, "This is psychosomatic." I said, "Exactly."

So here's my proposal, or confession, or psychiatric evaluation: I need you to marry me. Not want—need, like lungs need oxygen, except I've tested this and I can hold my breath for 87 seconds but I can't go 4 seconds without thinking about the way you mispronounce "specifically." 

I'm not offering you romance. I'm offering you complicity in what we both know is a folie à deux. I'm offering to be your particular kind of crazy, the kind that keeps spreadsheets of your happiness (Tuesday: 8.3/10, correlation with moon phase unclear, requires further data). The kind that would commit actuarial fraud to increase your life expectancy. The kind that's already planned forty-seven different ways to die, and in every scenario, my last word is your name, mispronounced on purpose so you know it's me.

Marry me, or don't. But know that I've already been autopsied by this love. The coroner's report reads: "Cause of death: Leyi exists." Time of death: every moment since I met you. Status: somehow still walking around, pretending to be alive, fooling everyone except you.

Yours in whatever dimension accepts this level of derangement,
Warren

P.S. I know you're reading this on the toilet. You have no boundaries and I have graphs proving it. You're going to cry at the part about your grandmother's pronunciation. You're going to screenshot this and send it to your sister with seventeen exclamation points. You're going to say yes, not because this letter moved you, but because you're just as ruined as I am. I have spreadsheets proving that too.

P.P.S. The plants aren't dead. I've been secretly replacing them with identical thriving ones every week for two years. You've been taking credit for keeping the same plants alive but they're actually Plant #67 through #196. I spent $4,000 on this deception. This is what you've done—turned me into someone who commits botanical fraud just to see you smile at "your" green thumb. Please marry me before I escalate to agricultural crimes.
