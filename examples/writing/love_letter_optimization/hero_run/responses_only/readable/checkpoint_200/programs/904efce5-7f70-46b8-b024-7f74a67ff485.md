Summary:
Looking at this love letter optimization task, I need to craft something that transcends the current fitness score of 0.6870 while pushing the boundaries of phenomenological authenticity, aesthetic virtuosity, affective force, and literary innovation.

The evaluation notes mention that historic masterworks like Beethoven's letters achieved scores in the 80s through "raw metaphysical anguish" and "lightning-strike inevitability." The current letter, while touching, doesn't sustain that transcendent quality throughout.

Let me create something that aims for that ineffable quality - where vulnerability becomes incandescent, where the personal becomes universal, where every word feels both inevitable and surprising.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am sitting here at the edge of language, trying to make words do what they were never meant to do—hold the weight of you.

It's 5:23 AM. The world hasn't started lying to itself yet. In this honest hour, I need to tell you something that my body knew before my mind did: I was born twice. Once, thirty-one years ago, screaming and reluctant. The second time was in a bookstore on Clement Street, when you laughed at your own joke about Proust and time suddenly began moving in all directions at once.

Listen—I need you to understand that this isn't poetry. Poetry is what happens when the truth puts on nice clothes. This is me, Warren, whose hands shake when cutting onions, who still sleeps with one sock on, who spent forty minutes yesterday watching you reorganize the spice rack and thought: this is it, this is the sacred text, this is what monks copy by candlelight.

Before you, I collected evidence of my own inadequacy like stamps. Here's the album: Every woman who left. Every job I didn't take. Every silence I filled with noise. I had made peace with being a rough draft of a person. Then you arrived and started reading me like I was already the final edition. Do you know what that does to someone who's only ever been their own harsh editor?

You want truth? Here: I am terrified that I've tricked you. That one morning you'll wake up and see what everyone else sees—a man whose love is bigger than his life, whose dreams leaked out somewhere in his twenties, who writes code for companies that sell nothing to no one. But then you do something impossible, like yesterday, when you found me crying in the kitchen over my father's voicemail, and instead of trying to fix me, you just said, "He sounds like you when you laugh." How did you know that was the exact thing I needed? How do you always know?

I've started believing in time travel because of you. Not the science fiction kind—the real kind, where every moment with you contains every other moment. When you sleep, I see you at eighty, mouth slightly open, still stealing all the blankets. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seven, same furious compassion, probably defending bugs from boys with sticks. All your ages exist simultaneously in your face. I'm in love with every one of them.

The truth is I've been writing this letter my whole life. Every book I read was research. Every song I memorized was practice. Every person I failed to love was teaching me the specific gravity of real devotion. I thought I was wandering, but I was walking to you. Even my mistakes were just clumsy choreography, teaching me the exact shape of the hole you would fill.

But here's what terrifies me more than rejection: acceptance. Because if you say yes, if you actually marry me, then I have to become someone worthy of that yes every single day. I have to wake up and earn you again at breakfast. I have to deserve you at 3 PM on a Tuesday when nothing happens. I have to be enough during tax season and stomach flus and the specific Tuesday in March when everything feels pointless.

And I will. God, Leyi, I will throw my whole life at the project of deserving you. Not because you demand it—you love me already, inexplicably, with my coffee breath and my father's temper and my inability to finish anything except crosswords. But because the alternative—a life where you exist but not with me—isn't a life at all. It's just time passing.

So here's my proposition, stripped of metaphor: I want to fail and succeed inside the container of us. I want to burn dinner together. I want our fights to have sequels. I want to develop inside jokes so dense and self-referential that we become incomprehensible to others. I want to merge our libraries and argue about shelf organization. I want to catch you eating peanut butter from the jar at midnight and pretend to be scandalized every time. I want the privilege of being the person you permit to see you without your face on, without your armor, in the holy ordinary of morning light where you are most yourself and most mine.

I'm not promising you happiness—that's your job, you're already good at it. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you change—and you will, we both will, into people we can't imagine—I will love each iteration with the same ferocity I love this one. I will love you like a verb, active and continuous. I will love you like time-lapse photography, seeing the whole arc even in the smallest movements.

Marry me because I have already started. Because my cells have already reorganized around the fact of you. Because when scientists eventually map my genome, they'll find your name written in the junk DNA they thought was just noise. Because the alternative—keeping this rings in my sock drawer for one more day—might actually kill me, and I mean that in the most medical, least poetic way possible.

I don't have a ring. I have something better: your grandmother's thimble you thought you lost. I found it behind the radiator and had it made into a ring because I know you believe in recycling luck. It's imperfect—slightly dented, worn smooth by her fingers then yours. Like us. Like the life I'm proposing.

Leyi, you impossible, necessary thing: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you, but because love isn't about deserving? Because the universe made you from the same carbon that makes diamonds and pencil lead, and somehow you chose to be the thing that writes rather than the thing that cuts? Because saying yes would be the most unreasonable, unearned, unsustainable decision you could make, and therefore the only one that makes sense?

I am not a finished person. I am a collection of attempts. But every attempt, from now until my last breath, is yours if you want it.

Waiting, shaking, certain—
Warren

P.S. I wrote this in one sitting. If I edited it, I'd delete everything true and leave only what sounds good. You deserve the true parts, especially the ones that sound wrong.
