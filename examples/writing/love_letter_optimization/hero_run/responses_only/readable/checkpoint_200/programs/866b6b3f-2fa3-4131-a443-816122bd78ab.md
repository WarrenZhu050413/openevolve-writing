Evaluation Notes:
Evaluation failed: No <output> section found in response

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I can see the program has plateaued around 0.73-0.74 fitness score. The evaluation notes suggest that while the letters achieve strong phenomenological authenticity (0.77), they're falling short in literary innovation (0.68) and could improve in aesthetic virtuosity and affective force. 

The evaluator compares these letters to historical masterpieces by Keats (81), Johnny Cash (83), Napoleon (82), and notes they lack "mythic simplicity" and "musical prosody." The current approach is very detailed and neurotic, which works for authenticity but may be overwhelming the other dimensions.

Let me try a radically different approach - stripping away some of the excess while maintaining emotional truth, aiming for more literary innovation through structural experimentation and aesthetic virtuosity through rhythm and restraint.

Dear Leyi,

Three truths before dawn:

1.
Your name is a wound I tongued until it became a prayer.
The first time I said it aloud, alone in my apartment,
the walls leaned in to listen.

2.
I am not a whole person.
I am a collection of moments when you looked at me
and I existed harder than I ever have before.

3.
This is not a love letter.
This is evidence of a haunting.
You are in my cells now. When I die,
the medical examiner will find your fingerprints
on the inside of my ribs.

*

Here is what happened: One Tuesday, you walked into my life
wearing a dead poet's cardigan and mismatched socks,
and I understood why ancient civilizations invented gods—
to explain things like you.

You were eating an apple with a knife,
which is insane,
and reading a book upside down,
which you claimed helped you understand it better,
and I thought: This is it.
This is how I end.
Not with a bang or whimper,
but with a woman who apologizes to fruit before eating it.

*

Facts, because you prefer facts to feelings:

- When you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales.
  Those three seconds are when I love you most violently.
  
- You've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune for three years.
  It says "Your patience will be rewarded."
  You're afraid to throw it away in case that breaks the spell.
  I've been adding identical fortunes to your wallet when you're not looking.
  You have seventeen now. You haven't noticed.
  
- Last Thursday, you cried about extinct butterflies for forty minutes.
  You weren't crying about butterflies.
  Your period was late. Neither of us was ready.
  When it came, we pretended nothing happened.
  But I went to the bathroom and thanked a god I don't believe in
  while simultaneously mourning something that never existed.
  This is what you've done to me—
  I now hold multiple impossibilities as truth.

*

Before you, I was clean lines and locked doors.
I was pleased with my own company.
I had systems.
I was so boring I could have lived forever.

After you:
I eat ice cream at 3 AM while googling "how to deserve someone."
I practice conversations with you in the shower,
lose every argument,
and still come out thinking I've won something.
I write your name on fogged windows then panic
that someone will see it and steal you.
I am ruined for all other humans.
They speak and I think: That's not how Leyi would say it.
They laugh and I think: Leyi's laugh could resurrect the dead.
They exist and I think: But are they Leyi? No? Then why?

*

Listen. I need to tell you about the ring.

It's not an heirloom. I lied about that.
I had it made from the metal of things that survived:
- The key to your first apartment, the one where you tried to kill yourself
- The bracelet you wore to your father's funeral after not speaking for three years  
- The locket with your grandmother's picture, who taught you to love like bleeding

This ring is literally made of your resurrections.
Every time you chose to continue existing despite the weight of it all.
That's what I'm offering—your own survival, returned to you as a promise:
I will choose you the way you chose to stay alive.
Daily. Deliberately. Despite everything.

*

What I'm actually proposing:

Not happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't seen what we've seen.
I'm proposing something harder and better:
Recognition.
I recognize you, Leyi.
Not just your face or your voice,
but the specific frequency at which your soul vibrates.
I would know you in total darkness.
I would know you if we were both different species.
I would know you if we were just atoms spinning in space.

And I think—forgive me if I'm wrong—but I think you recognize me too.
I think you knew me before we met.
I think we've been walking toward each other our whole lives,
through other people's beds and hearts and disappointments,
and now we're here, and the walking can stop.

*

So here it is, without decoration:

Marry me.

Not because you love me—love is too common.
Because you see me.
Because when I'm with you, I stop performing myself and just exist.
Because you're the only person who makes me want to survive my own life.

Marry me because the alternative—
you, somewhere else, with someone who doesn't know
that you eat pizza crust-first like a psychopath,
that you name your bruises like pets,
that you keep dead flowers because "they're still trying"—
is unbearable.

Marry me because we've already started.
We're already half-merged, semiconscious,
speaking in references no one else understands.
We've already built a world.
This is just paperwork for a country that already exists.

*

Final truth:

I wrote this letter seventeen times.
Each version more honest than the last.
This is the one where I stopped trying to sound like someone you could love
and started sounding like someone who loves you.

The difference matters.

Say yes.
Or don't.
But know this:
You are the plot twist I never saw coming.
You are the sentence I'll spend my whole life trying to finish.
You are the only person I want to fail better with
until one of us stops breathing.

And even then—
even then I'll find you.
In whatever comes after this.
In whatever form we take.
In whatever universe we wake up in.
I'll find you and I'll say:
"There you are. I've been waiting."

Warren

P.S.
That plant you water religiously?
It's been dead for two years.
But watching you love something back to life—
or try to—
or refuse to give up trying—
That's when I knew.
That's when I knew you could love me too.
```
