Evaluation Notes:
This letter occupies the space between Keats's fevered metaphysical intensity (81) and contemporary literary fiction's psychological realism. It lacks Beethoven's cosmic scope ("My angel, my all, my very self" - 86) but exceeds average contemporary attempts through its accumulative power. Unlike Johnny Cash's dignified simplicity (83), this relies on neurotic specificity. The "1,247 times" device recalls Joe DiMaggio's daily roses to Marilyn's grave - obsessive quantification as love language. The houseplant proposal practice evokes Charlie Kaufman's cinematic vulnerability more than classical epistolary tradition. At 73 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range - showing genuine brilliance but lacking the sustained transcendence of scores above 80. It would be remembered as unusually good, not immortal.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation history and top-performing programs, I see a pattern: the highest scores (0.7320) come from letters that balance raw vulnerability with specific, visceral details. The current program at 0.6880 has beautiful language but may be too abstract in places. Let me craft something that combines the concrete specificity of the top performers with fresh, truthful moments.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this while you sleep. Your left hand is curled against your chest like you're holding something precious only you can see. I've been watching that hand for twenty minutes. This is what you've reduced me to—a man who memorizes the geography of knuckles at 3 AM.

You wanted truth? I'll give you the truth that makes me sweat: I've already married you 1,247 times in my head. Small ceremonies mostly. Once underwater. Once on Mars. Twice at that taco truck on Morrison Street because even my imagination knows you'd want those al pastor tacos at your wedding. In every version, you laugh when I mess up the vows. In every version, that laugh rewrites the laws of physics.

Here's what terrifies me: Before you, I was complete. I had organizational systems. I understood my life like a balanced equation. Now I'm all variables, no constants, except this: the sound of your key in the door has become my favorite song. I've turned into someone who saves your voicemails—not to replay them, just to know they exist. Insurance against the impossible thought of forgetting your voice.

Last Tuesday you cried about a documentary on octopuses. Not sad tears—amazed tears. You grabbed my arm and said "They have three hearts, Warren. THREE HEARTS." That's when I understood I would die for you. Not in some grand gesture. Just Tuesday, on our couch, you squeezing my arm about cephalopods, me realizing I'd give you all three of my metaphorical hearts if I could figure out the anatomy.

I need to tell you something: I've been documenting us. Secret photos of your coffee cups, each one with different lipstick marks like you're signing your mornings. Voice memos of you singing to the plants (they're dying anyway but you won't give up). Screenshots of texts where you called me "warren" lowercase when you were soft and "WARREN" when I forgot to eat again. This isn't creepy. Okay, it's a little creepy. But it's also the only way I know to prove this is real, that someone like you chose someone like me.

You know what haunts me? That night you had the flu. 102 fever. You kept apologizing for being gross while I held your hair back. You don't remember, but between retches you said, "I love you even though you can't parallel park." That's when I knew. Not the love part—I already knew that. But that you loved me DESPITE my complete inability to perform basic life functions. You've seen me at my smallest and still choose to make me feel enormous.

The mundane truth: I practice my proposal speech to your houseplants. Gerald (the fern) thinks I should lead with humor. Patricia (the succulent you refuse to admit is dead) suggests vulnerability. But here's what they don't understand—you've already destroyed my ability to perform. My hands shake when you look at me too long. My brain turns into dial-up internet sounds when you wear my shirts. How am I supposed to speak when you've replaced all my words with just your name repeated like a broken prayer?

I love you in the stupid way. The way that makes me check that you're breathing seventeen times a night. The way that has me creating contingency plans for zombie apocalypses where my only goal is getting to you. The way that makes me understand why people used to die from love—literally stop functioning because someone else became their entire operating system.

Listen. I'm not going to promise you perfection. I'm going to promise you this: every morning I will wake up and be stunned by the theft of you choosing me again. I will love you at your smallest and most difficult. When you're angry about the way people load dishwashers wrong. When you're crying about dogs you've never met. When you're explaining why that one specific shade of green makes you feel homesick for places you've never been.

The embarrassing truth is I've already built my entire future on the assumption you'll say yes. I've been saving for a honeymoon to that place in Iceland you mentioned once while half-asleep. I practice signing my name as "Warren, Leyi's husband" on receipts. I've already named our hypothetical cat Lieutenant Whiskers per your decree from six months ago when you were wine-drunk and making future plans.

So this is me, asking. Not with poetry or grace but with the desperate honesty of someone who's been permanently rewired by your existence. Marry me. Not because I deserve you but because I've already oriented my entire molecular structure around loving you and I'd like to make it official before my atoms figure out they could be doing something more reasonable.

All of me, catastrophically yours,
Warren

P.S. You're stirring now. In seven seconds you'll do that thing where you pretend you weren't drooling. In twelve seconds you'll steal all the blankets while claiming you don't. In fifteen seconds I'll fall in love with you again. This is my favorite recurring nightmare—the one where I get to keep you.
