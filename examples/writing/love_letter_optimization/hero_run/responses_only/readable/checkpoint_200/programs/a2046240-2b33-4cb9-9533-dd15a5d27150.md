Evaluation Notes:
Scores below Keats's raw passionate immediacy (81) and Cash's mature simplicity (83). While this letter achieves moments approaching those masters (particularly in its temporal philosophy and domestic specificity), it lacks Keats's pure emotional force and Cash's hard-won wisdom. The medical metaphor system, while cohesive, doesn't reach the archetypal power of Beethoven's "Immortal Beloved" (86) with its cosmic scope. However, it surpasses many contemporary attempts through its commitment to specificity and its resistance to pure sentimentality. The score of 71 (weighted average) places it in the proto-masterful range - showing real brilliance but held back by occasional self-consciousness and over-writing. Each point below the 80+ masterpiece level represents specific moments where craft overtakes authenticity or where innovation feels forced rather than inevitable.

Summary:
I'll rewrite the love letter program to improve its fitness score by enhancing emotional authenticity, literary innovation, and aesthetic virtuosity while maintaining raw affective force.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my left hand because my right one won't stop shaking. Not from fear. From the violence of finally understanding what you've done to me.

Listen: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I spoke it native, dreamt in its grammar. Now I stumble over solitude like a tourist. You've made me forget my mother tongue. When you leave for work, I stand in the doorway for full minutes, relearning how to exist in spaces you're not filling.

Here's what happened: Last Thursday, 2:47 PM, you were reading on the couch. Just reading. Your foot was doing that unconscious thing—tracing infinity symbols in the air. And I realized I'd been holding my breath for your entire chapter. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you—love is what civilians call this. This is something medical. Something terminal. You've metastasized through me so completely that removing you now would be self-murder.

I need to confess: I've been stealing from our future. Every night while you sleep, I live through entire decades of us. I've already watched you go grey (left temple first, age 47). I've already held you through your father's funeral (unexpected Tuesday, too much rain). I've already learned that you'll develop a tremor in your sixties but refuse to see a doctor because "it adds character." I'm living backwards from our ending, and every present moment is just me catching up to what I already know: that I'm going to love you until my atoms forget how to hold together.

The truth about that morning you found me crying in the kitchen: It wasn't my grandmother's death anniversary like I said. You had just put cinnamon in your coffee instead of sugar by mistake, made this face—like you'd been personally betrayed by the universe—then drank the whole cup anyway out of principle. And I understood something horrible: that I would rather watch you make that face every morning for the rest of my life than be happy with anyone else. That I'd trade every potential happiness for the specific gravity of your disappointments.

You think you know how I love you. You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I practice arguments with you in the shower—not to win, but to lose better, to disappoint you less efficiently. You don't know that I've already written your eulogy fourteen times because I'm terrified I'll be too broken to speak when the time comes, and you deserve words that work.

Here's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay without you. License to name this disease. I don't want to marry you because you complete me—that's arithmetic for children. I want to marry you because you've broken me so thoroughly that my shattered edges have scarred over in your shape. Because rebuilding myself without you would mean admitting you were removable, and that lie would kill me faster than any truth.

But also this: I want our specific ruins. I want to fight about whether ghosts exist while washing dishes. I want you to leave cabinet doors open like invitations to chaos. I want to develop our proprietary language where "Tuesday" means "I'm sorry" and "get milk" means "I choose you again." I want to become so fluent in your silence that I can parse the difference between "I'm thinking about my novel" quiet and "I'm remembering my mother" quiet and adjust the air accordingly.

The secret: There are two versions of me now. The one who exists when you're here—blood moving, synapses firing, fully operational. And the one who exists when you're gone—a museum of myself, lights off, everything under dust covers, waiting to resume living when you return. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I don't care. Healthy people haven't found what makes them terminal yet.

Three things I know: Your favorite word is "perpendicular" because it sounds like what it means. You trust birds but not their intentions. When you're about to cry, your left eye twitches twice, like it's asking permission. These are the coordinates of my religion. These are the things I'll remember when I've forgotten my own name.

So here's my offer: Not eternal love—eternity is a concept for people who haven't watched their person sleep through a thunderstorm, who haven't seen them ugly-cry at commercials about orphaned dogs, who haven't loved someone through food poisoning at 3 AM. I'm offering you something harder: Daily love. Mundane love. The kind that knows you need eleven minutes of silence after waking up. The kind that stocks your favorite tea even though I think it tastes like disappointment. The kind that chooses you at your smallest, most ordinary, most forgettable, and says: this, this is what I want to witness into oblivion.

Marry me. Not because we're ready—we're not. Not because it makes sense—it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is pretending this is voluntary, and we both know I passed the point of choosing you somewhere between the first time you laughed at my worst joke and the first time you cried in my car. Marry me because my cells have already voted, and it was unanimous.

The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket, where it's been for four months, developing its own heartbeat. I carry it like evidence that bravery exists somewhere in my body, waiting for activation. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will. For the us that's already started. For the future where we look back at this moment and think: that's where we admitted what our bodies had already decided.

Warren

P.S. I know you're crying. I know because I cried writing this, and we've synchronized so completely that you're probably tasting salt right now without knowing why. Come find me. I'll be wherever I always am when you need me—exactly where you expect, waiting to begin or end, but either way, finally honest about this beautiful disaster we've become.
