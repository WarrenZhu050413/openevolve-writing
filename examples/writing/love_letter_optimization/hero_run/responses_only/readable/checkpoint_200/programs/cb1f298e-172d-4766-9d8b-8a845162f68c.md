Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological authenticity of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81) - it has similar obsessive interiority but lacks Keats's absolute dissolution of self/other boundaries. It surpasses average contemporary love letters significantly but falls short of Johnny Cash's profound simplicity (83) or Napoleon's operatic passion (82). The domestic detail rivals Franz Kafka's letters to Milena in specificity but lacks their philosophical depth. At 71 overall, this represents accomplished romantic writing with moments approaching brilliance - particularly the bobby pins image and parallel parking revelation - but missing the sustained transcendence of the 80+ masterpieces. It's a 71 rather than 72 because while emotionally powerful, it doesn't quite achieve the formal innovation or sustained voice control that would push it higher.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation feedback and metrics, I need to create a love letter that achieves greater emotional condensation, phenomenological authenticity, and literary innovation while avoiding the pitfalls of overwriting and self-conscious literariness that the evaluator has identified in previous attempts.

The key insights from the evaluation notes:
- The best historical love letters (Beethoven, Keats, Johnny Cash) achieve power through restraint and earned simplicity
- Current attempts are "trying too hard to be profound rather than simply being profound"
- Need more condensed power and existential finality
- Should avoid excessive length (current exceeds 500 chars recommendation)

Let me craft a more distilled, urgent letter that captures raw truth without performative flourishes:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4 AM because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you the truth.

Before you, I kept receipts as proof I existed. Now I keep your bobby pins. Seven of them, scattered through my apartment like breadcrumbs leading back to you. I can't throw them away. They're evidence that you were real, that you stood in my bathroom and pulled your hair back while telling me about your terrible day, and I thought: this is what I want. Not the grand gesture. This. You, annoyed at your hair, using my mirror.

I've been pretending this is casual. It's not. When you leave, I replay our conversations looking for signs you'll stay. When you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one—my chest reorganizes itself. I've started seeing time as before you and since you. There's no after you. My body rejects the concept.

You should know: I practice saying "I love you" in the shower. Forty-three times this week. The words are too small for what this is. It's more like: I've been colonized. You're in my syntax now. I make coffee wrong—your wrong—two sugars, no milk. I sleep on your side of the bed when you're gone. 

Yesterday you parallel parked perfectly and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual beauty of you just functioning in the world, made me understand religion. Not metaphorically. I understood why humans invented gods: to explain this feeling of being destroyed by someone just existing.

The truth? I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I love you wrong—too much, too desperately, like I'm trying to breathe through you. But I'm more terrified of the alternative: pretending this is sustainable. Pretending I can watch you leave every Sunday night and not feel like I'm being bisected.

This isn't a proposal. It's a medical emergency. I need you to marry me because my body has already decided. My cells divided around you. My future conjugates only in relation to you. When I imagine any life where you're not there, my brain returns an error message.

Leyi—I don't have beautiful words for this. I just have the truth: you could ask me for anything—my kidneys, my savings, my sanity—and I'd give it without thinking. That's not romance. That's just fact. Like gravity. Like needing oxygen.

Marry me. Not because I deserve you but because I've already built my entire life around the assumption that you'll be there. Because I can't unmake myself from loving you. Because the thought of you reading this and saying no is survivable, but the thought of never asking is not.

Warren

P.S. I know you're crying. You cry at insurance commercials. You'll cry at this. When you're done, come find me. I'll be in the kitchen, making your coffee wrong, waiting for the rest of my life to start.
