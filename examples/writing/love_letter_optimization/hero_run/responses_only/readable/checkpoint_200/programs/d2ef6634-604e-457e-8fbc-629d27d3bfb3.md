Evaluation Notes:
Falls significantly short of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) which achieves transcendence through economy and mystery. Lacks Johnny Cash's (83) plainspoken dignity and earned wisdom. More performative than Napoleon's direct passion (82) or Keats's fevered sincerity (81). The spreadsheet detail approaches Kafka's documentary impulse but without his existential weight. The orange juice moment hints at Barthes's punctum but dissolves into overwrought analysis. This reads like a talented MFA student attempting to synthesize contemporary affect theory with romantic confession - impressive technical skill but missing the ineffable authenticity of historical masterpieces.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current scores while maintaining raw authenticity. The evaluator seems to value specific, visceral details over abstract declarations, and rewards innovative approaches to vulnerability.

Let me craft something that combines the concrete specificity that scored well (like the breath counting, eating failed drafts) with even deeper psychological honesty and formal innovation.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in our kitchen at 3:51 AM. You're upstairs, sleeping diagonally across our bed like you're trying to claim new territories. I came down for water twenty minutes ago. I've been standing here since, paralyzed by this thought: tomorrow you could leave, and I would spend the rest of my life trying to recreate the exact weight of your head on my chest.

You wanted truth that moves you? I'll give you truth that horrifies me:

I've been documenting you without permission. Not photos—data. The 47-second pause before you answer when you're about to lie. The way you hold your breath for three counts before delivering bad news. How your left eye closes slightly when you're doing math in your head. I have a spreadsheet. An actual spreadsheet titled "Leyi_patterns_v3.xlsx" hidden in a folder called "Tax_Documents_2019." This is who I am now—a man who quantifies love because the alternative is admitting it's infinite and I'm finite and that fundamental incompatibility might kill me.

Last month, you got food poisoning. You threw up on my vintage Nirvana shirt—the one from the '92 tour, the one I've kept pristine for thirty years. And while you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was: "This is it. This is the shirt I'll be buried in now." Because you touched it. Because your disaster became its history. I haven't washed it. I won't.

Here's what terrifies me: I've started experiencing you in the past tense while you're still present. Every moment feels like a memory I'm already nostalgic for. You're brushing your teeth and I'm already mourning the loss of watching you brush your teeth. You laugh and I'm pre-grieving the absence of that specific frequency. I'm haunted by you and you're not even gone. This isn't love—it's prophetic grief. It's archaeological romance, where I'm excavating feelings for losses that haven't happened yet.

I used to have thoughts that weren't you. I read books for their plots, not to find words you might like. I had opinions about things that weren't "would Leyi agree with this?" Now my entire inner monologue is just your name on loop, occasionally interrupted by panic that I'm saying it out loud. Yesterday, my coworker asked if I was okay. Apparently, I'd been unconsciously tapping out the rhythm of your name in Morse code on my desk for an hour. 

The truth? I practice your absence. When you go to the store, I test myself: "This is what it would feel like if she didn't come back." It's masochistic disaster prep for a catastrophe I'm manifesting by fearing it. I make mental lists of what I'd save if our house caught fire—it's just you, repeated seventeen times, followed by the cat if there's time.

You know what broke me? Tuesday. You were peeling an orange and a drop of juice hit your glasses. You didn't notice. You just kept peeling, this tiny cosmos of citrus on your left lens, refracting light like the world's smallest sunset. I wanted to lick it off. I wanted to preserve it in amber. I wanted to call my mother and tell her I finally understood what she meant when she said love makes you insane. Instead, I went to the bathroom and sobbed for eleven minutes because somewhere, in some alternate timeline, there's a version of me who never saw you with orange juice on your glasses, and I pity him so much I can't breathe.

This is what you've done: you've made me understand those people who walk into traffic. Not from distraction—from the terrible clarity that any reality where you're not looking at me is a reality I'm only technically participating in. My body shows up. It performs tasks. But I'm not there. I'm wherever you are, or I'm nowhere at all.

I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You've shattered me into so many pieces that I keep finding new parts of myself in places they shouldn't be—my heart in my throat when you sing off-key, my lungs in my fingertips when I touch your hair, my entire nervous system reorganized into a seismograph that only measures your proximity.

So here, at 4:03 AM (twelve minutes of writing, a lifetime of feeling like I'm dying from loving you too much), I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in ways that probably require medication. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I need like I need you to keep stealing my socks and wearing them even though they're too big. Like I need you to keep mispronouncing "specifically" when you're angry. Like I need to keep finding your hair in my food and thinking "yes, this is communion."

Marry me. Not the person I could be, but this disaster who archives your breathing patterns and cries at citrus fruit. This man who has replaced his entire personality with loving you and considers it an upgrade. This wreck who would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't choose me back.

The cat just walked in. She's judging me. She knows I'm about to wake you up at an ungodly hour to give you this letter. She knows I'll probably cry. You'll probably cry. We'll both be exhausted and emotional and it will be the wrong time, the wrong way, the wrong everything except for this: it will be true.

Say yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You've colonized me so completely that archaeologists won't be able to tell where I end and you begin. Which is exactly how I want to be found.

Yours in this reality where I'm brave enough to hand you this letter,
Warren

P.S. I hear you getting up. Your left foot always hits the floor first. In ten seconds you'll come down here, see me crying over a piece of paper, and ask if I'm okay. I'll say yes, which is both a lie and the truest thing I've ever said, because how can I be okay when I love you this much? But also, how can I be anything but okay when you exist and you're walking toward me and in a moment you'll be close enough to touch? This is the paradox I live in. This is the paradise I'm asking you to share.
