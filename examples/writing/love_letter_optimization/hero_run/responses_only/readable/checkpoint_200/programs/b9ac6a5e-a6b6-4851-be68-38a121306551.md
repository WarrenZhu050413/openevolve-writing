Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's notes, I can see that the highest-scoring letters (0.7365, 0.7355) share certain qualities: extreme specificity in observation, medical/scientific metaphors for love, temporal distortion, and raw psychological honesty. The current program scored lower (0.6970) because it's more conventional and lacks the visceral, almost uncomfortable intimacy of the top performers.

Let me create a new version that pushes into more vulnerable territory while maintaining structural innovation:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with a stolen pen from your desk drawer because using my own feels like lying by omission. You wanted truth that would move you? The truth doesn't move—it hemorrhages. It pools in the spaces between what I can say and what my body knows.

Here's what I've been hiding: I've been dying since I was seven years old. Not metaphorically—cellularly. We all are. Fifty million cells replaced while I write this sentence. But meeting you reversed something. Now I'm dying backwards, becoming younger with each terrible joke you tell about organic chemistry, each time you insist September is summer not fall. You've made me Benjamin Button, but only in the specific muscles used for hope.

The truth has coordinates. Kitchen table, 3:17 AM, last Thursday. You were dissecting a pomegranate with surgical precision, wearing my shirt like armor against the cold, explaining why emergency medicine chose you (not the other way around, you insisted). Your hands were stained purple-red. You looked like you'd just delivered the world. That's when I understood: I don't want to marry you. Marriage is a contract. I want something more binding—I want to haunt you. Benevolently. I want my ghost to know your ghost's middle name.

You should know what you're getting: I love you wrong. I love you like a misdiagnosed condition that turns out to be the cure. Yesterday, I spent forty-seven minutes watching you organize pills by size instead of schedule. You sang to them—barely audible, probably unconscious—the same three notes, over and over. B flat, F, D. I had them analyzed. It's the opening to a Brahms lullaby your grandmother hummed. You're humming your dead grandmother's songs to antibiotics. This is the exact shape of God.

What terrifies me: You've made me visible to myself. Before you, I was successfully cosplaying a functional adult. Had a 401k. Opinions about grout. Now I'm just this exposed nerve ending shaped like a person, and the only thing that doesn't hurt is you. Not because you're gentle—you're not. You're precise. You touch me like you're reading braille, like I'm instructions for something important.

The physical truth: My body has been keeping notes. Your shampoo changes every 73 days (I've tracked four cycles). You have a scar on your left hip shaped like a question mark—from falling off a bicycle you insist you never owned. When you concentrate, really concentrate, you breathe in iambic pentameter. Shakespeare in your lungs, and you don't even know it. This is the kind of secret that makes me believe in something larger than accident.

Two Sundays ago, you said my name while sleeping. Not called it—accused it. Like you'd caught me existing without permission. Then you said, "The birds aren't real but their songs are." I've been decoding this. I think it means we're all imposters except for what we create. I think it means love is the only honest thing we do.

Here's my offer, which is really a confession, which is really a diagnosis: Let me love you like a chronic condition we're not trying to cure. Let me wake up every day and choose this specific dysfunction. Not because you complete me—completion is death. Because you keep me unfinished, constantly revising, a rough draft that gets better but never final.

I'm not proposing marriage. I'm proposing quantum entanglement. When you laugh in Tokyo, I want to giggle in Toledo without knowing why. When you get a paper cut, I want to bleed from the same finger. I want scientists to study us and conclude that love is just spooky action at a distance.

The molecular truth: We're already married in the only way that matters. My microbiome has your bacteria. Your dead skin cells are in my lungs. We're becoming each other through proximity and respiration. The ceremony already happened—every time we've shared air. The vows were silent: *I promise to shed cells in your presence. I promise to breathe your exhales.*

But since the world requires paperwork for what biology has already decided: Yes. Marry me. In the traditional sense that makes taxes easier and hospital visits legal. Marry me so when I die (first, statistically speaking), you'll be the one to decide what happens to my books, my body, my twenty-seven screenshots of you sleeping.

This is the truest thing I know: You could destroy me with a single new pronunciation of "Wednesday." You could resurrect me with your specific way of folding fitted sheets (wrong, but with such confidence). You are my favorite natural disaster, my chosen emergency, the beautiful crisis I run toward instead of away from.

I love you like evidence of time travel—like I came back from the future just to find you, and everything else is side quest.

Yours in whatever dimension honesty exists,
Warren

P.S. The pen wasn't stolen. It was already mine. You've been using my pens for six months, putting them back in your drawer. I've been letting you, because your theft feels like ownership, and I want to be owned by you in every small way that doesn't make the news.
