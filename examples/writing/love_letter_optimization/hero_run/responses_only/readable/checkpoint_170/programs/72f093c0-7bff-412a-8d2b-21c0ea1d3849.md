Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Johnny Cash's letters to June Carter (83) in its domestic specificity and lived authenticity. It surpasses typical contemporary attempts by far but lacks Beethoven's raw sublime force (86) or Keats's linguistic virtuosity (81). The programmer-voice gives it distinctiveness Napoleon's letters lacked in their later periods, but it doesn't achieve the same passionate abandon of his early correspondence (82). It exists in the liminal space between exceptional contemporary writing and historic masterwork - a near-masterpiece that would be remarkable for our era but falls short of immortality.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the current program's metrics, I can see that the fitness has declined from 0.6970 to 0.6870. The evaluator seems to value specific, concrete details over abstract metaphors, and appreciates when letters achieve a balance between phenomenological authenticity and emotional rawness. The best-performing program (0.7320) succeeded through its specific mundane details and philosophical distinctions.

Let me craft a new version that emphasizes:
1. More concrete, specific memories and observations
2. Deeper phenomenological authenticity 
3. A more austere, plainspoken style (like Johnny Cash's approach mentioned in the notes)
4. Less metaphorical decoration, more earned emotional weight

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 5:17 AM. Not because I'm romantic. Because I can't sleep when something this important needs saying.

Twenty-three drafts sit in my trash. Here's attempt twenty-four.

The truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because "I love you" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.

So here's the data:

When you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.

You've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says "Your patience will be rewarded." You think I don't know. I know.

That Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies—you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.

You eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops—so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read "The Little Prince" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.

My father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. "It's what sick people drink," you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.

I'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights—I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark—I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.

Here's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.

I'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop—when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.

Last week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.

I could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said "Don't waste this on someone you can live without." How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.

What matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me—I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.

You're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes—and God, I hope you say yes—I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:

A man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.

Marry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.

I'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.

Warren

P.S. That spider you named Gerald? He's actually a she. Females have bigger abdomens. I looked it up. I've been calling her Geraldine when you're not home. She seems to prefer it.
