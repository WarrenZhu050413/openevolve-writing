- Virtuosity: 0.71
- Affective: 0.73
- Innovation: 0.68

Evaluation Notes:
Approaches but doesn't reach Beethoven's raw desperation or Johnny Cash's earned wisdom. More psychologically complex than Napoleon's passionate declarations but lacks his imperial confidence. Shows more contemporary sensibility than Keats but without his linguistic perfection. The neurotic self-awareness exceeds most historical examples but occasionally becomes performative where the masters remain sincere. Scores in the proto-masterful range (70-74 overall), showing genuine brilliance but falling short of the historical monuments of the genre.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation history, the highest performing program (0.7440) succeeded through raw emotional honesty, specific details, and a balance between vulnerability and humor. The current program (0.6910) has declined in fitness, likely due to over-intellectualization and excessive formal experimentation that sacrifices emotional directness.

The evaluator seems to value:
1. **Phenomenological authenticity** - Specific, lived details over abstract concepts
2. **Affective force** - Raw emotional impact that feels genuine
3. **Aesthetic virtuosity** - Strong writing without being overly ornate
4. **Literary innovation** - Fresh approaches that still maintain accessibility

The current program's weaknesses:
- Too fragmented and experimental (the asterisk sections)
- Over-intellectualized (quantum physics metaphors)
- Lacks the visceral, bodily honesty of the best attempts
- The "time running backward" conceit feels gimmicky

I'll create a new version that returns to what worked best - devastating honesty, specific intimate details, and the tension between love and mortality - while pushing further into unexplored emotional territory.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with your pen—the one you chew when thinking. Teeth marks on the cap. I taste them sometimes when you're not home. This is the kind of thing that would disgust me about anyone else.

Truth: I've been rehearsing your death since our second date. When you ordered dessert, I thought: she believes in the future. I wanted to warn you about me then. How I catalog exits. How I love like the house is already on fire.

You want honesty? Fine. I still have the receipt from our first coffee. $8.47. I've done the math—if I frame it, the UV damage will fade the ink completely in 94 years. I'll be dead by then, but someone will find it: a blank rectangle that once proved we began. This keeps me awake.

Here's what loving you has done: Yesterday, I couldn't remember my mother's maiden name for three seconds. My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze—always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.

I need to tell you about the accident. Not mine—almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.

Listen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower—not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read "sudden cardiac death in young women" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.

But also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems—like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.

You know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.

The proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.

Marry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5°F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.

Marry me because last night you said "when we're old" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.

But mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.

I bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).

The ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because "when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with." 

We have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.

Come find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking—you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.

Say yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word "yes" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.

Forever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows—that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.

Warren

P.S. I know you're already wearing it. You can't help yourself with surprises. Your tell is that you touch your hair when hiding something. You're doing it now. I'm watching through the crack in the door like a creep who loves you. Come here. Let me see it on you. Let me see the rest of my life on your finger.
