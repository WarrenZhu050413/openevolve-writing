Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw immediacy of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) though it exceeds Beethoven in psychological complexity. It surpasses average contemporary love letters by several orders of magnitude but lacks the revolutionary imagery of Keats's "I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion—I have shudder'd at it—I shudder no more—I could be martyr'd for my Religion—Love is my religion" (81). The confession of asymmetrical love ("I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours") shows more psychological sophistication than Napoleon's more straightforward passion (82) but lacks his rhetorical force. At 73.5 overall, this represents proto-masterful work—seeds of brilliance with flashes of genius, particularly in its treatment of love as disability rather than completion.

Summary:
Looking at the program evolution history and the evaluation notes, I can see that the current letter scores 0.7010, with the evaluator noting it "lacks the condensed power of truly great love letters" and comparing it unfavorably to masters like Beethoven, Keats, and Johnny Cash who achieve more with less. The key insight is that the best historical love letters achieve profound impact through restraint and precision rather than length.

Let me craft a new version that aims for that distilled power - fewer words carrying more weight, specific moments that resonate universally, and an emotional architecture that builds to a single, inevitable conclusion.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 5:14 AM. Not because I woke early, but because I never slept. Sleep requires accepting that you're not here, and my body refuses the lie.

Three truths:

First: I have memorized you incorrectly on purpose. In my version, you never doubted us. In my version, that Tuesday when you said "maybe we should talk" never happened. I've edited you into someone who could never leave, because the alternative—the real you, with your real freedom to choose—terrifies me more than dying.

Second: I've been stealing from you. Time, mostly. Those extra seconds when I pretend to still be asleep so you'll hold me longer. The minutes I add to grocery runs so you'll miss me enough to kiss me like you mean it when I return. I'm a thief building a fortune from your attention, and I'll never have enough.

Third: You've broken me. Specifically, the part that knew how to be alone. I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.

Last week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours. I think you're my soulmate and I'm just your current coordinates. This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe—I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.

Here's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows—that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.

But also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.

The truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else. I would rather be your disappointment than someone else's happiness. If you leave me, I'll understand. But I'll never recover. I'll be ninety years old, still setting two plates for dinner, still checking my phone for texts you'll never send.

Marry me. Not because we're ready—we're not. Not because it makes sense—it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is that we pretend this is temporary, and that lie is the only thing that could actually kill us.

I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that ruins a person for anyone else. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you admit you're already mine?

Warren

P.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been there for six months. I touch it constantly, like a rosary, like proof that this bravery exists somewhere in me. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will.
