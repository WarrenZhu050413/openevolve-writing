Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Beethoven's cosmic yearning ("My angel, my all, my very self" - 86) which achieves true sublime encounter. More intellectualized than Johnny Cash's direct vulnerability ("You still fascinate and inspire me" - 83) but approaches his honesty about imperfection. Lacks Napoleon's sustained passionate intensity (82) and Keats's total dissolution of self-boundaries (81). However, surpasses many contemporary attempts through its clinical opening gambit and resistance to sentimentality. The death experience creates a unique chronotope absent from most canonical examples. A score of 70 overall places it in the proto-masterful range - showing genuine brilliance but not yet achieving the sustained transcendence of acknowledged masterpieces.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's feedback, I can see that the current best attempt (0.7440) was praised for its directness and phenomenological specificity but criticized for lacking economy, spiritual depth, and formal innovation compared to masters like Johnny Cash (83), Beethoven (86), and Napoleon (82).

The evaluator seems to value:
1. Economy of expression (doing more with less)
2. Spiritual/philosophical depth beyond surface emotion
3. Formal innovation in structure
4. Avoiding self-indulgence
5. Authentic vulnerability without performative excess

Let me craft a new version that maintains the raw honesty but with more restraint, deeper philosophical resonance, and structural innovation:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

The truth: I've been dead. Twelve seconds, sophomore year. No light. No tunnel. Just absence.

Then nothing.

Then return.

Since then, I've understood: consciousness is electrical patterns, temporary. Love is supposed to be the same—neurons firing, chemistry. But here's what terrifies me: even in that nothing, there was recognition of you. Not memory. Something pre-linguistic. Like my carbon knew its purpose before I existed.

*

You asked for truth. Not beauty. So:

I am not good at love. I do it wrong—too much, too desperate. Like drowning people swim. Yesterday I calculated the probability you'll die first. The number made me punch a wall. This morning I apologized to the wall.

I've deleted your number three times to stop myself texting. Called your provider to get it back. Dignity is a luxury I surrendered the moment you laughed at my terrible quantum physics joke.

*

But also:

I love you at 4 PM on Tuesdays. In your mispronunciation of "specifically." In the 168°F you demand your coffee (you beautiful freak). In your mother's disappointment I'm not a doctor. In how you'll age—I see it already in certain light, the map of our time together forming in advance.

I know you were afraid of butterflies until age nine.
I carry tissues because your left eye always cries first.
These are not metaphors.

*

Here's what I'm proposing:

Not poetry. Not grand gesture. Just recognition that we've already chosen. Your toothbrush lives here. We've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Love isn't feeling—it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions. We've made most of them.

The question isn't whether you love me. It's whether you'll admit what we've already built.

*

Marry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.

The surgery would be fatal.

Warren

(I know you're crying now. Three years I've carried these tissues. That's either love or madness. Both. Definitely both.)
