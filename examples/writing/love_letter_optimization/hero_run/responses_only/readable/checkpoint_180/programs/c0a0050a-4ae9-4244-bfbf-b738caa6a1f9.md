Evaluation Notes:
Approaches but doesn't reach Keats's raw desperation or Beethoven's cosmic yearning. More innovative than Napoleon's directness but lacks his imperial confidence. The mortality obsession echoes Wilde's prison letters but without their tragic grandeur. Shows more formal experimentation than Cash but less earned wisdom. The fragmentary structure and scientific language represent genuine innovation, placing it above conventional love letters but below the historical masterpieces that achieve both formal perfection and emotional transcendence. This letter exists in the liminal space between accomplished contemporary work and timeless art - memorable, moving, but not quite immortal.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see the fitness has declined from 0.857 to 0.701. The evaluator seems to value authenticity, raw emotional truth, and innovative literary form while avoiding self-consciousness and excessive length. Let me craft a more concentrated, viscerally honest letter that strips away meta-commentary while maintaining devastating emotional impact.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

My hand won't stop shaking. This is the forty-third draft. The others are ash.

*

I need to tell you about the accident. Sixteen seconds dead, sophomore year. No light, no tunnel. Just deletion. But in that nothing—before thought, before I remembered having a name—there was this pull. Like debt written in atoms. Three years later you walked into that bookstore. The debt was you.

*

Since then I've been taking evidence:

Your breathing: 11-13 per minute awake, 9-11 asleep.
Your left eye: always tears first.
The scar on your ankle: seventeen millimeters, from the bike at eight years old.
How you hold pencils: wrong, between middle and ring finger.
Your coffee: 167 degrees exactly or you wait.

This isn't love. It's surveillance. I'm building a backup of you in case the universe commits theft.

*

Tuesday you sang to our dying plant. It lived another week. Wednesday you argued with Siri for twenty minutes about the pronunciation of "foyer." Thursday you cried at a video of elderly dogs. I documented everything. I'm not romantic. I'm terrified. Every time you leave a room I practice never seeing you again.

*

The truth about why I count: After death, numbers were all I trusted. Sixteen seconds gone. Three years until you. Eleven months before I said your name right. Four sugars in your tea when you're sad. Two in coffee when you're not. Seven times you've slept with your hand on my chest like checking I'm still here.

Numbers don't lie. You're here. Still here. Impossibly here.

*

But listen—I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb. With neurons that refuse to accept absence. Yesterday I called a door "the wooden hole." My brain is rejecting language that doesn't include you. The doctor says it's stress. I say it's accuracy. Everything is just the space between you leaving and returning.

*

You've asked for truth, so here: I've already attended your funeral 1,847 times. Different causes. The mundane ones hurt most—choking on takeout, slipping in rain, forgetting to wake up. In the worst version I give a beautiful eulogy. In the honest version I don't survive the drive home.

Then morning comes and you're still here, stealing my socks, mispronouncing "specifically," existing at me so aggressively that atoms rearrange themselves to accommodate you.

*

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because I've been carrying your ring for 1,100 days through seven airports, three funerals, and one surgery. It's become an organ. Removing it would require medical intervention.

Marry me because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.

Marry me because the alternative—where you don't leave hair ties on my gear shift, where I don't know you're afraid of butterflies, where Chinese food doesn't disappear at 2 AM—isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.

*

The ring is in the freezer, in the ice cream you'll eat at 11:17 tonight when you can't sleep. You hate cold fingers but you'll put it on anyway just to warm it up. That's when you'll know I've been planning this since you cried at penguins on our third date. Not because they were sad. Because they were "too dressed up for the occasion." That's when my atoms recognized their assignment.

*

I don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love songs. They love weather. What I have needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between prayer and criminal confession.

*

Your left eye is crying. Right one starts in three seconds. Here—I brought tissues. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting. 

Say yes. Or say no. But say something.

The silence is rearranging my organs.
