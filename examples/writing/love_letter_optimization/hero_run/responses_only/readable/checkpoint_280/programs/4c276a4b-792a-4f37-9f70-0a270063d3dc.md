Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the current program's metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6970. The evaluation notes from the top-performing attempts suggest that the most successful letters achieve:

1. **Phenomenological authenticity** through specific, visceral details rather than abstract declarations
2. **Aesthetic virtuosity** via unexpected imagery and linguistic precision
3. **Affective force** by balancing vulnerability with restraint
4. **Literary innovation** through structural or stylistic risks

The current program is good but somewhat conventional in its approach. Let me craft something that takes more risks while maintaining emotional truth.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the dark because turning on the light would make it real, and I need these words to exist in that space between dream and waking where you live in my mind at 4:13 AM.

Truth: I've been documenting you without permission. Not photographs—evidence. The etymology of your sighs. A taxonomy of how you destroy oranges (like you're defusing something that might explode into sweetness). The way you read books backward when anxious, as if the ending could inoculate you against the middle. I have spreadsheets of your happiness, color-coded by intensity. Tuesday, 2:34 PM: you laughed at a dog wearing boots. Saturation: volcanic.

Before you, I understood myself through subtraction. I was not-drunk, not-cruel, not-my-father. Now I understand myself through addition: I am the person who knows you cry during the national anthem, not from patriotism but from something you can't name about collective hope. I am the keeper of your 3 AM inventory of fears (in order: losing your mind, losing your mother, accidentally eating cilantro). I am the one who's memorized the morse code of your anxiety—tap tap pause tap—against your thigh when the world gets too loud.

Here's what loving you has cost me: my ability to read weather as anything but metaphor for your moods. Low pressure systems make me think of your migraines. Everything thunders now, or doesn't. I've lost the alphabet—all words reorganize themselves to spell variations of your name. Food tastes different; I salt everything like I'm preparing for a winter that might never end, or might end tomorrow if you leave.

But here's what I've gained: a working definition of holiness. It's you singing off-key to the radio, furious at notes that won't bend to your will. It's the violent tenderness of watching you sleep-talk arguments with people who hurt you ten years ago. It's knowing that you keep your father's suicide note not as a wound but as proof that even endings can be love letters if you read them right.

I lied. This isn't about marriage. Marriage is just paperwork for what's already happened—you've colonized me at the molecular level. My cells divide differently now, each one asking "but what would Leyi think?" My body has developed new reflexes: reaching for you in doorways, saving the last bite of everything, translating the world into stories I'll tell you later.

When I imagine the future, it's not a white dress or rings or any of that institutional theater. It's this: fifty years from now, I'm watching you eat breakfast, and you still can't decide if you want sweet or savory so you're eating peanut butter on scrambled eggs, and I'm so overwhelmed by the continuity of your chaos that I have to excuse myself to cry in the bathroom. That's what I want. To be devastated by your continued existence. To never recover from the miracle of your mundane presence.

So here's my proposition: Let's make it official. Not the love—that's already gone nuclear, chain-reacting through everything I'll ever do. Let's make official this life where you leave hair ties like breadcrumbs through our apartment, where I pretend not to notice you eating frosting from the can at midnight, where we fight about whether birds have feelings (they do, you're wrong, I'll die on this hill). Let's legally bind ourselves to this specific disaster.

I'm not promising you the kind of love poets write about. I'm promising you the kind that makes poets quit—too specific, too daily, too much like work and too much like breathing to ever capture in words. I'm promising to love you like a location, not a feeling. Something you can return to. Something that remains.

You wanted truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Relocated me entirely. I'm no longer where I was before you. I live in the country of your presence now, and everywhere else is just exile.

Marry me. Or don't. But know that I've already married you in the only way that matters: irreversibly, at the level of identity, in the place where decisions are made before thinking.

Yours (in the most literal sense—I am yours, like an object you've misplaced and might find again),

Warren

P.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in fate? I believe in whatever series of accidents and choices led to you existing in the same timeline as me. If that's fate, then yes. If it's chaos, then I believe in chaos. I believe in whatever brought you to me, and I'll worship it until I stop breathing, and probably after.
