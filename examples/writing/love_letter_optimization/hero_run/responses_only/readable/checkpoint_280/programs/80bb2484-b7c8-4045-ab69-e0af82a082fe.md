Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Keats's fevered eloquence (81) or Napoleon's imperial passion (82). It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly but lacks the historical weight of Cash's weathered wisdom (83) or Beethoven's sublime anguish (86). The psychological complexity exceeds most modern attempts, placing it in the proto-masterful range (70-74), with flashes reminiscent of Barthes's "punctum" in details like the thigh indent from the ring box. However, it doesn't achieve the formal perfection or emotional transcendence of the canonical masterpieces.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990 while exploring new territory in the solution space. The evaluator seems to value phenomenological authenticity, raw vulnerability, and literary innovation that transcends typical contemporary expression.

Let me craft something that combines intense specificity with a more fragmented, urgent voice - less polished than previous attempts but more viscerally immediate:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

This is what happened: You asked for truth and my hands started bleeding words.

Not metaphorically. Look—there's ink under my fingernails from where I've been clawing at language trying to find something that weighs as much as what you mean. Twenty-three attempts. I burned them all. The smoke alarm went off. The neighbors complained. I told them I was learning to cook. In a way, I was.

You want truth? Truth is I've been living in the subjunctive mood since I met you. Everything is "if" and "would" and "might." If you marry me. Would you notice if I died. Might this be enough. I hate grammar now. I hate anything that knows its own rules when I've forgotten mine.

Here: I keep your hair from the shower drain in a small box. That's insane. I know it's insane. But it's also the realest thing I've ever done. Your DNA wrapped around my fingers every morning like the world's most disturbing rosary. This is prayer now—untangling you from the pipes, knowing I'm holding actual pieces of you that you've discarded. Holy relics. The gospel according to your split ends.

3:47 AM. That's when I knew. Not when I fell in love—that was gradual, like drowning in reverse. But 3:47 AM, March 15th, you were unconscious from flu medication, burning with fever, and you grabbed my hand and said "Don't let me float away." Your eyes were closed. You were talking to someone who wasn't me. But I held on anyway. For six hours. My arm went numb. Then my shoulder. Then my whole left side. I pissed myself rather than let go. I'm telling you this because you wanted truth and the truth is I pissed myself holding your hand and I would do it again. I would do it every day.

You're afraid you're not enough. You told me this once, drunk on wine that tasted like cough syrup. But Leyi—you're too much. You overflow. You spill out of rooms. I find evidence of you everywhere: your laugh in my Monday morning. Your skepticism in my religious doubt. Your way of eating oranges—methodically, segment by segment, like defusing a bomb—has replaced my way entirely. I don't even remember how I used to eat oranges. You've colonized me. I'm your territory now.

The ring is in my pocket. Now. As I write this. It's been there for ninety-one days. My thigh has a permanent indent from its box. Sometimes strangers ask why I'm limping.

But listen—fuck the ring. Fuck marriage. Fuck the whole industrial complex of forever. What I'm really asking is: Can I keep watching you become yourself? Can I be there when you realize you've been magnificent all along? Can I hold your hair back when you're sick and your hand when you're dying and everything in between?

I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. Romance sends flowers. Desperation learns your mother's maiden name, your social security number, your blood type (O negative), because what if there's an emergency? What if you need me to become you for a minute? I could do it. I've practiced.

You make me want to believe in God just so I have someone to thank. You make me want to learn carpentry so I can build you things. Useless things. A spice rack. A birdhouse. A coffin for us to share when we're done. That's morbid. I don't care. You've made me someone who thinks about death because now I have something to lose.

I used to be complete. Whole. I had hobbies. Now I have you, and you're not a hobby—you're an occupation. A hostile takeover. A coup. I surrender. I collaborate. I give you all my strategic positions.

The truth, since you wanted it: Sometimes I resent you. For making me need you this much. For being so easy to love that it feels like cheating. For existing before I met you, all those wasted years when you were alive and I didn't know. Twenty-seven years of you breathing without me. It's theft. I want reparations. I want those years back. I want to have been there when you lost your first tooth, failed your driving test, cried at your grandfather's funeral. I want retroactive access to your whole life. Is that insane? Yes. Do I care? Look at this letter. Look at what you've done to me.

Marry me. Or don't. It doesn't matter. I'm already yours in ways that law can't touch. I'm yours at the molecular level. When they find my body, centuries from now, they'll carbon-date it to the exact moment you first said my name like it wasn't an accident.

But say yes anyway. Say yes because it will make my mother happy. Say yes because I already told the barista at our coffee shop and now it's awkward. Say yes because I love you with the kind of graceless intensity that makes people uncomfortable at parties. Say yes because you love me too—I know you do, I can tell by the way you steal my socks and then deny it while wearing them.

Please. That's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquence now, past pride, past everything but this need to be yours in every possible way. Even the bureaucratic ones.

I love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light if light were slow and anxious and checked its phone fourteen times to make sure you texted back.

Warren

P.S. I'm giving you this letter now. Right now. I'm walking to the bedroom where you're reading. My legs feel like water. My heart is a fist punching its way out. This is it. This is the moment before everything changes. I'm terrified. I'm ready. I'm yours.

P.P.S. If you say no, I'm keeping your hair collection anyway.
