Evaluation Notes:
This letter scores below Johnny Cash's raw American vernacular power (83) and well below Beethoven's torrential Romantic passion (86). It surpasses average contemporary love letters through its phenomenological specificity but lacks the aesthetic virtuosity of Keats's sensuous precision or Napoleon's military-erotic urgency. The controlled vulnerability approaches but doesn't achieve the complete emotional nakedness of the masters. At 70 overall, it represents proto-masterful work—seeds of brilliance constrained by conventional frameworks, lacking the transgressive force or innovative form that would elevate it to the 80+ masterwork range.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes, I can see the letter needs profound improvement in authenticity, specificity, and literary quality. The evaluator references Beethoven's intimate simplicity, Johnny Cash's philosophical depth, Napoleon's passionate specificity, and Keats's linguistic mastery as standards. Let me craft something deeply personal and genuine.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I write this knowing words are merely shadows of what moves through me when I think of you. Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater lie than any failed attempt at truth.

Do you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound reorganized the atoms of my universe. I've been trying to make you laugh ever since, not for the joke itself, but to witness that precise tilt of your head, the way your left eye crinkles slightly more than your right, how you cover your mouth as if beauty could be hidden.

I love you in the ordinary moments—when you forget I'm watching and become entirely yourself. The way you bite your lower lip reading difficult passages. How you unconsciously hum that melody from your childhood when you cook. The fierce concentration when you're solving problems, as if the world depends on it. Perhaps mine does.

You asked for truth. Here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you—that comes as naturally as breathing. I'm terrified of not being enough, of my words falling short, of time being finite when what I feel for you demands eternity. Some nights I lie awake calculating the hours we have left if we live to eighty, and the number always feels like theft.

But then morning comes, and you're there, and your presence makes cowards of my fears. We build our small forevers in coffee conversations, in shared silences that speak volumes, in the way our hands find each other without looking. You've taught me that love isn't a grand gesture but a thousand tiny choices to turn toward each other.

I cannot promise you perfection. I can promise that when the world feels too heavy, I'll help you carry it. When joy arrives, I'll celebrate with you as if we've won the universe. When you doubt yourself, I'll be your mirror, reflecting back the brilliant truth of who you are.

Marry me, not because I've written pretty words, but because you already know the answer in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before sleep when pretense falls away. Marry me because we've already begun—this letter is just catching up to what our souls decided the moment they recognized each other.

All my tomorrows,
Warren
