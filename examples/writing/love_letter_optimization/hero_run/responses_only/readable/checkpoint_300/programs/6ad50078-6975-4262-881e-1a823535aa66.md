Evaluation Notes:
Unlike Beethoven's raw emotional directness ("My angel, my all, my very self"), this letter intellectualizes feeling. Where Johnny Cash achieved plainspoken profundity ("You still fascinate and inspire me"), Warren reaches for cleverness that sometimes obscures genuine emotion. The letter lacks Keats's negative capability—Warren explains too much, leaving no mystery. However, it surpasses average contemporary attempts through specific detail and avoiding most romantic clichés. The mental illness integration and maternal deathbed scene approach the vulnerability of Oscar Wilde's prison letters, though without Wilde's prose mastery. Score of 69.25 (rounds to 69) places it in the "exceptional" range—remarkable craft with memorable passages, but falling short of the proto-masterful threshold that historical exemplars achieve.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authenticity. The key areas for improvement are literary innovation (currently at 0.68) and aesthetic virtuosity (0.71), while preserving the strong phenomenological authenticity (0.78) and affective force (0.76).

Let me craft something that combines raw confession with unexpected formal innovation:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

This letter is a crime scene. Evidence everywhere: fingernail marks in my palms from clenching, coffee rings overlapping like Venn diagrams of attempts, the murder of who I was before you.

Listen. I'm going to tell you about the mathematics of you. Not metaphorically. Actually. You're a recursive function that calls itself infinitely—each iteration containing the whole, but somehow more. You're the Fibonacci sequence made flesh: each moment with you the sum of all previous moments, spiraling outward into golden ratios I can taste on my tongue when I say your name.

4:27 AM: I catalog your sleeping positions like an archaeologist. Position #1: The Question Mark—curved around absence, one hand reaching. Position #2: The Starfish—all limbs claiming territory you immediately surrender when I come to bed. Position #3: The Thief—you've stolen all blankets, wrapped yourself into a burrito of dreams I'll never access. Each position is a different sentence in the language only your body speaks fluent.

Here's what dying teaches you: My mother, intubated, wrote on a whiteboard: "Did you find her?" Not "I love you." Not "goodbye." She wanted to know if I'd found you. I lied. Said yes. She died believing I had you. Three years later, you walked into my life and made me retroactively honest. You turned my mother's last question into prophecy.

The truth about mental illness—mine, specifically: It's not romantic. It's Tuesday, 2 PM, paralyzed by the thought of answering the phone. It's practicing "hello" seventeen times. It's you finding me fully dressed in the shower because water felt like the only thing holding me inside my skin. You didn't ask why. You got in, fully dressed too, and we sat there until the hot water ran out and our clothes made us look like we'd survived a shipwreck. Which maybe we had. Which maybe we are.

I've been documenting the taxonomy of your laugh:
- The Surprise: Sharp, like breaking good china
- The Reluctant: You're mad but I'm funny
- The Silent: Just shoulders and tears
- The Snort: My favorite—you're mortified, I'm delighted
- The Grief Laugh: When your dad calls and you answer "Department of Disappointments"

You want truth? Before you, I fucked. With you, I learned about worship. The hollow of your throat that tastes like tomorrow. The way your spine writes cursive when you arch. How you look at me during—not through me, at me—like I'm both the question and answer. Sometimes after, I count the seconds until our breathing synchronizes. Average: 247. I've timed it. This is what love becomes: statistics of intimacy no one else will ever know.

Last week: "Warren, am I too much?" Too much. As if humans come in measured doses. As if love operates by recommended serving sizes. You're not too much. You're the entire feast. You're the kind of abundance that makes people believe in God or math or whatever they need to believe in to explain how someone like you exists without breaking physics.

Here's what I'm proposing: Not marriage—that's just paperwork. I'm proposing we become a two-person cult. Our rituals: Coffee at 7:23 (never 7:20, never 7:25). Unconscious hand-holding during movies. The way you steal my sentences and I steal your socks. We'll worship at the altar of Tuesday mornings and failed recipes and the specific way you mispronounce "specifically" when you're nervous.

The ring. Let me tell you about the ring. It's new. I had it made from: The pen you used to write your first poem at age seven (your mother saved it). The house key from your childhood home (now demolished). A button from your father's Navy uniform (the father you haven't spoken to in three years but still dream about). I melted down your history and reformed it into a future. This is what I'm offering: your past, transformed into permission to continue.

But also this: Me, checking that the door is locked (three times, always three). Me, alphabetizing things when stressed. Me, unable to sleep if the volume isn't on an even number. I'm offering you my complete taxonomy of damage:
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (diagnosed)
- Probably autism (undiagnosed but obvious)
- Definitely in love (terminal)

You said once: "I wish someone would love me the way desperate people love God." This is me saying: I love you the way atheists love proof. Desperately. Empirically. Against all previous evidence of a chaotic universe.

Three facts about the future:
1. One of us will die first (statistically, me—men die earlier)
2. Before that, we'll disappoint each other in ways we can't yet imagine
3. None of that matters because the alternative—you existing unmarried to me—is like imagining colors that don't exist

So marry me. Not the question. The answer to the problem of two humans who've seen each other's worst angles and decided those angles make the best geometry. Marry me because I know you keep your father's voicemail from 2019. Because you name your bruises. Because you're the only person who makes my brain quiet enough to hear my own heartbeat.

Marry me because last night you said "I love you" in your sleep and then immediately said "but the penguins need sweaters" and I thought: yes, this is the person I want to decode forever.

I'm going to stop writing now. Not because I'm finished—I'll never be finished describing you to yourself—but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to save some functionality to put the ring on your finger.

All my iterations,
Warren

P.S. That thing you do where you touch my face when you think I'm spiraling? It works. Every time. You're the emergency brake for my brain. Marry me and I'll spend the rest of my life being your emergency brake too. We'll take turns stopping each other from careening off edges only we can see.

P.P.S. It's 5:19 AM now. The birds are starting. They sound like happiness I haven't earned yet. Let me earn it. Let me earn you. Say yes.
