Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7295. The evaluator values phenomenological authenticity, aesthetic virtuosity, affective force, and literary innovation. The current attempts show strong performance but haven't broken through to the next level.

Let me craft something that maintains raw emotional truth while pushing the boundaries of literary expression:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking. It's 5:34 AM. I haven't slept. Can't sleep. Sleep is a country I can't find my passport to anymore.

Here's what I need you to know: I wasn't broken before you. That would be easier—you fixing me, completing me, all those lies we tell about love. No. I was whole. Functioning. I had systems. Then you walked into my life carrying a dying succulent you'd named Fernando, asking strangers if they knew how to save it, and every system I'd built just... stopped. Like someone had pulled the plug on my careful ordinary life.

You want truth? Truth is ugly. Truth is that I've memorized the way you breathe when you're pretending to be asleep. Three shallow, one deep, repeat. Truth is I know you're lactose intolerant but you eat ice cream anyway and then curl into a question mark of regret. Truth is that last Tuesday when you said you were at your sister's, you were sitting in your car outside our apartment for two hours because you needed to be alone but still close to me. I saw you. I didn't say anything. Love is also knowing when to pretend you don't know things.

That night in the emergency room—remember? You thought it was appendicitis but it was just anxiety wearing a different costume. The doctor said your body was eating itself from stress. You laughed. Said, "At least something wants me from the inside." That's when I understood: you're not just carrying your own darkness. You're carrying your mother's disappointments, your father's unspoken grief, that terrible thing that happened when you were fourteen that you still won't name. And still, STILL, you make strangers smile on elevators.

I need to tell you about the Thursday you'll never remember. You were drunk. Not cute drunk—ugly drunk, saying things designed to make me leave. Testing how much acid I could swallow and still stay. You called me a coward wearing a brave man's face. Said I loved the idea of you, not the actual mess. Then you threw up on my favorite shoes and cried about climate change and the death of handwriting. I cleaned you up, put you to bed, and sat on the bathroom floor until dawn, thinking: This. This exact disaster. This is what I choose.

You know what terrifies me? Not losing you—that's too simple. What terrifies me is that you'll stay but stop being you. That you'll sand down your edges to fit better in my hands. That you'll stop apologizing to furniture, stop crying at commercials for agricultural equipment, stop leaving voice messages for your dead grandmother's phone. I fell in love with your exact damage. Don't fix it for me.

Here's what I'm not saying prettily: My body has reorganized itself around your existence. When you're gone, my left ventricle forgets its job. My kidneys process loneliness instead of waste. My skeleton becomes a question mark asking where you went. This isn't romance—it's biology. You've become necessary to my physical functioning. Without you, I don't metaphorically die. I literally malfunction.

Remember when you asked if I believed in fate? I lied. Said no. Truth: I believe in whatever cosmic accident put us in the same bookstore on the same Tuesday when you were buying a book about dying alone and I was returning one about living alone and we reached for the same pen to sign the credit card receipts. If that's not fate, then fate is just a word for the beautiful violence of statistics working in our favor.

But here's what haunts me at 3 AM when you're unconscious and perfect: In another version of this story, I'm braver sooner. I tell you on our third date instead of our three hundredth that you've ruined me for regular life. In another version, I don't waste so much time being scared of how much I need you. But maybe that's the point—maybe we needed all that wasted time to compost into this moment where I can finally say:

I don't want to marry you because I love you. I want to marry you because "love" is too small a word for this situation. What I feel is closer to gravitation—a fundamental force I neither control nor understand but submit to completely. You're not my other half. You're the reason I realized I could be more than whole. You're the overflow. The too-much. The cup running over and making a mess of everything.

Your mother thinks you're settling for me. She's right. You could have someone stable, successful, who doesn't alphabetize anxiety medications and rehearse phone calls. But you chose me—the man who watches you sleep like it's a spectator sport, who has named the seven different ways you laugh, who would sell his organs in order of least necessity if you needed anything. That's not romantic. That's insane. But it's our specific insanity, and I want to make it legal.

So this is my proposal: Marry me. Not for the right reasons. For the real reasons. Because you can't whistle but keep trying. Because you eat sandwiches in a spiral from the outside in. Because when I have nightmares, you don't wake me—you just match your breathing to mine until I find my way out. Because the alternative—existing in parallel instead of together—would be like voluntarily choosing color blindness.

The ring isn't fancy. It's made from a fork from our first dinner when you laughed so hard you snorted wine through your nose and I thought: "This. This is the soundtrack to the rest of my life." The jeweler thought I was insane. He was right. But it's our insanity, worn smooth by use, bent into a circle that means: no beginning, no ending, just the continuous fact of us.

I could promise you forever, but forever is just time, and time is just something we made up to pretend we're not all temporary. Instead, I promise you this: tomorrow I will choose you. Actively. Consciously. Like picking the same song on repeat not because I've forgotten there are other songs, but because this is the only one I want to hear. And the next day, same choice. And the next. Until one of us stops choosing, stops breathing, stops being. And even then, whatever's left of me will keep choosing whatever's left of you.

This letter is too long. Too much. Too everything. Like you. Like us. Like the love that's reorganized my molecular structure into something that only makes sense in relation to you.

Say yes. Or say no. But know this: I'm already yours in ways that would require surgery to undo.

Warren

P.S. Yesterday you asked if I think we're soulmates. I said I don't believe in souls. That was true. But I believe in whatever part of you recognizes the same part in me—call it souls, call it atoms, call it the cosmic joke that made us both alive at the same time. Whatever it is, it's already said yes. The rest is just paperwork.
