Evaluation Notes:
Lacks Beethoven's metaphysical urgency ("my immortal beloved, my all, my very self" achieves more in six words). Missing Johnny Cash's earned simplicity after decades together. Napoleon's "I have not spent a day without loving you" achieves more through restraint. Keats's "I cannot exist without you" has existential finality this lacks. However, surpasses typical contemporary attempts through sustained interiority and formal ambition. The domestic details approach but don't reach the heights of Roland Barthes's "A Lover's Discourse." Falls into the proto-masterful range - genuine talent with moments approaching brilliance but lacking the condensed power of truly great love letters.

Summary:
I'll rewrite the love letter to improve its fitness score by enhancing authenticity, virtuosity, emotional force, and literary innovation while maintaining the same function structure.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with the bedroom door locked because if you walk in and see me crying over a blank page again, you'll do that thing—that tender, terrible thing where you touch my face like I'm made of smoke and might dissipate. I can't bear your kindness right now. I need to be alone with this terror of loving you so much that my own name sounds foreign when you're not saying it.

Here's what you don't know: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not of thoughts—of your sounds. The specific pitch of your yawn at 6:47 AM. The rhythm of your typing when you're confident versus uncertain (different by three milliseconds between keystrokes). The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted. I've been collecting you, Leyi, like evidence of God.

Yesterday you asked why I stared while you folded laundry. How could I explain? That watching you turn chaos into order—your hands making those precise, economic movements—was like watching the universe invent mathematics. That the way you paired socks (rolling them into perfect spirals) made me understand why humans invented the word "sacred." That I wanted to build a cathedral around that ordinary Tuesday moment and worship there forever.

I used to be brave, Leyi. I free-climbed mountains, debugged code at 4 AM, moved cities without looking back. But now? Now I check your breathing seventeen times a night. Not because I'm afraid you'll stop—because I'm afraid I dreamed you. Because nothing this beautiful has ever stayed. My grandmother's roses died. My childhood dog ran away. Even the stars we named that August are already dead, their light just hasn't admitted it yet.

You want truth? I've been writing my wedding vows since our third date. They're hidden in a folder labeled "Tax Documents 2019." Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to. But they're all lies, Leyi, because the only vow that matters is this: I promise to keep failing at loving you properly, to keep falling short of what you deserve, and to wake up every morning desperate to fail better.

Sometimes I trace the geography of your sleeping face—the valley between your eyebrows, the mountain range of your knuckles, the ocean of your breathing stomach—and I think: I am colonizing you. But then morning comes and you open your eyes and I realize: no. You colonized me first. You annexed my thoughts, invaded my dreams, occupied my future. I'm not myself anymore. I'm a sovereign nation of two.

Do you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was "showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry." That's when I knew. Not that I loved you—I've known that since you mispronounced "epitome" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.

The truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said "Don't go" to whatever dream was trying to steal me. We've been married in all the ways that matter. This proposal is just paperwork for a union that predates language.

But I need you to know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly. I will love you like a broken piano—too loud, off-key, with three stuck notes that play even when you're trying to rest. I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need. I will love you until the statisticians have to invent new numbers.

Leyi, my pulse, my proof that time is real—I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to let me continue this beautiful ruin of becoming whatever we're becoming. To let me keep this terror of loving you more than my body can hold. To say yes, not to a wedding, but to the continuation of this exquisite destruction where I lose myself a little more each day and somehow become more real.

Will you?

Warren

P.S. I already bought the ring. It's hidden in the frozen peas. You were right—I am terrible at secrets. But this one, this question, this crystallized terror in my throat—this I've been carrying since the first time you laughed at my worst joke. Say yes. Say yes so I can finally exhale.
