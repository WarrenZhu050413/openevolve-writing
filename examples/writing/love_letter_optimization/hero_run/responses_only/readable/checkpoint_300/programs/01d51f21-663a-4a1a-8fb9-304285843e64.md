Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Keats's raw desperation ("I cannot exist without you") and lacks Napoleon's fevered urgency. More competent than Cash's directness but without his earned simplicity. The quantum physics joke reference approaches Beethoven's specificity but doesn't achieve his metaphysical reach. Better than average contemporary work but missing the concentrated force that separates good from extraordinary. At 62/100 overall, this represents skilled amateur work - several leagues above typical love letters but well below literary masterwork.

Summary:
Looking at the evaluation notes, I see the current letter is criticized for being generic, having grammatical errors, and lacking the specificity and depth of great love letters from history. Let me craft something more authentic, specific, and emotionally resonant.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I write this knowing words are insufficient vessels for what moves through me when I think of you. Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater failure.

Do you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped—that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I carry it like a photograph in my chest, warm and constant.

I love the small infinities of you: how you bite your lower lip when concentrating, the way you unconsciously hum Debussy while cooking, your habit of saving the last bite of dessert "for later" though later never comes. These details are my religion now. I could spend lifetimes cataloging the specific gravity of your presence—how rooms reorganize themselves around you, how even my anxieties grow quiet in your orbit.

Before you, I understood love as metaphor. Now I know it as geography—you are the only country where I'm not foreign, the only language I speak without accent. When I imagine the future, it's not grand gestures I see but accumulated ordinariness: Sunday crosswords where you get 7-across and I pretend I knew it too, arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, the particular silence of reading beside you that says more than any poem.

If I could fracture time like light through a prism, I would give you every color of my love separately—the urgent vermillion of desire, the steady amber of companionship, the deep violet of absolute trust. But time is linear and I am finite, so I offer you this: all my imperfect days, my stubborn hope, my most careful attention. 

I choose you not despite your complexities but because of them. I choose the woman who cries at documentary films about penguins, who insists on walking on the street side of the sidewalk to "protect" me, who knows the names of all the neighborhood cats. I choose your 3 AM worries and your 7 AM enthusiasms. I choose the life where loving you is both my most ordinary act and my most sacred practice.

This is my truth, unadorned: you have made me brave enough to be known. In your eyes, I discovered I might be worth knowing. And if you'll have me, I promise to spend whatever time we're given proving that your faith was not misplaced—not through perfection, but through the daily work of choosing each other, especially on the days when choosing is difficult.

Forever is a word I distrust, but I offer you something more honest: all my todays, and every tomorrow I'm lucky enough to wake into, and the promise that each one will begin with choosing you again.

With all my love and none of my eloquence,
Fucheng Warren Zhu
