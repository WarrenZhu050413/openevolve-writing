Evaluation Notes:
This letter exists far below the masterworks. It lacks Beethoven's metaphysical anguish ("Immortal Beloved" scored 86), Johnny Cash's earned wisdom and elegant simplicity (83), Napoleon's aristocratic passion (82), or Keats's sublime fusion of eros and thanatos (81). While more original than average contemporary attempts, it substitutes quirky accounting for the soul-baring vulnerability of Oscar Wilde's prison letters (80). The quantification conceit, though clever, doesn't achieve the phenomenological depth of Virginia Woolf's letters to Vita (would score ~79) or the raw erotic force of James Joyce to Nora (controversial but ~77). This ranks as exceptional contemporary work but falls short of the proto-masterful threshold—imagine a talented MFA graduate's best effort rather than a voice for the ages.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the current program's performance, I can see that the fitness has declined from 0.7320 to 0.6790. The evaluator seems to value specific qualities that made the higher-scoring letters successful:

1. **Obsessive documentation/data collection** - The spreadsheets, counts, and lists in the top performers
2. **Specific temporal anchoring** - Exact times like "3:31 AM", "3:47 AM" 
3. **Physical immediacy** - Being in specific locations (garage floor, kitchen, car)
4. **Meta-awareness of the pathology** - Acknowledging the unhealthy/obsessive nature
5. **Concrete sensory details** - Very specific observations and measurements
6. **Building tension toward revelation** - The "you're about to find me" endings

The current version has lost some of this raw obsessive energy in favor of more conventional poetic restraint. Let me craft a new version that pushes further into the uncomfortable truth-telling that scored highest:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:19 AM in the bathroom. Door locked. Sitting on the closed toilet lid because the tiles are too cold and you'd hear me if I sat on the bedroom floor. I've been carrying this ring for 127 days. I know the exact number because I have a spreadsheet. Cell A1 says "Day 1: Bought ring, threw up in jeweler's parking lot." Cell A127 says "Still a coward."

You want truth? I've been documenting you like evidence for a crime I'm committing. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Videos of you sleep-talking about grocery lists. A database—yes, an actual database—tracking your moods against barometric pressure because I thought there was a pattern. There is. You're sadder when it rains, except Thursdays. I don't know why Thursdays are immune. I've run seventeen statistical models.

Here's what I need you to know: I measure your breathing. Fourteen breaths per minute sleeping. Twenty-three when anxious. Eleven that night after your father called—so slow I kept checking your pulse. I have a notebook where I write down every time you mispronounce a word. Current count: 47. "Specifically" as "pacifically" when angry. "Library" as "liberry" when tired. I will never correct you. I will take these mispronunciations to my grave. They're mine now.

Last Tuesday, 2:34 PM, you were peeling a tangerine in the kitchen. Just standing there, back to me, dropping peels into the sink. Juice on your fingers. The smell filled the room and I had to leave because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience. I sat in my car and googled "can you die from loving someone too much." WebMD says no but WebMD is wrong. I'm dying, Leyi. Cell by cell. And each dead cell is replaced by one that only knows how to want you.

You don't know this but I've assigned numbers to your laughs. Type 1: Polite, for strangers. Type 2: Real but contained. Type 3: The snort-laugh you're embarrassed by. Type 4: Silent shoulder-shaking when something's so funny you can't breathe. Type 5: The one that's just for me, usually at 2 AM when I say something stupid. I live for Type 5. I would commit felonies for Type 5.

Three months ago you reorganized my kitchen drawers. Moved the utensils. Mixed the forks with spoons like some kind of anarchist. My first thought wasn't annoyance. It was "she's planning to stay." I haven't moved them back. I never will. I want archaeologists to find our bones and be confused by our chaotic silverware choices.

The truth—the ugly, quantifiable, pathological truth—is that I've been testing myself. Seeing how long I can go without looking at your pictures. Record: 47 minutes. Failed during a work presentation. My colleague asked why I was crying. I said allergies. I'm not allergic to anything except the thought of you choosing someone else.

I need you to understand: I was complete before you. I had hobbies that weren't "memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder" (14.7 PSI on average, increases to 18.2 when you're excited). I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: seconds until I see you, seconds since I saw you. There is no present tense, only the echo and anticipation of you.

Here's what terrifies me: You're asleep twenty feet away. Diagonal distance through the wall: 23.7 feet, I measured. You have no idea I'm in here, writing draft thirty-one of this letter while sitting on a toilet, crying quietly enough not to wake you. In twelve minutes your alarm will go off. You'll hit snooze twice. At 4:43 AM you'll actually get up, shuffle to the bathroom, find me here surrounded by crumpled paper, and ask what the hell I'm doing.

And I'll hand you this letter. This confession. This evidence of my complete psychological collapse. Because you wanted truth and the truth is I'm not proposing—I'm plea bargaining. I'm already guilty of loving you past the point of sanity. The ring is just a formality. The wedding is just paperwork. In my mind, we've been married since that Thursday you fixed my collar and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for exactly 31 minutes. I know because I checked my phone log. Missed four calls. Didn't care.

So here's my truth, Leyi: I would rather choke on this confession than pretend for one more day that I'm normal about you. I'm not normal about you. I'm clinical about you. I have spreadsheets about you. I've calculated that I think about you every 11.3 seconds on average. That's 7,646 times per day. I've named our unborn children in seventeen different combinations. I practice your signature with my last name. I practice my signature with your last name. I practice a hyphenated version just to cover all bases.

Please. Marry me. Not the theoretical better version of me but this actual disaster who counts your breaths, who catalogs your laughs, who would rather die than delete even one of the 2,341 photos, who's been sitting on this toilet for twenty-seven minutes now and can't feel his left foot but won't move because he's terrified of losing the courage to give you this letter.

Your alarm's about to go off. You're about to find me. My entire future depends on the next ninety seconds.

I love you like a fever of 103.7 degrees. I measured.

Yours in whatever dimension will take me,
Warren

P.S. I know you pretend to hate math but you do sudoku in pen when you think I'm not looking. I have 73 photos of you concentrating on number puzzles. Your nose wrinkles in the same spot every time. Grid reference: 1.3cm left of center. This is the kind of man you're considering marrying. A man who measures your nose wrinkles. Please consider it anyway. Please.
