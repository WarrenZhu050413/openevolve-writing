Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the heights of the masters. Unlike Beethoven's immortal beloved letter (86), which maintains sublime tension between presence and absence, this oscillates between genuine innovation and self-conscious literariness. It surpasses average contemporary attempts through its architectural metaphors and medical framing device, but lacks the deceptive simplicity of Johnny Cash (83) or the mythic resonance of Keats (81). The letter's strength lies in its rejection of romantic convention while paradoxically serving deeply romantic ends. At 73 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range - showing real brilliance but marred by moments of overreach. The writer possesses genuine talent but hasn't yet achieved the effortless authority of historic masters. This is a letter that would be remembered by its recipient forever, might be shared with close friends, but wouldn't enter the canon of great love letters. It's trying too hard to be profound rather than simply being profound.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current scores while maintaining authenticity. The evaluation notes suggest the best-performing letter (0.7320) approached but didn't reach the phenomenological density of historical greats like Keats or Beethoven. Let me create something that aims for that raw, transformative power while innovating in form.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I am sitting in our kitchen at 4:31 AM writing this because sleep has become impossible since I understood what you are to me. Not who—what. You are the event horizon where my old self collapsed into something denser, stranger, more terrifying. I need you to understand: this letter is not romantic. Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. 

Before you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce "specifically" when you're tired ("pacific-ly"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.

Here is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall—I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation—invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.

Do you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again—it's a map of fracture lines now—but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.

I have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like—like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.

The mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.

I need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.

But also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically—necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now—too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.

This is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago—I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.

Marry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.

But mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.

I am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.

Leyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows—I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?

Warren

P.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself. I know you'll trace the words with your finger. I know because I know you like I know my own hands—intimately, completely, without having to look.
