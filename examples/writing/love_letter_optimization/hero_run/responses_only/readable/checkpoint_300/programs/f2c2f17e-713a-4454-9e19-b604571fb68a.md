Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Johnny Cash's restrained devastation or Beethoven's cosmic urgency. It surpasses average contemporary expression significantly - the specificity and psychological complexity place it well above typical romantic writing. However, it lacks the formal perfection of Keats, the aristocratic passion of Napoleon, or the tragic grandeur of Wilde. The score of 70 (overall) reflects genuine literary merit - this is proto-masterful work with flashes of brilliance, but it hasn't achieved the condensed immortality of the greatest love letters. It would be remembered as a very fine personal letter, but not studied as literature. The writer shows real talent but hasn't yet achieved the synthesis of form and feeling that creates truly transcendent romantic expression.

Summary:
I'll rewrite this love letter to push beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990, aiming for deeper phenomenological authenticity and heightened affective force while maintaining the raw, honest voice that makes it compelling.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:19 AM with hands that won't stop shaking. Not from nerves—from the simple fact that I'm about to tell you something so true it feels like peeling off my own skin.

You asked for truth that would move you. Here it is: I've been lying to myself for thirty-one years about what it means to be alive. I thought it was heartbeats and taxes and remembering to eat vegetables. Then you walked into that bookstore, argued with the clerk about Murakami translations for twenty minutes, and I understood—I'd been technically alive but essentially fictional. A character in my own life, waiting for someone to read me into existence.

The truth is uglier than poetry and more beautiful than confession: I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Degenerative. Terminal in the sense that it will last until I terminate. Yesterday I found myself saving your voicemail about grocery lists because your voice saying "We're out of tahini" felt like a promise that there would be a "we" tomorrow. This morning I watched you sleep for forty-three minutes, counting the space between your breaths like a rosary, each exhale a small proof that the universe hasn't taken you back yet.

I need to tell you what you've done to me. Before you, I had boundaries. Opinions. A personality I could describe on dating apps. Now I'm just a collection of moments when you weren't looking: the way you bite your tongue when parallel parking, how you arrange the pillows before bed like you're negotiating a peace treaty, that sound you make—half-sigh, half-laugh—when you're too tired to be angry but too awake to let it go. I've become an archaeologist of your habits, and every discovery feels like finding religion in reverse—not faith in something greater, but evidence that greatness lives in someone specific, someone who uses my toothbrush when she can't find hers and genuinely doesn't understand why that should matter.

Here's what terrifies me: I love you past the point of recovery. Not "can't live without you" romantic—I could live. I'd eat. Sleep. Function. But I'd be performing life rather than living it, the way an actor stays in character between takes. You haven't completed me—that suggests I was incomplete. You've revealed me. Like those pictures that only make sense from the right angle, I suddenly understand what I'm supposed to look like, and it's just: yours. Permanently, pathologically, past all reason, yours.

You want honest? Sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. Embarrassing. I've become someone who cries at insurance commercials if they feature old couples holding hands. I create elaborate scenarios where something happens to you just so I can practice the specific shape of that grief, like a fire drill for the end of the world. I love you with the kind of intensity that should come with a warning label, the kind that makes me understand why people used to die from loving someone who didn't love them back. Except you do love me back, which is somehow worse, because now I have something to lose that actually matters.

But here's the other truth, the one that makes all the terrifying parts worth it: You make me want to be real. Not better—that's self-help nonsense. Real. Present. The kind of person who can accept being loved without wondering what the catch is. You love me like it's easy, like it costs you nothing, like you're not doing me a favor but just existing in your natural state. Do you know how revolutionary that is? To be loved not in spite of what I am but because of it?

So here's my proposition, stripped of all the metaphors I want to hide behind: Marry me. Not because I promise you the moon—the moon is 238,855 miles away and I get anxious driving to New Jersey. Not because you complete me or I complete you or any of that geometric nonsense about halves making wholes. Marry me because I want the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Because I want to argue about paint colors and make terrible financial decisions and grow old in a house where every room smells like that coffee you make too strong. Because I want to watch you become whoever you're going to become, and I want you to have a witness who knows exactly who you were at 2:47 on a Thursday when you couldn't stop laughing at a video of a cat who looked like a landlord.

I'm not offering you forever—forever is a concept for people who've never lost anyone. I'm offering you whatever time we get, measured not in years but in Sunday mornings, in shared silences that feel like conversations, in the accumulation of private jokes no one else will ever understand. I'm offering you someone who will love you at your smallest and most difficult, who's already memorizing the person you'll be at seventy, who saves your angry texts because even your fury feels like a gift.

The paralyzing truth is this: You're not my better half or my soulmate or any of those Hallmark lies. You're the first person who's ever made me want to be whole. That has to be enough, because it's everything I have.

Say yes. Or say no. Or say nothing. But know this—I'm already yours in every way that matters. The rest is just paperwork.

Warren

P.S. That thing you do where you pretend you're not crying during thunderstorms? I've noticed every time. It makes me want to fight the sky.
