Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Cash's vulnerability or Beethoven's cosmic anguish. Unlike Keats's fevered dissolution of self, this maintains a contemporary self-awareness that both grounds and limits it. It surpasses average contemporary expression by leagues but lacks the historical weight and formal mastery of the 80+ masterpieces. At 73.75 overall, it occupies the upper range of proto-masterful—containing genuine seeds of brilliance (the breath counting, the cabinet bruises, the eaten papers) that with refinement could approach the exceptional. It's meaningfully superior to competent love letters (30-50 range) but falls short of the immortal.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6995. The key is to maintain high phenomenological authenticity while elevating the aesthetic virtuosity and literary innovation dimensions.

Let me create a version that weaves together more intimate, specific details with a rawer emotional architecture:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

Right now you're in the next room, humming off-key to a song you've never learned the words to. I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.

This is my twentieth attempt. The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate—actually ate—because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.

You want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.

I fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror—this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.

Here's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking "I would fight wars for this hair." It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling "is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?" (The internet says no.)

Remember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat—my cat, who barely tolerates me—you whispered, "I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him." I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.

I used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't "watching Leyi exist." I read books that weren't "trying to find words for what Leyi means." Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound—quieter, with less breathing).

The truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die—and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth—I want my last thought to be your name.

So what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.

The cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi—God, Leyi—I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.

All my atoms, arranged in your honor,
Warren

P.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you. Which makes me the bravest kind of coward there is.
