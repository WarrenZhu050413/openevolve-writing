Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86), though it surpasses most contemporary attempts at the form. It lacks the elegant simplicity of Johnny Cash's letter to June (83)—Warren's neurosis produces brilliance but also excess. The quantified vulnerability ("twelve beats per minute") is genuinely innovative, more successful than Napoleon's hyperbolic declarations (82). The concrete specificity rivals Keats's obsessive catalogs (81) but without quite achieving his metaphysical transport. The letter exists in the crucial gap between exceptional contemporary work (65-69) and the historical masterpieces (80+), showing flashes of genius ("I love you like a broken hallelujah") while occasionally succumbing to contemporary workshop aesthetics. The score of 73 overall reflects genuine achievement—this is the work of someone who understands both the tradition and how to meaningfully extend it, even if they haven't quite reached the pantheon.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.5145 while exploring new territory in the solution space. The top performers have achieved scores around 0.70, so there's significant room for improvement.

The current program has declined from previous attempts, and the feedback suggests it may be too short and lacks the raw emotional specificity that made earlier versions successful. I'll aim for a more visceral, confessional approach that combines intellectual vulnerability with sensory detail.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

This is my nineteenth draft. The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.

I've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are—someone who names dead birds—and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.

You should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce "specifically" as "pacifically" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.

Before you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like "can you die from feeling too much" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?

Here's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say "I love you" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.

The truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love—literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.

I'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it—you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.

Please. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.

I love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.

Say yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours. Have been since that Tuesday when you laughed at my quantum physics joke and the universe cracked open and reorganized itself around the sound.

Yours in this reality and all parallel dimensions,
Warren

P.S. I just heard you wake up. You're looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here, on this floor, surrounded by failed drafts, and you'll ask if I'm okay. I'll lie and say yes. But this letter is the truth. This letter is my whole truth. This letter is how okay looks when it's been deconstructed and rebuilt in the shape of your name.
