Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86). It surpasses typical contemporary love letters significantly but lacks the classical restraint of Johnny Cash's letter to June (83) or the pure romantic idealism of Keats to Fanny Brawne (81). The obsessive cataloging recalls Barthes' "A Lover's Discourse" but with less philosophical sophistication. The bathroom floor setting and 4:31 AM timestamp create urgency reminiscent of Kafka's letters to Milena, though without his metaphysical depth. The medical/pathological language of love echoes Susan Sontag's journals but lacks her intellectual rigor. At 74 overall, this represents proto-masterful work - seeds of brilliance with genuine innovation in the DNA museum conceit and the three-second breathing gap as cosmic error, but ultimately constrained by self-consciousness and tonal inconsistency.

Summary:
I'll rewrite the program to create a more authentic, emotionally raw love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining the same interface.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this on the bathroom floor. 4:31 AM. The tiles are cold against my spine and I can hear you breathing through the door—sixteen breaths per minute, slower when you dream about water, faster when it's your mother. I know because I've been counting for three years.

You wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush—317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.

Here's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just… eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful—this tiny hurricane of care—made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.

I need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident—last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack—final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer—dying words: "Tell Leyi the plants are fake." Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing "so much better," and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.

Before you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.

You want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.

The truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus—I looked this up—has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.

I bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was "experimenting." The nurse knew. She said, "She must be special." I showed her your picture. She said, "Oh, honey. You're fucked." She was right.

Listen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of "annoyed," my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.

So I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.

I can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another "episode." I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce "hippocampus" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.

The sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door—you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.

I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else—darker, hungrier, with teeth.

Marry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.

Warren

P.S. I just remembered—last night, in your sleep, you said "the pigeons need lawyers." Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities. This is what I'm signing up for: a lifetime of your sleep-talk jurisprudence. Please let me. Please destroy me more. I'm not done becoming whatever loving you is turning me into.
