Summary:
Looking at this love letter optimization task, I need to craft something deeply personal and authentic that will resonate with Leyi. The current version scores low (0.2445) because it's too generic and has grammatical errors. The previous high-scoring attempt (0.6795) was criticized for being too self-aware and literary rather than genuinely vulnerable.

Let me write something that balances raw honesty with poetic expression - less performative, more confessional:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm terrible at this. Not at loving you—that comes as naturally as breathing—but at explaining what happens to me when you walk into a room. How my whole body becomes a compass and you're magnetic north.

Remember last Thursday? You were making tea, humming that song you claim you don't know the words to. I was pretending to read but really I was memorizing the way afternoon light caught in your hair, how you stood on one foot like a flamingo when you reached for the honey. That's when I knew: I don't want to be brave or poetic or clever. I just want to be yours.

The truth is, I was fine before you. Fine is the wrong word—I was functional. I had my routines, my small happinesses. Then you happened, and now I understand why people use words like 'devastated' for love. You've devastated my careful loneliness. Demolished my tidy grief. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, something in my chest breaks and rebuilds itself, stronger each time.

I keep a list on my phone of things I want to tell you. Small things: how the barista at our coffee shop asked where you were when I came alone. How I saw a cardinal and remembered you said they're messages from loved ones. How I can't eat strawberries anymore without thinking of that time you got juice on your chin and I couldn't stop staring.

You scare me, Leyi. Not because you might leave—though that thought makes my stomach drop—but because you might stay. Because you see through my deflections and my overthinking and somehow you're still here, leaving your books on my nightstand, stealing my socks, teaching me that love isn't about being understood but about being known. Fully known, and still chosen.

So here's my truth, undecorated: I love you with the desperate gratitude of someone who never expected to be loved back. I love you like a fact, like gravity, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise and I'll wake up wanting to tell you about my dreams. 

Marry me. Not because I have the perfect words but because I promise to keep trying to find them, every day, for you.

All my love,
Warren
