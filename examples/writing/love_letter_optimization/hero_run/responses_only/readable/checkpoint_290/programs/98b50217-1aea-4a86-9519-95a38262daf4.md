Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's notes, I can see that the current program scores 0.6870, which is a slight decline from the previous best of 0.6995. The evaluator's notes from previous attempts indicate that the highest-scoring letters achieve their power through:

1. **Specific, visceral details** (like "47 freckles," "3:47 AM," "2.5 sugars in coffee")
2. **Raw vulnerability** without literary pretension
3. **Unique metaphors** that feel discovered rather than constructed
4. **Emotional urgency** that transcends self-consciousness

The evaluator particularly values phenomenological authenticity and affective force. Let me craft a letter that pushes into more vulnerable, specific territory while maintaining literary innovation.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

My hands are shaking. Not poetically—actually shaking. I've deleted this seventeen times because every word feels like a lie next to the truth of you.

Here's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's waking up at 4:23 AM in a cold sweat because you dreamed she left. It's checking your phone fourteen times during a meeting to see if she texted. It's forgetting how to breathe normally when she walks into Trader Joe's wearing your old Columbia sweatshirt, the one with the coffee stain shaped like Italy on the left sleeve.

I wasn't looking for you. I had my life—my predictable Thursdays, my rational decisions, my carefully maintained emotional distance. Then you laughed at my stupid joke about sourdough starters that night at Diana's party, and something inside me broke. Not romantically. Literally broke. Like a bone that had healed wrong and needed to be reset.

You want truth? I Google "how to be a better partner" at least twice a week. I practice conversations with you in the shower. Last Tuesday, I spent forty minutes in the parking lot of CVS because your favorite song came on and I couldn't drive while crying. I save your voicemails—all of them, even the one where you just say "shit, wrong number" and hang up.

I know you hate when people say you're beautiful when you first wake up, but you are. Not Instagram beautiful—real beautiful. The kind that makes me forget I'm supposed to be doing something else. Your morning face is my favorite conspiracy theory: How can someone look like home? How can messy hair and crushed pillow lines add up to the only mathematics I believe in?

Remember when my dad had his heart surgery? You didn't say any of the right things. You said, "This fucking sucks" and then you organized my sock drawer while I sat on the bathroom floor. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you—I already knew that. But that you loved me in the way I needed to be loved: practically, honestly, without decoration.

I'm scared of so many things. Spiders. Cancer. That noise the refrigerator makes at 2 AM. But mostly I'm scared that I'll never be able to explain what happens to my molecular structure when you laugh. How you've ruined every song, every street corner, every cup of coffee by not being in them. How "before you" feels like a story someone else told me about someone else's life.

You are not my everything—that would make me nothing. You are my something. My very specific, irreplaceable, Thursday-afternoon-in-the-kitchen-light something. You are the first person I want to tell when I see a dog. You are my 11:11 wish, every time, even though I don't believe in wishes. You are the reason I now understand why my grandmother kept my grandfather's voicemails for twenty years after he died.

I don't want to marry you because I can't live without you. I want to marry you because I've finally learned how to live with you—messily, honestly, with all my dumb jokes and midnight anxieties and the way I need to check that the door is locked three times before bed. I want to marry you because you make me brave enough to be exactly who I am: a man who cries at Pixar movies, who can't parallel park, who loves you with the graceless desperation of someone who never expected to be loved back.

So here it is, Leyi, my truth without metaphors: I choose you. Not in a grand, swoeping gesture way. In a Tuesday morning way. In a "let's figure out what's for dinner" way. In a "your feet are freezing, put them on me" way. In the smallest, most daily, most permanent way I know how to choose anything.

Please. Marry me. Let me love you with all my ordinary, extraordinary, terrified heart for as long as you'll let me.

Yours (shaking hands and all),
Warren
