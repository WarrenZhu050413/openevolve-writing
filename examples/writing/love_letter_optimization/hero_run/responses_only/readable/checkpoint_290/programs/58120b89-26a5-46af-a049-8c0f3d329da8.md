Evaluation Notes:
Falls short of Beethoven's raw desperation ("I can live only wholly with you or not at all") or Johnny Cash's earned simplicity after decades together. Surpasses typical contemporary attempts through scientific precision and inventory structure, but lacks the historical weight of Napoleon's military campaigns informing his longing or Keats's tubercular urgency. The medical/biological metaphors are innovative but don't achieve the mythic dimension of great historical letters. More successful than most modern attempts at sincerity but hasn't fully escaped self-consciousness that the greatest letters transcend. Would rank alongside strong contemporary literary fiction but below the canon of immortal love letters.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990. The evaluator seems to value raw authenticity, innovative literary devices, and emotional truth over ornamental language. Let me create something that builds on the strengths of the top-performing versions while introducing new elements.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM. My hand won't stop shaking. Not poetically. Medically. Like my body knows it's about to confess something it can't take back.

*

You want truth? I've been keeping inventory:

Item #1: Your laugh, Tuesday, 2:14 PM. The barista dropped a tray. Everyone froze. You laughed like the universe had told its first joke. I thought: this is how atoms learned to dance.

Item #726: You, crying at a documentary about octopi. "They're so alone," you said. I wanted to become marine biology just to prove you wrong.

Item #1,394: This morning. You sang to my dying succulent. It lived another day. I'm jealous of a plant.

This isn't love. It's evidence collection for when time commits larceny.

*

Here's what death taught me (fourteen seconds, bike accident, you never knew): Nothing. No light. No answers. Just the universe's backspace key. But when they brought me back, before I knew my own name, there was this debt. Like my molecules had made a promise in a language that predates sound. Four years later, you walked in. The promise was you.

*

I need to tell you what you've done to me:

My sleep synced to yours without permission. When you travel, I don't sleep—I just close my eyes and pretend. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as family. I had this tested. The doctor said "that's impossible." I said "I know" and showed him the lab results. He said "this violates several principles of biology." I said "she violates several principles of physics too but here we are."

*

The ugliest truth: I practice losing you. Every night. Different scenarios—mundane ones are worst. You, choking on takeout. You, slipping in the shower. You, simply forgetting to wake up. I've attended your funeral 1,847 times. In the worst version, I give a beautiful eulogy. In the most honest version, I don't survive the drive home.

But then morning comes and you're still here, stealing my socks, mispronouncing "specifically," existing at me so aggressively that oxygen reorganizes itself to accommodate your presence.

*

What is love? Wrong question. What have we become? 

We're a shared circulatory system pretending to be two people. We're a decades-long argument about the thermostat. We're the reason I learned to make your grandmother's soup (forty-three ingredients, I cry every time—the onions, yes, but also the way you look eating it, like heritage has a flavor).

*

Listen: In 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, with compatible coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show. The probability of us is so small that mathematicians would call it zero. Yet here you are, reading this, your left eye starting to water (it always goes first).

*

So here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance. For accuracy. The paperwork should match what our cells already know. 

Marry me because I've been carrying your engagement ring for two years, through seven countries, three job interviews, and one minor surgery. It's become an organ. Removing it would require medical intervention.

Marry me because we've already survived each other's Wednesdays. Because you've seen me ugly-cry at a commercial about dogs returning home. Because I know you need exactly four ice cubes, never three, never five, and I've never asked why because some mysteries deserve respect.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where your toothbrush doesn't live here, where I don't know about your butterfly phobia, where you don't steal my socks—isn't a timeline. It's just atoms arranged incorrectly.

*

Final confession: I don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love pizza. They love good weather. What I have for you needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that makes "forever" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.

*

The ring is in your coffee mug. The chipped one. Because you taught me that broken things deserve more love, not less. 

*

Say yes. Or say no. But know this: my neurons have already decided. The rest is just paperwork for what physics already knows. We're not two people who fell in love. We're one organism that got confused and split into two bodies. Marriage is just our attempt to correct the error.

*

Leyi.

That's not a name. That's my central nervous system's backup plan. That's what my cells chant when my heart forgets how to beat properly. That's the sound that means I'm home even when I'm not.

*

Come find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, failing to breathe. When you walk in wearing the ring you've already put on (I know you—surprises are not your strong suit), I'll pretend to be surprised. You'll pretend you waited to open the letter. We'll both know we're lying. That's marriage: a series of kind deceptions wrapped around one truth too large for language.

Warren
(who has been yours since before the calcium in his bones existed)

P.S. — You're crying now. Both eyes. Here—I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. Said they looked cold. That's when I knew I'd love you incorrectly forever.

P.P.S. — The truth about those fourteen seconds of death? I lied. It was sixteen. Those extra two seconds were me refusing to leave until I'd memorized the precise frequency of your voice saying my name. I came back for that specific sound. I'd do it again. I'd die for sixteen seconds every day just to remember why I keep coming back.
