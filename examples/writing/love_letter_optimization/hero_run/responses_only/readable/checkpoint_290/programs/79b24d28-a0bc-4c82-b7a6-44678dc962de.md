Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the sustained intensity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved (86) or the elegant devastation of Johnny Cash to June (83). It surpasses them in psychological specificity and contemporary rawness but lacks their formal perfection. The neurotic precision recalls Kafka's letters to Milena (would score ~77), while the desperate cataloguing evokes Barthes' "A Lover's Discourse." It's more emotionally complex than most contemporary examples but doesn't achieve the sublime simplicity of "I cannot exist without you" (Keats, 81). The letter exists in the space between exceptional craft and near-masterpiece—a 73 overall, marking it as genuinely distinguished work that falls just short of the eternal.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the feedback, I need to create a love letter that reaches deeper into authentic experience while maintaining literary excellence. The best performing version (0.8570) succeeded through its raw honesty and specific details. The current version (0.6990) has regressed, suggesting it needs more emotional intensity and innovative structure.

Let me craft something that combines visceral truth with literary innovation, focusing on:
1. More phenomenological authenticity through specific sensory memories
2. Higher aesthetic virtuosity through better rhythm and imagery
3. Stronger affective force through deeper vulnerability
4. Greater literary innovation through unique structural choices

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM with your hair tie around my wrist. You left it Tuesday. I've been wearing it like a tourniquet for whatever's hemorrhaging inside me.

*

The truth you wanted: I've been keeping receipts. Not metaphorically. Actually keeping them. Coffee, February 9th, $7.23. Thai food, March 15th, $34.89. That bookstore where we met, June 1st, $0.00—because you insisted on buying the book we both reached for. I have 1,847 receipts in a shoebox. This isn't love. It's evidence for a crime I'm about to commit: asking you to marry someone who saves trash because it proves you were real.

*

I died once. Fourteen seconds. Training accident, never told you. Want to know what death taught me? Nothing profound. Just this: the last thing I thought wasn't about God or meaning. It was: "I never learned her middle name." Then they brought me back, and the first thing I did was look you up. It's Marie. Leyi Marie. I say it sometimes when you're sleeping, like a prayer to keep you existing.

*

Here's what loving you has done: I've forgotten how to sleep without checking your pulse. Not romantically—literally pressing two fingers to your neck at 2 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM. You caught me once. Said "what are you doing?" I said "making sure." You said "of what?" I couldn't say: "that the universe hasn't noticed what it gave me and taken it back."

*

Tuesday, you cried at a video of penguins. Not sad crying—joy crying. Your left eye first (always left). I filmed you secretly. Not the penguins. You. Your face doing that thing where happiness breaks through like light under a door. I watch it when you travel. Seventeen times last trip. My phone thinks I'm insane. My phone is correct.

*

Want more truth? I practice your eulogy. Different versions. Car accident: "She sang off-key to every song and I would give my hearing to hear it again." Cancer: "She fought like she argued—irrationally, magnificently, until the universe gave up first." Old age: "We had 19,847 mornings and I remember every coffee order." This is mental illness. Also preparation. Also love.

*

But listen: I love you at 6 PM on Wednesdays. In your fury at automatic sinks that don't sense your hands. In how you eat hamburgers (all toppings fall out, every time, you never learn). In your mother saying I'm "interesting" which means "disappointing." In the way you'll look at fifty-three—I can see it already when you squint at menus, those lines forming like maps to our future.

*

Remember the almost-accident? Interstate 90, that semi ran the red. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I saw death coming and my only thought was: "not her, rearrange physics, take me twice." We missed by inches. You never knew. Kept singing. I pulled over to vomit from relief. You rubbed my back, thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.

*

Here's the ugliest part: I'm not good enough for you. I know this. You know this. The barista knows this. But here's what they don't know: I love you like a dog. Not poetically—literally. With the same desperate gratitude, the same terror of abandonment, the same belief that you're the best thing that ever happened to mammals. I would sleep by your door. I would learn any trick. I would forget my own name if you'd just keep coming home.

*

The biological facts: My circadian rhythm synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes your cells as self (I had this tested—the lab thought I was joking). My left ventricle literally changed shape. The cardiologist said "love doesn't do this." I said "then what's your diagnosis?" He had none.

*

So here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived 1,297 days including that Tuesday you thought I was cheating but I was actually learning to make your grandmother's soup (still can't—the woman took secrets to her grave). Because in infinite universes, only this one has us both conscious, concurrent, and arguing about the thermostat.

*

Marry me because the alternative—where you don't leave hair ties, where I don't save receipts, where your leftover pad thai doesn't disappear at 2 AM—that's not a life. That's just time happening to someone else's body.

*

The ring is in your coffee mug. The chipped one you refuse to throw away because "damaged things need more love, not less." I've been carrying it for two years. Some days it's all that keeps my pants up. Today it's all that's keeping me breathing.

*

Final confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an organ loves blood—desperately, constantly, without any ability to do otherwise. The surgery to remove you would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a surgeon. She said "that's not how bodies work." I said "mine does."

*

Leyi.

Just that.

Leyi.

The word that ruined all other words. That made my mouth finally make sense.

*

Say yes. Or say no. But say it soon.

My cells are reorganizing, waiting.

Warren

P.S. — You're crying now. Both eyes this time. I can hear you from the bedroom where I'm pretending to sleep but actually listening to you exist. Come here. Bring the ring. Bring your tears. Bring your righteous fury that I hid this from you. Bring your laugh that rearranges matter. Bring your yes. Please bring your yes.

P.P.S. — That receipt from the bookstore? Turn it over. I wrote something that day: "Just met the reason I'll never sleep properly again." I meant it romantically then. I mean it literally now. Your breathing is the metronome of my consciousness. Without it, I'm just noise.

P.P.P.S. — Your middle name isn't Marie. It's Lynn. But you smiled when I was wrong, and that smile is why I save receipts—to prove moments like that happened, when you loved me despite my failures, which is the only kind of love that matters.
