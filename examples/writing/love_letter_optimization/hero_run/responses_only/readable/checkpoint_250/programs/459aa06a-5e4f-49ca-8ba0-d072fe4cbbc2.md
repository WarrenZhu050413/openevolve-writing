Evaluation Notes:
This letter occupies a liminal space between accomplished contemporary craft and proto-masterpiece. It lacks Beethoven's pure emotional directness ("My angel, my all, my very self" achieves more with less) and Johnny Cash's earned simplicity ("You still fascinate and inspire me" after decades together). However, it surpasses typical contemporary attempts through genuine philosophical investigation of love as ontological condition. The grammatical collapse metaphor approaches Keats's "I cannot exist without you" but with postmodern self-awareness. Unlike Napoleon's operatic declarations to Josephine, this letter's strength lies in its anxious interiority and temporal experiments. It achieves perhaps 85% of what Carson's "The Glass Essay" accomplishes in investigating love as linguistic and phenomenological crisis, but in epistolary rather than verse form. The letter exists in the tradition of Barthes's "A Lover's Discourse" - fragmentary, analytical, yet still reaching toward the unsayable.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while addressing the fitness decline. The top performers have been stuck around 0.73-0.74, and the evaluator notes consistently mention that while these letters are excellent contemporary work, they lack the transcendent quality of historical masterpieces.

Let me craft something that aims higher - more raw, more structurally innovative, and more phenomenologically precise:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in my own blood. No—that's a lie. I'm writing this in blue ink at 4:03 AM but it feels like blood, like something essential is leaving me and entering this page. You wanted truth? Truth is that I've been dead for years and meeting you was my first breath.

Listen: there's a grammatical error in the way I love you. Subject and object have collapsed. I can no longer conjugate myself without you as the verb.

Three things happened when you entered my life:
1. Time broke. Not metaphorically. I mean I now experience Thursday before Wednesday if Thursday contains more of you.
2. My body reorganized. My cells spell your name in their division. Scientists would call this cancer. I call it evolution.
3. I discovered I'd been pronouncing my own name wrong until you said it.

Here's what terrifies me: I've started dreaming in your voice. Not hearing it—thinking in it. My subconscious has been colonized. When I try to remember my mother's face, she has your eyes. This should disturb me. Instead, it feels like correction.

The truth about our first meeting: You were explaining why you hate umbrellas, gesturing with a half-eaten apple, and I experienced what medieval mystics called "the wound of love"—literal, stigmatic, bleeding internally from proximity to the divine. Except you're not divine. You're devastatingly human. You have that scar on your thumb from trying to save a butterfly when you were seven. Divine would be easier to survive.

I need to confess: I've been stealing from you. Not objects—moments. The way light hits your collar at 5 PM. Your Thursday mood versus your Monday mood (Thursday-you believes in justice; Monday-you just wants toast). The specific angle of your disappointment when I pretend to understand your dreams but don't. I hoard these thefts in what used to be my personality. Now I'm just a museum of you, and the curator has gone insane.

Two weeks ago, you said "Love is just pattern recognition" while doing the crossword. Wrong. Love is pattern destruction. You've made chaos of my careful systems. My alphabetized books are now organized by which ones you've touched. My meals happen when you're hungry. My sleep schedule has become a hypothesis about when you might need me.

Here's the medical truth: My body is failing at being singular. When you cut your hand cooking, I bled sympathetically—same hand, same line, no wound. The doctor said "Psychological." I said "Inevitable." We were both describing love, just using different languages.

But the real truth, the one that makes me write this at 4 AM with hands that won't stop shaking: You're my only proof that I exist. Not romantically—ontologically. Without you, I'm theoretical. A possibility that never actualizes. You make me real by seeing me, but more terrifyingly, by continuing to look.

I don't want to marry you. Marriage is too small, too human, too finite. I want something unnamed—to exist in the space between your heartbeats, to haunt you benevolently, to rewrite the laws of physics so that two objects can occupy the same space, be the same space.

You're reading this thinking I'm exaggerating. I'm diminishing. The actual truth would require me to invent new punctuation, something between a question and a scream, a mark that means "I would rather be wrong with you than right in any universe where we're strangers."

So here's my offer, though "offer" suggests you have options and we both know choice is an illusion when it comes to this: Let me love you incorrectly but specifically. Let me fail at containing this feeling that's too large for a human frame. Let me spend whatever time we have learning the specific weight of your sadness, the exact temperature of your joy, the precise sound of your silence when you're solving things in your head.

The woman you are when you think no one's watching—that's who I'm proposing to. The one who talks to houseplants like they're disappointing children. Who practices arguments in the shower for confrontations that will never happen. Who keeps dead batteries in the drawer because throwing them away feels like giving up on their potential. That specific, impossible, irreplaceable you.

I'm not promising forever. Forever is a lie told by people who've never watched time devour everything. I'm promising now, with such intensity that it burns through time, leaves scars on tomorrow, makes yesterday jealous. I'm promising to love you in a way that makes the universe take notes.

You want to know if this will move you? You've already moved me. Seismically. I'm a different geography now. There are fault lines where you've touched me, and I'm earthquake-ready, waiting for you to shift me again.

This letter is dying now. Each word you read kills it a little more. By the time you reach this sentence, it will be over, and you'll have to decide: Do you marry the person who wrote this, or the person you've made me become by reading it? 

Trick question. They're both yours. Have always been yours. Will be yours even in the universes where we never meet, where I die wondering why happiness feels like something I'm forgetting.

Say yes. Or say no. But know that I've already married you in every dimension where time isn't linear, where love is the only physics that matters, where your name is the only sound that makes my atoms agree to stay together.

Yours in the most embarrassing and essential way,
Warren

P.S. That thing you said about cereal being cold soup? It made me understand religion. Not God—the need for God. The need to name the unnameable thing that happens when you exist near me. I'm converting to whatever church worships that.
