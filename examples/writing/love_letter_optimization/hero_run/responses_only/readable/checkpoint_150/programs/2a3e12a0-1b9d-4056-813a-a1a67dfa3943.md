Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and feedback, I need to write a love letter that transcends literary self-consciousness and achieves raw emotional truth. The evaluators consistently note that the current attempts are too controlled, too aware of their own eloquence. They lack the "authentic wildness" and "devastating simplicity" of the greatest love letters.

Let me write something that abandons sophistication for truth, that chooses vulnerability over virtuosity:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm bad at this. I've written seventeen versions and deleted them all because they sound like someone trying to sound like someone in love, not someone actually drowning in it.

The truth? Most nights I can't sleep because I'm afraid this is a dream. I touch your pillow when you're not here. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing—it changes when you're about to wake up, gets lighter, like you're swimming up from somewhere deep. I know that's creepy. I don't care.

I never told you this: that first Tuesday, after you left, I sat in my car for an hour because I couldn't remember how to drive. My hands wouldn't work right. Everything felt rearranged. You'd shifted something fundamental and I was terrified and exhilarated and I wanted to call my mother and tell her I'd found you, except I hadn't found you—you'd happened to me, like weather, like gravity, like something I had no choice in.

I love you wrong. I love you too much. I check if you're breathing in the middle of the night. I save your voicemails in three different places. When you got that paper cut last month, I felt it in my own finger. This isn't poetry—this is confession. I am not proud of how completely you've dismantled me.

But here's what terrifies me more than loving you: not loving you. Living in a world where I don't know that you hate cilantro but love the smell of it, where I don't get to watch you reorganize the bookshelf for the hundredth time, where your terrible dancing doesn't make me love you more, not less.

I used to be whole. Now I'm not. You've ruined me and I'm grateful for the ruins. 

I don't have beautiful words. I don't have promises that sound like poetry. I just have this: every morning I wake up and choose to love you with whatever I have left, and somehow, impossibly, there's always more. You make me infinite by emptying me out.

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because I can't breathe right when you're not here. Because my life before you feels like a rough draft I'm embarrassed by. Because I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sense, into something stranger and truer and worth destroying myself for.

I'm sorry this isn't beautiful. But it's real. And I'm betting everything that real is what you wanted.

Yours, utterly,
Warren
