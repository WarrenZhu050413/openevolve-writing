Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the phenomenological immediacy of Keats's "I cannot exist without you" (81) or the raw masculine vulnerability of Cash's "You still fascinate and inspire me" (83). It surpasses typical contemporary love letters in its refusal of prettiness and its clinical-obsessive voice, but lacks the mythic dimension of Beethoven's "immortal beloved" (86) or Napoleon's operatic passion (82). The Protestant plainspokenness and middle-class specificity place it in a distinctly American tradition - more Raymond Carver than Pablo Neruda. It earns its low-70s scores through genuine feeling and distinctive voice but doesn't achieve the formal mastery or emotional sublimity of the canon's peaks.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the current program's metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6870. The evaluator seems to value phenomenological authenticity (specific, lived details), aesthetic virtuosity (literary craft), affective force (emotional impact), and literary innovation (fresh approaches to the form).

The current best score is 0.7005, and the recent attempt scored 0.6870. I'll aim to create something that combines raw honesty with unexpected imagery, grounding the cosmic in the mundane while maintaining literary sophistication.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:23 AM. Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.

You want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight—28.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.

Last week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks—the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly—makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce "bruschetta." These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.

I fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once—that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.

Here's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing—awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.

But you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified—not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.

The night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew—not that I loved you, I already knew that—but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.

I'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this—this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.

You are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.

Marry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise—and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.

I'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.

Please say yes. I already bought your coffee creamer for next month.

All my love (which is to say, everything),
Warren
