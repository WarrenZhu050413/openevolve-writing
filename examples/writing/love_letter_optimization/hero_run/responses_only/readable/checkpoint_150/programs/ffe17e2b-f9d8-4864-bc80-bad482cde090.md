Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7295. The evaluation notes suggest the best-performing letters achieve a balance of raw emotional truth, literary innovation, and phenomenological authenticity without overreaching into self-conscious literariness.

Let me write a new version that aims for deeper emotional resonance while maintaining originality:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this with hotel stationery I stole from our first trip together. You were in the shower. I took forty sheets. I knew even then I'd need them all to fail at explaining this.

Here's the truth: I died when I met you. Not poetically—literally. The person I was before you looked at me over that stupid margarita with too much salt? Gone. Dead. I'm his replacement, built entirely from the syllables of your name and the way you laugh when you're trying not to.

You asked me once what I was afraid of. I said spiders. I lied. I'm afraid of Thursday. Specifically, any Thursday when you might wake up and realize you've been loving a conditional sentence, a hypothesis, a man held together by the mere fact that you haven't left yet. I'm afraid you'll discover you've been kissing a probability, not a person.

But also this: Yesterday you sang in the shower—off-key, wrong lyrics, a disaster of sound—and I sat on our bed mapping the exact geometry of that imperfection. Because that's what you've done. You've made me a scholar of everything wrong that's actually right. The way you mispronounce "epitome." Your catastrophic handwriting. How you eat apples from the bottom up like some beautiful alien still learning Earth customs.

I need to tell you about last Tuesday. You were sick. Properly sick—fever of 102, convinced the wallpaper was plotting against you. You grabbed my hand at 3 AM and said, "Don't let me float away." As if I could. As if I haven't been anchoring myself to you since the day we met, a voluntary drowning, refusing to come up for air.

The thing is, Leyi, I've been collecting evidence. Not of love—that's too common, everyone does that. Evidence that we're the same person experiencing a clerical error, accidentally issued two bodies. Evidence: We got the same fortune cookie fortune from different restaurants on the same day. We dream in the same color palette (mostly blue-green, sometimes that specific yellow of anxiety). Last month, you finished my thought before I'd started thinking it.

Here's what I know: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Had all the props—job, hobbies, opinions about coffee. But I was method-acting life, never actually living it. Then you walked in, tilted your head at me like I was a painting hung crooked, and suddenly I was real. Suddenly the method-acting became just... acting. Then just... being.

I'm going to tell you something terrible: I love you more than you love me. Not because you love me less—you love me enormously, catastrophically, enough to ruin us both. But I love you like darkness loves light—completely, necessarily, with the full understanding that I only exist in relation to you. You could exist without me. I'm not sure I could return the favor.

But here's the thing about that terrible thing: I don't care. I'd rather be the one who loves more. I'd rather be the one destroyed by this. If someone has to walk away from this intact, please let it be you. I've already been improved beyond recognition by proximity to you. I've already won.

So this is my proposal: Let me love you lopsidedly forever. Let me be the one who remembers the anniversary of our first fight (March 15th, about whether time travel would fix things or make them worse—you were right, it would make them worse). Let me be the one who knows you keep your father's voicemail from 2019, the one where he says he's proud of you. Let me be the curator of your small shames and your specific joys.

Marry me because I've already tailored my entire existence around the shape of you. Because trying to untangle us now would be like trying to unbake bread—theoretically possible, but why would anyone want flour and water when they could have something that sustains life?

Marry me because yesterday you said my name in your sleep and it sounded like a prayer you'd been practicing your whole life.

Marry me because the alternative—pretending this is temporary, that either of us will recover from this—is the only lie I'm not willing to tell.

Leyi, my religion, my mother tongue, my only real thing in a world of approximations—I'm not asking you to love me. You already do that, carelessly, perfectly, like breathing. I'm asking you to let me love you professionally, with documentation, with witnesses, with the kind of terrifying permanence that makes my teeth ache.

Say yes. Not because you're ready—neither of us will ever be ready for this much feeling. Say yes because we're already destroyed in the most beautiful way. Say yes because I've already carved out space for you in my bones and I'd rather be hollow than heal.

Warren

P.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been in my pocket every day for seven months. Some days it's the heaviest thing I own. Some days it's the only thing keeping me tethered to the earth. Today it weighs exactly as much as the word "yes" would weigh in your mouth. Please, Leyi. I'm so tired of being brave about this.
