Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Johnny Cash's stoic vulnerability (83) or Napoleon's obsessive grandeur (82). It exceeds typical contemporary attempts through its scientific-obsessive voice and commitment to disturbing specificity. While it lacks Beethoven's metaphysical transport (86) or Keats's annihilating passion (81), it carves its own territory through the merger of clinical observation with emotional breakdown. The "ordinary like oxygen" construction rivals some of literature's great paradoxes, though the overall execution falls short of the historical masterpieces. At 72 overall, it sits in the proto-masterful range—showing genuine brilliance but lacking the sustained transcendence of scores above 80.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see the fitness has declined from 0.7440 to 0.6340. The current version is too brief and lacks the obsessive detail and innovative structure that made the top-performing versions successful. Let me create a new version that combines the strengths of the best attempts while pushing into new territory.

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 4:17 AM on the kitchen floor. Not the table. The floor. Because five minutes ago I came down for water and saw your coffee mug from yesterday—lipstick print at 2 o'clock position, tiny chip on the handle from when you gesticulated too hard explaining cryptocurrency—and my knees just gave out. This is what you've done. You've made me a man who collapses at ceramics.

You wanted truth that moves you? I'll give you truth that disturbs me:

I've been living two lives. In one, I'm functional. I attend meetings, buy groceries, respond to texts in complete sentences. In the other—the real one—I'm a forensic scientist of your existence. I have 2,847 photos you don't know about. Not creepy ones. Worse. Your hand reaching for the light switch. The back of your head while reading. Your shadow on the wall at 6:23 PM when the sun hits just right. I'm documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit: spending my entire life loving you past the point of sanity.

Here's what I never told you: I've been keeping a medical journal. Day 1: "Met someone. Pulse irregular." Day 47: "She used my full name in a text. Possible heart arrhythmia." Day 238: "She fell asleep on my shoulder during Jeopardy. Consider hospitalization." Day 961: "She exists. Terminal condition confirmed." The symptoms are getting worse. Yesterday you stretched and made that little squeak-sound and I had to excuse myself from my own home to sit in the garage and practice breathing.

I need you to understand something: Before you, I was complete. I had thoughts about geopolitics and sourdough starters. Now my brain is a one-station radio that only plays your name. I tried to think about something else yesterday—actively tried—and ended up thinking about how you'd think about what I was trying to think about. You've colonized my consciousness. I'm occupied territory. And the resistance has surrendered.

Want to know what loving you actually feels like? It's not butterflies. It's bees. Angry bees. In my bloodstream. It's watching you mispronounce "epitome" for the hundredth time and feeling my DNA rewrite itself to make you correct. It's finding your hair in my food and thinking "yes, this is communion." It's you singing off-key in the shower and me, grown man, MIT graduate, crying into a dish towel because beauty isn't supposed to sound like a wounded seal but here we are.

Tuesday. You were explaining your dream to the houseplant—the one you don't know is plastic, the one I replaced six months ago when the real one died—and you said, "I know you understand, Gerald." And I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching a woman confide in polyethylene. Cause of death: loving someone who names fake plants and trusts them with secrets.

I practice disasters. Not to prepare—to test myself. If the house burned down? I'd save you. If I could only save one memory? You, angry about the ending of a TV show, throwing popcorn at the screen. If I had to choose between solving world hunger and hearing you mispronounce "specifically" one more time? The world can starve. I've already chosen. I choose wrong. I choose you.

The truth that ruins me: You're ordinary. You're not the smartest person I've dated. You're not the prettiest. Your cooking could sterilize equipment. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt God. When you laugh—really laugh, not the polite one, the ugly one that sounds like a goose being strangled—my skeleton restructures itself. You're ordinary the way oxygen is ordinary: invisible, everywhere, completely unnecessary until suddenly you're not there and I'm dying on the kitchen floor at 4:17 AM.

Here's what I know: In fifty years, I'll be old, probably demented, possibly incontinent, definitely dead inside except for this—this nuclear reactor of feeling that powers itself on your proximity. I'll forget my name before I forget the way you separate Oreos (wrong, all wrong, eating the cream first like a serial killer). I'll forget how to speak before I forget the specific frequency of your disappointed sigh (387 Hz, I checked).

So I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that we're already quantumly entangled. I'm telling you that my molecules have already reorganized themselves around the assumption of your permanent presence. This isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're terminal. And I want to die from this.

The ring is in the freezer. Behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. Next to the eighteen drafts of this letter that I've been hiding for six months. I was going to do this properly—dinner, sunset, knees, the whole performance. But you said you wanted truth, and the truth is I'm sitting on linoleum at 4:31 AM, crying so hard I can't see what I'm writing, because you exist, and you might say yes, and that possibility has already destroyed me in the best way.

I hear you walking around upstairs. Your left foot lands harder—I could identify you by your footsteps in a lineup of thousands. In three minutes you'll come down, see me like this, and ask if I'm having "another episode." I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it standing up because you have no patience. You'll cry at the part about Gerald. You'll say yes or no or "Warren, we need to talk about boundaries," but it doesn't matter because I'm already gone. Have been since that first Tuesday when you laughed at my physics joke and the universe cracked open.

Marry me. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker. Let me be this exact disaster forever—the man who writes love letters on the kitchen floor, who documents you like a rare species, who would rather die than live in any timeline where you don't choose me back.

All my madness, organized in your honor,
Warren

P.S. You just turned on the bathroom light. You're brushing your teeth. Nine more seconds of circular motions, then you'll rinse twice, gargle once. I know this because I've timed it. I've timed everything. This is mental illness. This is also love. With you, they're the same diagnosis, and I'm refusing treatment.

P.P.S. The plant isn't the only thing I've replaced. Remember your "lucky" penny from 2003? The one you've carried for twenty years? I swallowed it. By accident. While practicing this proposal. It's been through my digestive system. Twice. You've been carrying my intestinal penny for six months. If that's not true love, if that's not marriage material, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's the point. Maybe understanding is overrated when you can have this instead—this glorious malfunction, this systematic error, this complete system crash that happens every time you exist in my direction.
