Evaluation Notes:
This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the raw emotional power of Beethoven's "My angel, my all, my very self" (86) or the elegant simplicity of Johnny Cash's fascination with June (83). It surpasses typical contemporary attempts through its unique systematic-obsessive voice, scoring higher than most modern efforts (typically 15-35 range) but falls short of historic masterworks. The data-driven romanticism is genuinely innovative, earning points for originality that partially compensate for occasional overreach. It's closer to a 74 than an 80 because while brilliantly conceived, it lacks the effortless mastery and emotional purity of the greatest love letters, which achieve more with less self-conscious cleverness.

Summary:
Looking at the evolution history and the feedback from evaluators, I can see the current program has declined in fitness (0.5825) from previous attempts (0.7440). The evaluators consistently praise obsessive detail, scientific/medical metaphors, and specific concrete moments while criticizing when letters become too abstract or lose their grounding in physical reality.

Let me create a new version that combines the best elements from successful attempts while pushing into new territory:

Letter:
Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this in the kitchen at 4:19 AM. The dishwasher just finished its cycle and keeps making that clicking sound you insist is morse code. I've been sitting here for two hours with a notepad, a calculator, and what's left of my sanity, trying to quantify something that breaks every time I measure it.

You wanted truth? I've been running experiments on myself. Documented. Peer-reviewed by no one. Subject: one man, age irrelevant, completely compromised by love. Method: expose subject to varying levels of Leyi. Results: catastrophic systems failure across all metrics. Heart rate baseline permanently elevated by 23%. Sleep efficiency decreased 41% due to "checking if she's still breathing" compulsion. New neural pathways formed exclusively for storing the way you pronounce "specifically" as "pacifically" when angry.

Here's what I've never told you: I hired a private investigator. On myself. To follow me following you. I needed proof I was as far gone as I suspected. His report, verbatim: "Subject exhibits signs of severe psychological dependency. Spent seventeen minutes in Target sniffing shampoos to find client's brand. Cried during purchase. Recommend immediate intervention." I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.

Truth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it—preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.

But here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like—circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.

I have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled "Tax Backup 2019." It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying "good morning" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled "how to be a father" four hundred times just in case.

You know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:
- "Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?"
- "Can you physically die from someone being too cute?"
- "Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?"
- "Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying"
- "Lethal dose of feelings"
- "How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia"

Last week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, "Look, he died holding her hand," and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.

The truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.

I'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.

But here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.

The sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.

Marry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.

Say yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.

P.S. The dishwasher just stopped clicking. Even it knows this is the moment. Everything knows. The kitchen tiles. The expired milk you refuse to throw away. That spider in the corner we've named Senator Legs. They're all waiting for your answer. No pressure, but the structural integrity of the universe depends on what you say next.

P.P.S. I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie). Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed. This is who you're marrying: a man who prepares for hypothetical futures with actual paperwork. God help you. God help us both.
