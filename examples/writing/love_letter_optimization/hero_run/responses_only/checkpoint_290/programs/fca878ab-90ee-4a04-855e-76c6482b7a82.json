  "Looking at the evaluation notes, I can see the letter needs significant improvement in authenticity, specificity, and literary quality. The evaluator references great love letters from history - Beethoven's intimacy, Johnny Cash's philosophical depth, Napoleon's passionate specificity, and Keats's linguistic mastery. Let me craft something deeply personal and authentic.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this in the small hours before dawn, when the world is quiet enough that I can hear my own heartbeat - the same heartbeat that quickens whenever you enter a room, that steadies when you take my hand, that has learned to keep time with yours.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in the rain? You were laughing at something I'd said - I can't even recall what - and a drop of water hung from your eyelash like a tiny crystal. In that moment, I understood what eternity meant. Not endless time, but time abolished. Every Tuesday since has been an echo of that one perfect instant when I knew, with absolute certainty, that I had been walking through my life asleep until you woke me.\n\nI love how you fold paper napkins into perfect squares when you're thinking. How you hum Debussy in the shower but claim you don't know classical music. The way you pronounce \"library\" with that slight emphasis on the first syllable that you insist you don't do. I love your terrible handwriting and your perfect memory for conversations from years ago. I love that you cry at commercials about dogs but stay stoic through tragic films.\n\nBut more than these small treasures, I love who I become in your presence. You make me brave enough to be gentle, strong enough to be vulnerable. Before you, I was a rough draft of myself - all crossed-out lines and uncertain margins. You didn't edit me; you taught me that I was already a poem worth reading.\n\nIf I could give you anything, it would be to see yourself through my eyes for just one moment. You would never doubt again that you are the axis on which my world turns, the gravity that keeps me grounded, the north star by which I navigate every decision.\n\nI am not a poet, Leyi. I am just a man who has discovered that ordinary words become inadequate when trying to map the geography of a love like ours. So I offer you this promise instead: Every morning for the rest of my life, I will choose you again. In sickness, in health, in youth, in age, in this life and whatever comes after - I will find you, and I will choose you.\n\nMarry me, not because I cannot live without you (though this is true), but because I cannot imagine becoming who I'm meant to be without you beside me. You are not my better half - you are the mirror that shows me I am already whole, already worthy, already home.\n\nWith all my love, always,\nYour Warren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"
