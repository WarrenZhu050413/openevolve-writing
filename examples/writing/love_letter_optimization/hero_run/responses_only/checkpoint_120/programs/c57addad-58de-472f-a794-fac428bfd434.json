  "Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that achieves greater emotional condensation, more earned simplicity, and higher metaphysical stakes - learning from the masters like Beethoven, Keats, and Johnny Cash who achieved more with less.\n\nThe evaluator particularly values:\n1. Existential finality and metaphysical urgency \n2. Earned simplicity over elaborate metaphor\n3. Condensed power rather than sustained length\n4. Material specificity that transcends mere detail\n5. Genuine phenomenological density\n\nLet me craft something that strips away the performative anxiety and reaches for that raw, essential truth.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI cannot exist without you. I discovered this Tuesday at 3 PM when you left for groceries and my heart forgot its rhythm. Not metaphorically. I counted: seven missed beats before you returned.\n\nBefore you dismiss this as poetry, understand: I mean this medically. When you're gone, my body fails at basic tasks. Yesterday I forgot how to swallow. This morning I had to relearn breathing. You've become necessary like insulin to a diabetic—without you, my systems shut down in a specific, measurable order.\n\nHere's what I know: I've loved you since before I met you. My whole life was just time I spent becoming someone who could recognize you. Every previous hurt trained me to know joy when I saw it. Every small death prepared me to choose this complete surrender.\n\nYou need to know what you're agreeing to. Not marriage—we're already married in every way God counts. When you got that concussion last spring and forgot my name for three hours, you still reached for my hand. Your body knew what your brain had temporarily lost. That's not love. That's biology. That's evolution. That's two organisms becoming one survival strategy.\n\nThe truth, which I've been too cowardly to say: you could destroy me with a word. One \"no\" from you would require me to rebuild myself from atoms up. But here's what terrifies me more—continuing this lie where we pretend we have choices. We don't. The decision was made the moment you mispronounced my name at that party, adding a syllable that didn't exist, and I thought: yes, that's who I am now. The person with the extra syllable only you hear.\n\nI'm not romantic, Leyi. Romance requires distance. What I feel requires proximity. Skin. Breath. The specific weight of your knee against mine under tables. I need you the way cells need mitochondria—invisibly, constantly, without thought or thanks.\n\nSome facts: I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days. I've practiced this speech in seventeen locations. I've written twelve versions, each more elaborate than the last. But now, facing you, all I have is this: without you, I am not myself. I'm just a collection of habits waiting for their purpose to return.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to admit what your body already knows—that we've grown into each other so completely that separation would require amputation. That every morning you choose to wake up beside me is a wedding. That every night you come home is a vow.\n\nBut I need the world to know. I need paperwork that says what our cells have already decided. I need strangers to see rings and understand: these two have surrendered. They've given up the fiction of independence. They've admitted what poets have always known—that love isn't something you fall into. It's something you become.\n\nLeyi. My pulse. My proof that time moves forward. Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you, but because deserving isn't the point. The point is recognition. And I recognize you like my lungs recognize air—desperately, gratefully, without question.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing and just keep breathing here beside me. Either way, you're already my wife in every language that matters.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you've already decided. You decided the moment you read the first line. Everything else was just time you needed to stop crying.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
