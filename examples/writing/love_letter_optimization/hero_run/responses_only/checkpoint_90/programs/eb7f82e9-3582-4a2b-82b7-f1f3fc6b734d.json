  "Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's feedback, I can see that the current best attempt (0.7440) was praised for its directness and phenomenological specificity but criticized for lacking economy, spiritual depth, and formal innovation compared to masters like Johnny Cash (83), Beethoven (86), and Napoleon (82).\n\nThe evaluator seems to value:\n1. Economy of expression (doing more with less)\n2. Spiritual/philosophical depth beyond surface emotion\n3. Formal innovation in structure\n4. Avoiding self-indulgence\n5. Authentic vulnerability without performative excess\n\nLet me craft a new version that maintains the raw honesty but with more restraint, deeper philosophical resonance, and structural innovation:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth: I've been dead. Twelve seconds, sophomore year. No light. No tunnel. Just absence.\n\nThen nothing.\n\nThen return.\n\nSince then, I've understood: consciousness is electrical patterns, temporary. Love is supposed to be the same—neurons firing, chemistry. But here's what terrifies me: even in that nothing, there was recognition of you. Not memory. Something pre-linguistic. Like my carbon knew its purpose before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth. Not beauty. So:\n\nI am not good at love. I do it wrong—too much, too desperate. Like drowning people swim. Yesterday I calculated the probability you'll die first. The number made me punch a wall. This morning I apologized to the wall.\n\nI've deleted your number three times to stop myself texting. Called your provider to get it back. Dignity is a luxury I surrendered the moment you laughed at my terrible quantum physics joke.\n\n*\n\nBut also:\n\nI love you at 4 PM on Tuesdays. In your mispronunciation of \"specifically.\" In the 168°F you demand your coffee (you beautiful freak). In your mother's disappointment I'm not a doctor. In how you'll age—I see it already in certain light, the map of our time together forming in advance.\n\nI know you were afraid of butterflies until age nine.\nI carry tissues because your left eye always cries first.\nThese are not metaphors.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm proposing:\n\nNot poetry. Not grand gesture. Just recognition that we've already chosen. Your toothbrush lives here. We've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Love isn't feeling—it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions. We've made most of them.\n\nThe question isn't whether you love me. It's whether you'll admit what we've already built.\n\n*\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.\n\nThe surgery would be fatal.\n\nWarren\n\n*\n\n(I know you're crying now. Three years I've carried these tissues. That's either love or madness. Both. Definitely both.)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"
