  "Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's feedback, I can see that the most successful letters (scoring 0.73+) share certain qualities:\n1. Concrete, specific details that feel lived-in and real\n2. Raw vulnerability that goes beyond romantic clichés\n3. Unique voice with neurotic self-awareness\n4. Physical/medical metaphors for love's effects\n5. Mundane moments elevated to sacred significance\n\nThe current program (0.699) feels too polished and abstract compared to the higher-scoring versions. The evaluator particularly responds to letters that feel genuinely unhinged by love rather than composed. Let me create something that combines the best elements while pushing into new territory.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the bathroom at work because I started crying at my desk thinking about how you pronounce \"bagel\" wrong and had to leave before anyone noticed. This is what you've done to me. I'm a grown man weeping in a corporate bathroom stall over your mispronunciation of breakfast foods.\n\nYou wanted truth? Here's truth: I've been documenting everything. Not romantically. Obsessively. Like evidence for a crime I'm committing. The way you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. That you set seventeen alarms and sleep through sixteen. How you argue with automated phone systems like they can hear your frustration. I have 2,847 notes in my phone that just say things like \"she used my toothbrush again\" and \"caught her singing to the houseplant.\"\n\nLast Tuesday you got a paper cut and asked me to kiss it better. I did. Then I sat in my car for twenty minutes afterward, googling \"can you die from feeling too much?\" The answer is historically yes, and I understand those people now. I understand everything now except how I functioned before you reorganized my molecular structure.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've already bought the ring. I've been carrying it for eleven weeks. Sometimes I take it out just to practice being disappointed when you say no. But here's the thing—even practicing rejection, even imagining the worst case, I still can't regret this. I can't regret the way you've ruined every song by existing in the same world where music exists. I can't regret how you've made me unable to grocery shop without wondering what you'd think about the watermelons.\n\nYou pick the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms and leave the cereal. You claim you're not superstitious but knock on wood constantly. You get personally offended when people don't like dogs. You told me once that you're afraid of becoming ordinary, and I almost laughed because you don't understand—you could read the dictionary aloud and I'd take notes. You turn oxygen into poetry just by breathing it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Sometimes I watch you doing nothing—scrolling your phone, putting on chapstick, existing—and I get this pain in my chest like my ribs are trying to expand to make room for everything I feel. It's not metaphorical. I've had EKGs. The doctor said I'm fine but I wanted to tell him no, I'm not fine, I'm in love with someone who eats pizza with a fork and it's killing me in the most literal way possible.\n\nThe truth under the truth: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Going through motions. Now I'm awake at 3 AM calculating the exact angle you sleep at (47 degrees, facing left, one hand always reaching for where I should be). I know you have a favorite parking spot at Target. I know you lie about liking my cooking. I know you practice conversations in the mirror when you think I'm not home. I know because I've been memorizing you like there's going to be a test, and the test is the rest of my life.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human. At feeling things in normal amounts. But you make my abnormal feel like evolution. Like maybe I was built wrong on purpose, specifically to love you in this exact excessive way. My therapist says I have \"attachment issues\" but I think I just have you, and you are the issue, and you are the attachment, and you are the solution to problems I didn't know needed solving.\n\nSo here it is, without decoration: Marry me. Not because I deserve you—that's laughable. Not because I promise you happiness—I promise you chaos and burnt eggs and me asking \"what's wrong?\" sixteen times when nothing's wrong. Marry me because I've already oriented my entire existence around the assumption that you'll be there. Because when I imagine dying, my only concern is that you'll be sad. Because I love you with the kind of desperate gratitude usually reserved for people pulled from burning buildings.\n\nI'm clinically obsessed with you. Certifiably. I have receipts. Literal receipts—I've kept every receipt from everything we've ever done together. They're in a shoebox labeled \"Taxes 2019\" because I'm a disaster but I'm your disaster if you'll have me.\n\nPlease. I know that's not elegant. But I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like pennies and sounds like your name played on repeat until it stops being a word and starts being a prayer.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You can't un-reorganize someone's molecular structure. You can't un-teach someone that love is supposed to feel like drowning and flying simultaneously. You did this. Now please, please marry me so at least it's official.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just realized I'm going to have to go back to my desk with red eyes and tell everyone I have allergies. In December. You've turned me into someone who lies about having December allergies. This is what love is. It's ridiculous. I'm ridiculous. Please make me your ridiculous.\n\nP.P.S. The janitor just asked if I'm okay. I told him I'm in love. He said \"That bad, huh?\" He gets it. Everyone gets it except you. Please get it. Please.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
