  "Looking at the evaluation notes, I see the letter lacks specificity, depth, and literary quality. The evaluator mentions how great love letters achieve intimacy through precise, personal details rather than generic declarations. Let me craft something more vulnerable, specific, and linguistically sophisticated.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are just shadows of what moves through me when I think of you. Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound carved itself into my bones. I catch myself smiling at nothing, just remembering. Or how you hold your coffee cup with both hands, like it's something precious, steam rising between us in the morning silence that needs no filling.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, declarations. But it's smaller than that, and infinite. It's how my breathing changes when I hear your key in the lock. It's the way loneliness has a different texture now—not emptiness, but the specific shape of your absence. It's discovering that my future tense conjugates only in plural: we will, we might, we could.\n\nYou've rewritten the grammar of my existence. Before you, I was a complete sentence. Now I know I was just a fragment, waiting for the conjunction.\n\nI'm terrified and certain in equal measure. Terrified because you hold my entire life in your hands without knowing it. Certain because there's no other way I want to live.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever—forever is just a word—but because I promise you this moment, and the next, and every small ordinary miraculous moment I'm given, choosing you again with each breath.\n\nWith a love that remakes me daily,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
