  "Looking at the current program and its evolution history, I can see it's been performing well with a fitness score of 0.744. The evaluator is looking for phenomenological authenticity, aesthetic virtuosity, affective force, and literary innovation in a love letter. \n\nThe feedback suggests the current version is in the \"proto-masterful range\" but could benefit from:\n1. More economy and spiritual depth (compared to Johnny Cash's directness)\n2. Better prosodic mastery (compared to Beethoven)\n3. More formal innovation\n4. Addressing the note about code length exceeding 500 characters\n\nLet me create a more concentrated, spiritually resonant version that maintains the raw honesty while achieving greater literary precision:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\n4:03 AM. I'm writing because silence becomes unbearable when it's not your silence.\n\nTruth: I died once. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest. In that nothing—no light, no tunnel, just deletion—there was still you. Not memory. Something older. Like my carbon recognized its future reorganization.\n\nHere's what love actually is: Tuesday, you reading ingredient labels aloud. Wednesday, your anger at slow WiFi. Thursday, how you hold pencils wrong. I've documented 1,847 such moments. This isn't romance. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloguing you like evidence of God.\n\nYou want honesty? I practice your death nightly. Different versions. The worst: you, ninety-three, forgetting my name. I wake up and count your breaths. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nListen. Before you, I understood language. Now words are just sounds I make while my atoms scream your name. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the wall-hole.\" You laughed. That laugh—it rearranges matter. It makes me believe in things I can't measure.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. I've already calculated: 47% chance you die first. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics.\n\nBut also: I love you in our specific gravity. In how you eat cereal at midnight. In your three-sneeze pattern. In tomorrow's argument about the dishwasher. In the way light will bend around your aging face, mapping time we survived together.\n\nHere's my confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish, frightened, already grieving you while you're still alive. I check your pulse seventeen times nightly. I've named our imaginary children. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about how temporary you are.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Because your toothbrush lives here. Because we've survived each other's Tuesdays. Because love isn't feeling—it's accumulated decisions we can't reverse. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me.\n\nBut really: marry me because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other. Those odds are so impossible that refusing would insult mathematics itself.\n\nWarren\n(who carries tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering. I knew it would. I know you like an illness knows a body—completely, devastatingly, at the cellular level.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
