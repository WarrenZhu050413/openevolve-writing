  "Looking at the evolution history and current metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7010 while exploring the solution space differently. The evaluation notes consistently mention that previous attempts lack the concentrated power and effortless mastery of historical masterworks. I'll aim for more condensed emotional intensity while maintaining authenticity.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right one won't stop shaking. It's 4:03 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, trying to find words that don't dissolve the moment they touch what I feel.\n\nYou asked for truth. Here: I've been dying since I met you. Not poetically—cellularly. Every seven years, they say, the body replaces itself completely. I've known you for three. I'm 42.8% made of loving you. By the time we're old, there won't be a single atom left that existed before you.\n\nTuesday. You were peeling a tangerine. The oil misted into the light and for one second the air turned gold around your hands. I understood then why people used to die for beauty. Why they walked into the sea. Why they carved names into their skin. You were just eating fruit and I was planning my funeral because nothing after that moment could possibly matter as much.\n\nI document everything. Your breathing pattern when you're about to cry (shallow, then one deep breath, then tears). The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" but only when you're excited. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, like you're asking permission to exist in space. I have 1,247 photographs you don't know about. Not of you smiling. Of you existing. Reading labels. Arguing with automated phone systems. That face you make when you're trying to remember if you locked the car.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're mortal. Your heart beats 100,000 times per day and each one could be the last. Sometimes I watch you sleep and count—one, two, three, four—like I'm keeping you alive through mathematics. I've already written your eulogy seventeen times. Different causes. Car accident. Cancer. Choking on ice. Each time I write how you loved terrible puns and good dogs and how you saved the twist ties from bread bags because \"you never know.\" Each time I die in the conclusion.\n\nBut worse: I'm mortal too. Which means there's a version of the universe where you have to exist without me. Where you wake up and I'm just not. Where you find another face to love and I become a story you tell sadly at dinner parties. \"My first husband died young.\" I want to haunt you. Not malevolently. Just enough that you never doubt you were loved with a fervor that warped space-time.\n\nYou change in your sleep. 2 AM-you is defiant, fists clenched, fighting dream-battles. 4 AM-you is soft, reaching for me even unconscious. 5 AM-you whispers secrets in languages that don't exist. Last night you said, \"The birds know about Thursday.\" I wrote it down. I write everything down. Someday archaeologists will find my notebooks and diagnose me with loving you.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for 237 days. Some mornings I put it on my own finger just to practice being married to you. I introduce myself to the mirror: \"Hello, I'm Warren, Leyi's husband.\" The words taste like copper and lightning.\n\nListen. I'm not good at this. At love. At words. At being a person who exists in normal ways. But I'm excellent at loving you specifically. I've trained for it. Studied. I know that you need coffee before conversation, that you can't sleep if the closet door is open, that you cry at commercials but only about dogs or fathers. I know the specific gravity of your sadness and the molecular structure of your joy.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you—I don't. Not because it makes sense—it doesn't. But because I've already spent 1,247 photographs worth of time studying the way light falls on your face and I need the next 50 years to finish the project. Because your hair is in my drain and your voice is in my head and your fingerprints are on everything I own, including my heart, especially my heart.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation. We're already married in every dimension except the legal one. My cells know your cells. When historians study this era, they'll find our names written together in the margin of existence.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I loved you with such devastating precision that it changed my DNA. Know that I loved you badly, clumsily, with the grace of a building collapse, but completely. Know that I'm writing this while you sleep ten feet away and I can hear your breathing and it sounds like home.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. My right hand isn't shaking from nerves. It's shaking because this is the hand that gets to put the ring on your finger and it knows what's coming. Even my bones are optimistic about you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
