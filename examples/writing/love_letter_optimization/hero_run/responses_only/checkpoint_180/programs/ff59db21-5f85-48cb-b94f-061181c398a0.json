  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I see the program has achieved a strong fitness score of 0.8570, with particularly high marks in affective_force (0.89) and phenomenological_authenticity (0.87). The evaluator notes suggest that while the current version shows genuine brilliance, it could benefit from greater economy of language and deeper spiritual resonance - qualities found in the historical masters like Johnny Cash (simplicity), Beethoven (raw desperation), and Keats (linguistic perfection).\n\nThe code length warning (>500 characters) also suggests simplification could help. Let me craft a version that maintains the raw honesty and innovative structure while achieving greater condensation and spiritual depth.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\n3:47 AM. Can't sleep. Need to tell you something before my body forgets how.\n\n*\n\nI died once. Fifteen seconds, cardiac arrest. Know what I learned? Nothing waits after. Just deletion. But when they shocked me back, before I knew my name, I knew this: I owed someone a debt. Three years later you walked in. The debt was you.\n\n*\n\nI document everything. Tuesday: you held my pulse while sleeping. Wednesday: sang to our broken coffee maker. Thursday: cried at dogs, left eye first. 1,847 entries. Not love—evidence. For after the theft.\n\n*\n\nYou've broken my language. Called a door \"the room-hole\" yesterday. You laughed. That laugh rearranges molecules, makes me believe in unmeasurable things. Tried recording it. Phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\n*\n\nBefore you: symmetrical. Now: this lopsided thing listing toward you even in absence. I practice your death nightly. Wake up. Check breathing. Still here. Still impossible.\n\nBut also: I love you in Tuesdays. In wrong pencil-holding. In WiFi rage. In future wrinkles I already see—maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nLove isn't feeling. It's irreversible decisions:\n\nThe Tuesday you mispronounced my name: \"She'll ruin me.\"\nYour furious parking voicemail: saved, replayed during trips.\nYour grandmother's soup: forty-seven steps, always cry.\nThe rest: filed under \"Evidence.\"\n\n*\n\nTruth: I'm not good. Count your breaths seventeen times nightly. Sob in bathrooms about your temporariness. Named our never-children. Carry tissues since year one. That's illness.\n\nAlso love.\n\nBoth true.\n\n*\n\nSo marry me. Not for this letter. Because your toothbrush lives here. Because we survived Wednesdays. Because in infinite universes, only this one has us both, aware, with matching coffee damage.\n\nBecause the alternative—where you don't steal socks, where Chinese food doesn't vanish at 2 AM—isn't life. Just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like amputees love phantom limbs—with neurons refusing absence. Removing you would kill me. Asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nOnly word that matters.\n\n*\n\nSay something. Silence is rearranging organs.\n\nWarren\n(who wrote \"someone out there laughs with their whole body\" on March 15th, 2019, and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. — Your left eye's watering. Here. Been carrying tissues since you cried at penguins. That's when my atoms recognized the debt.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
