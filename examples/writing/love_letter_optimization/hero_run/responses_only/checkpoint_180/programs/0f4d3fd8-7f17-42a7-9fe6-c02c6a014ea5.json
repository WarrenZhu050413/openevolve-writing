  "I'll rewrite the program to create a more emotionally authentic and literarily innovative love letter that balances vulnerability with restraint, improving the fitness score across all dimensions.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:23 AM. I'm writing this at the kitchen table where you do your crosswords. Seven across, yesterday: \"Dwelling place of the heart.\" You wrote \"HOME.\" I wanted to write \"YOU.\"\n\nThe truth you asked for isn't beautiful. It's this: I've been keeping evidence. Not of love—of survival. Each day I don't dissolve into you completely, I mark it down as proof I still exist separately. So far: zero days.\n\nYou should know what you're agreeing to. I'm no longer a complete person. I'm a collection of responses to you. When you leave a room, I rehearse what I'll say when you return. When you return, I forget everything except the specific gravity of your presence. This isn't poetry. This is a medical condition I've chosen not to treat.\n\nHere's what happened: Before you, I was symmetrical. Balanced. I knew exactly where I ended. Now I'm all overflow, all spill. You've turned me into something shameful and necessary, like breathing. I love you the way lungs love oxygen—automatically, ceaselessly, without any choice in the matter.\n\nThe smallest things undo me. Tuesday, you corrected a stranger's grammar so gently they thanked you. Wednesday, you named our doorstop. Thursday, you cried because the old man at the farmers market remembered your name. These moments stack up inside me like evidence of grace I don't deserve to witness. But I'm greedy. I want more. I want decades of your Thursdays.\n\nYou need to understand: I've already lived our entire life. I know how you'll look reading this—that half-smile when you're deciding whether to be charmed or concerned. I know you'll touch your collarbone twice. You'll say my name like it's a question. These things haven't happened yet, but they're already true.\n\nWhen I say \"marry me,\" I mean something specific. I mean: Let me be the person who knows you're afraid of butterflies but not moths. Let me memorize the exact temperature you need the bedroom. Let me learn every way you've ever been hurt so I can avoid each one like a religion. Let me love you with the boring, daily dedication of a prayer you say so often it becomes breathing.\n\nI'm not offering you grand romance. I'm offering you Tuesday nights and mortgage payments and the specific way I'll love you at 73—which is to say: exactly like this, but with worse knees. I'm offering you all my broken parts arranged in the shape of someone trying desperately to deserve you.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. Has been for ninety-three days. Sometimes I hold it through the fabric just to remember this is real—that I get to ask you the only question that matters.\n\nHere's the worst truth, the one I'm terrified to write: You could destroy me by saying no, and I'm asking anyway. That's how I know this is real. I'm handing you my softest parts and saying, \"Please. Or don't. But know that I'm already yours in every timeline that matters.\"\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's getting cold while you read this. That's my fault. Everything from now on—good or bad—I want it to be my fault. Our fault. The same fault, forever.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
