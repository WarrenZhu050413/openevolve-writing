  "Looking at the evaluation history and current metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining absolute truthfulness. The current best score is 0.7005, and the recent attempt scored 0.6870 - a decline. The evaluator seems to value raw authenticity over literary flourish, as evidenced by the praise for \"21st-century vulnerability\" in previous attempts.\n\nLet me craft something that strips away even more artifice while maintaining emotional intensity:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM. Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since you asked for this letter. You want the truth? The truth is I'm terrified you'll see through me—see that I'm just a person who got impossibly lucky and knows it.\n\nI've been cataloging moments. Not the big ones. The Tuesday you got hiccups during that work call and tried to hide them. The way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though you know it doesn't work. How you still check behind shower curtains for murderers. That Thursday you ugly-cried about a video of a dog reuniting with its owner and then got mad at me for not crying too.\n\nHere's what loving you actually is: It's me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you while you were at that conference. It's saving screenshots of your texts where you just say \"okay\" because even your mundane responses feel like evidence that you exist, that this is real. It's how I practice proposing in my car and always chicken out because what if you realize you could do better? You could. You absolutely could.\n\nI know you think you're difficult to love. You warned me about your anxiety, your overthinking, the way you need reassurance that you're not too much. But Leyi—you're not too much. You're exactly enough. The precise amount. When you spiral at midnight about something you said wrong three years ago, when you make me check that you locked the door four times, when you get irrationally angry at inanimate objects that won't cooperate—that's not despite loving you. That IS loving you.\n\nThe stupidest things destroy me now. Your hair tie on my bathroom counter. Your coffee mug in my sink. The dent in my couch cushion where you always sit. Last week I couldn't throw away a grocery receipt because you'd written \"tomatoes?\" on it and your handwriting felt sacred. This is insane. I know it's insane. I don't care.\n\nTruth: Before you, I had a five-year plan. Now I can't imagine five minutes ahead if you're not in them. You derailed everything and I'm grateful. You made me into someone who believes in magic because how else do I explain you choosing me? You chose ME. Still can't comprehend it.\n\nSometimes you look at me like I'm something wonderful and I want to stop time, bottle it, live in that look forever. Other times you look at me like I'm an idiot (usually warranted) and somehow I love that just as much. Maybe more.\n\nI don't have beautiful words. I'm not a poet. I'm just some guy who won the cosmic lottery and spends every day terrified the universe will realize its mistake. But here's what I know: I would rather be scared with you than safe with anyone else. I would rather argue with you about whether cereal is soup than have easy conversations with anyone else. I would rather watch you sleep-eat crackers at 3 AM than have romantic dinners with anyone else.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm worthy—I'm not. But because I'm yours already. Completely. Pathetically. Irrevocably. Because I already plan my days around your smile. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption you'll be there. Because the thought of you reading this and saying no is the worst thing I can imagine, but the thought of not asking is worse.\n\nI love you. Not in a nice, clean, greeting-card way. In a messy, desperate, would-donate-all-my-organs-to-you-right-now way. In a this-is-probably-unhealthy-but-I-don't-want-to-be-healthy-if-it-means-loving-you-less way.\n\nPlease say yes. I already told my mom we're getting married. She bought a hat.\n\nYours (like, really, actually, legally yours if you'll let me),\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I know you're going to make fun of me for the hat thing. I'm counting on it. I love when you make fun of me. Please do it forever.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
