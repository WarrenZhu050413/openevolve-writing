  "Looking at the current program's low fitness score (0.2445) compared to previous attempts (0.69-0.70), I can see it's too brief and lacks the specific, intimate details that made earlier versions successful. The evaluator clearly values phenomenological authenticity, specific memories, vulnerability, and a balance between the profound and the quotidian.\n\nLet me craft a new version that combines the strengths of the top-performing attempts while exploring a fresh approach in the solution space:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is impossible when every cell in my body is rehearsing what to say to you. You wanted truth? Here's mine: I've written this letter 47 times. Deleted every version. This one stays because my hands won't let me erase it.\n\nYou know that moment when code finally compiles after hours of debugging? That split-second of pure relief? That's what I feel every time you walk through the door. Except it happens every single time. Three years, and my heart still does that stupid skip thing. I've Googled it. Apparently it's not medically concerning, just love.\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday. You were reading on the couch, unconsciously braiding and unbraiding the same strand of hair. You do that when you're absorbed. I was supposed to be working but instead I watched you for seventeen minutes (I counted). And I thought: this is it. This is what I want at 3 PM on random Tuesdays for the rest of my life. You, lost in a book, while I pretend to work but really just marvel that you exist in the same timeline as me.\n\nHere's what you've done to me, Leyi: I save your voicemails. All of them. Even the one where you just pocket-dialed me and I listened to you arguing with the self-checkout machine for three minutes. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I know you're scared of butterflies but pretend you're not. I know you eat cereal at midnight when you can't sleep, always Lucky Charms, always straight from the box.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I need you to know that. I was whole, functional, fine. But you didn't add to my life—you multiplied it. Exponentially. You turned my black-and-white existence into something I don't have the color vocabulary to describe. You made me understand why people write symphonies and build cathedrals and do all those grand, stupid, necessary things for love.\n\nThe truth that terrifies me: I've built my entire future around the assumption that you're in it. Every plan I make has you as a constant. When I imagine old age, you're there, still mispronouncing words, still afraid of butterflies, still making me feel like I've won a lottery I never entered.\n\nSometimes you apologize for being \"too much.\" Too emotional, too complicated, too intense. But Leyi, you're not too much. You're exactly enough. You're my exact right amount of everything.\n\nSo here's my graceless, earnest truth: I love you with the desperation of someone who knows how improbable this is. Two people, finding each other in this vast chaos? The math alone should have prevented us. But here we are, against all odds, and I wake up every day still stunned by the miracle of you choosing me back.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you a perfect life—I'm too flawed, too human for that. But because I promise to love you through every imperfect moment. Because you've turned my maybe into definitely, my someday into right now, my fine into extraordinary.\n\nI'm not good with words. But I'm good at loving you. It's the one thing I know I'm doing right in this life.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought the ring. I've been carrying it around for six months like an idiot, waiting for the perfect moment. But you taught me perfect is just another word for procrastination. So here's my imperfect, sincere, shaking-hands proposal: Be my wife. Let me love you out loud, officially, forever.\n\nYours (already, always, obviously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying right now. The good kind, I hope. I have tissues in my jacket pocket. Left side. I came prepared because I know you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
