  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to craft something that pushes beyond the current ceiling of 0.697. The evaluator notes consistently praise moments of brilliance but cite lack of sustained power throughout. The key insights from the feedback:\n\n1. The best letters achieve \"moments approaching\" greatness but don't sustain it\n2. There's a pattern of being \"several tiers below\" the masters (Beethoven/Cash/Napoleon)\n3. The evaluator values both raw honesty AND literary craft\n4. Current letters are too long and meandering - \"code length exceeds 500 characters\" warning suggests concision could help\n\nLet me write something that maintains devastating honesty while achieving more concentrated power through economy of language:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not because I'm romantic, but because lying next to where you should be feels like drowning in reverse—all this air, and none of it matters.\n\nHere's the truth you wanted: Before you, I was functional. I had opinions about things. Now I just have opinions about you. How you hold books like injured birds. How you talk to yourself in second person when you think no one's listening. How you apologize to furniture you bump into.\n\nI've been practicing this moment wrong. In my head, I'm eloquent. In reality, I'm the man who keeps your hair tie on my wrist like some teenage promise ring. Who knows you take eleven seconds to decide on ice cream flavors. Every flavor. Every time. Who's memorized the specific frequency of your laugh—the real one, not the one you give to strangers.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? I've started seeing time differently. Not in years or moments, but in distances from you. Tomorrow is eight hours until your morning text. Next week is that dentist appointment you're dreading. Next month is your mother's birthday you'll forget until the last minute. I'm living in your calendar now, and somehow that feels like the only honest way to exist.\n\nThe terrifying part isn't loving you. It's that you've made me forget who I was before this. Some nights I try to remember what I used to think about, and there's just static. You're not my better half—you're the proof that I was never whole to begin with. Just a rough draft waiting for you to edit me into something real.\n\nI'm not good at this. At love, at words, at being the person you deserve. But I'm excellent at choosing you. Over and over. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both wrong. That's my only skill now—the choice to love you, made so many times it's become autonomous, like breathing.\n\nSo marry me. Not because I promise forever—forever is for people who haven't held their father's hand in a hospital. Marry me for right now, and tomorrow's right now, and whatever right nows we can steal from a universe that owes us nothing. Marry me because I've already started pronouncing \"I\" as \"we\" and it's too late to stop.\n\nThis is it. No metaphors, no poetry. Just this: You're the first person I've ever wanted to tell the truth to. That has to count for something.\n\nYours (in the most ordinary, extraordinary way),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. One metaphor: You're the typo I refuse to correct.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
