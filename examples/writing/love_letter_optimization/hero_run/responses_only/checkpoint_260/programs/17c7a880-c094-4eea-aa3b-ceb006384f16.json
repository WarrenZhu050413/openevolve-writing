  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I can see the program has been hovering around 0.697-0.703 fitness score. The evaluator seems to value authentic, raw emotional truth over polished literary artifice. The best-performing versions balance concrete specificity with universal emotional resonance.\n\nLet me craft a new version that pushes deeper into vulnerable authenticity while maintaining literary sophistication:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with the bedroom door locked because if you saw me right now—red-eyed, surrounded by crumpled attempts—you'd know the truth: I'm terrified of failing you. Even in this. Especially in this.\n\nYou asked for truth that would move you. Here it is: I don't know how to love you correctly. I only know how to love you completely, catastrophically, with the kind of desperate intensity that makes me check your breathing in the middle of the night to make sure you're still real. This isn't romantic. It's mental illness, probably. But it's also the sanest thing I've ever felt.\n\nBefore you, I had a personality. Hobbies. Opinions about things that mattered. Now I'm just a collection of moments that orbit around you: the way you bite your thumb when you're concentrating, how you smell like vanilla and anxiety, the fact that you've kept every movie ticket from dates we've been on stuffed in your wallet like evidence of something you're afraid to lose. I know because I do the same thing.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: Sometimes I resent you for how much I need you. For making me this pathetic. Yesterday I found one of your hair ties under my car seat and almost cried. Who have I become? Someone who treasures your garbage, apparently. Someone who's memorized the exact sound of your disappointment, the specific weight of your silence when you're deciding whether to forgive me.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me want to survive myself. Before you, I was cosplaying at being alive—showing up, performing wellness, fooling everyone except the mirror. Then you looked at me like I was worth looking at, and suddenly I had to become someone who deserved that gaze. Not better. Just more honest. More present. More likely to say the thing that scares me.\n\nI love you like a wound that won't heal. Like a chronic condition. Like something that happened to me rather than something I chose. When medical students study love, they should study mine—how it reorganized my entire molecular structure, how it made me allergic to any future that doesn't have you mispronouncing words with absolute confidence, you eating cereal at midnight like a feral cat, you touching my face in the dark just to make sure I'm still there.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then realize what you've done—shackled yourself to someone who loves you so badly, so messily, with such desperate animal need that it embarrasses both of us. I'm the man who saves your voicemails to listen to when you're in the next room. Who's already planned your funeral in seventeen different ways because my anxiety needs to prepare for every possible ending. Who practices proposing in the shower and still fucked it up when it mattered.\n\nBut I'm also the man who knows you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box. Who knows you're afraid you inherited his sadness. Who sees you flinch when people say you look like him, and loves you harder in those moments—not despite the darkness but because of it. Because you trusted me with it. Because you let me see the parts of you that aren't ready for public consumption.\n\nThis is what I'm offering: not a fairy tale but a documentary. Real life where I love you on Mondays when everything is hard. Where I choose you during every petty argument about the thermostat. Where I fail you in small ways and spend the rest of my life trying to make up for it. Where we grow old and strange together, and I still get stupid when you walk into a room at seventy-five.\n\nI'm not your soulmate. I don't believe in souls. I'm just the person who knows you organize your books by how they made you feel, that you test if pasta's done by throwing it at the wall even though it never sticks, that you're the bravest coward I've ever met—afraid of spiders but not of loving someone who's this much of a mess.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you—I can, it would just be grayer, quieter, less worth documenting. Marry me because when I imagine dying, the only thing that makes it bearable is thinking you'll be there, probably complaining that I'm being dramatic, definitely holding my hand anyway.\n\nI love you. Truthfully. Terribly. Without eloquence or elegance. Just this raw, unwieldy thing that makes me write love letters at 4 AM because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you:\n\nYou are the best thing I never saw coming.\n\nYours (pathetically, completely),\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not crying during insurance commercials? I've built my entire definition of tenderness around it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
