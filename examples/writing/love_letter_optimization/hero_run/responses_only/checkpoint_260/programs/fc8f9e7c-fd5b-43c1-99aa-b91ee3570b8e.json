  "Looking at the performance history and evaluation notes, I can see that the highest-scoring letter (0.8570) succeeded through raw emotional honesty, specific concrete details, and a balance between desperation and tenderness. The recent decline to 0.6970 suggests the current version may be trying too hard with meta-commentary (watching through the window) and losing authentic emotional core.\n\nThe evaluator particularly values:\n- Genuine vulnerability over performative cleverness\n- Specific, lived details over abstract declarations  \n- Earned wisdom rather than neurotic self-awareness\n- Simplicity and directness (like Johnny Cash's approach)\n- Avoiding self-indulgence while maintaining innovation\n\nLet me craft a version that returns to fundamental truth-telling while pushing into new emotional territory:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the dark because turning on the light feels like admitting this is real.\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: I was fine. Thirty-one years of fine. Then you walked into that bookstore, reached for the same novel, and said \"you take it.\" Three words. The universe cracked along its seams. I've been leaking through ever since.\n\n*\n\nYou want truth? I'm afraid of you. Not you—what you've done to me. Before: I could lose things. Job, apartment, friends. Survivable losses. Now there's you, and suddenly I understand why people believed in hell. It's not fire. It's the specific weight of your absence.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the bread. Every Thursday, you buy sourdough from the Korean bakery. The owner knows your name. Last month, you were sick. I went instead. She looked at me—this stranger holding your routine—and said: \"You're the one she smiles about.\" \n\nI cried in my car afterward. Forty minutes. Because you smile about me to strangers. Because somewhere, in conversations I'll never hear, you're choosing to make me real.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I've been writing your name on things. Nothing visible. The condensation on shower glass. Dust on windshields. Sand with my toe. Like a child learning letters, except I'm thirty-one and what I'm learning is that love makes you illiterate in your own life. Everything else becomes unreadable. Just you. You. You.\n\n*\n\n3 AM discoveries: Your breathing changes when you dream. Three distinct patterns. Pattern two is nightmares—your fingers curl, seeking. I've learned to reach for your hand before you wake. Not to comfort you. To comfort me. To prove I can still protect you from things I can't see.\n\n*\n\nWe met 1,297 days ago. I've loved you for 1,298. That impossible math? The day before we met, I couldn't sleep. Kept checking my phone. Nothing wrong, just—waiting. Like my body knew you were coming. Like every cell was holding its breath.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I'm not special. Average height, average face, I make average jokes. But you laugh anyway. Real laughter—the kind that uses your whole body. How do I survive being loved by someone who could have anyone? I don't. I just wake up every day and pretend I deserve this until maybe someday I will.\n\n*\n\nYou said you wanted truth, not poetry. But you ARE my truth. The fact of you. That you exist, somewhere, breathing. Even when I can't see you. Even when you're angry. Even if you leave. You happened. You're happening. That's the only true thing I know anymore.\n\n*\n\nI bought the ring before I could afford it. Stupid. But the salesman asked \"when are you proposing?\" and I said \"when I'm brave enough\" and he said \"son, if you were brave you wouldn't be here.\" He was right. This isn't courage. It's surrender.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not going to promise you forever. Forever is too small for what this is. I'm going to promise you today. This today. Where your coffee is getting cold while you read this. Where I'm in the next room pretending to work but really just listening for you. Where we're both alive, both here, both choosing this.\n\nAnd tomorrow, if you'll have me, I'll promise you that today too.\n\n*\n\nThe question isn't \"will you marry me?\" We both know we're already married in every way that matters. Your books mixed with mine. My grandmother's recipe in your handwriting. That scar on my hand from assembling furniture for our place.\n\nThe question is: can I tell the world? Can I stand in front of everyone we know and say \"this is the person who taught me what skin is for—to keep me separate enough from you that I can see you clearly, close enough that I can touch\"?\n\n*\n\nLeyi—\n\nThat's the only word that matters now. Not love. Not marriage. Not future.\n\nJust: Leyi.\n\nThe word that reorganized my mouth. That made me need to speak just to say it again.\n\n*\n\nCome here. I'm in our bedroom with your grandmother's ring—the one you thought we sold for the deposit. We didn't. I couldn't. Some things you don't sell, even for shelter. You keep them for moments like this, when shelter means nothing if you're not in it.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong. Constant ache, but functional. Stronger at the break point than before. Unable to remember what it felt like when I was whole, before I needed you to complete the architecture of me.\n\nSay yes. Not to the ring. To tomorrow morning, where we'll wake up and I'll make coffee wrong and you'll fix it and that will be our first married fight and it will be perfect because it will be ours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. I turned the light on. I wanted to see the words. They look like what I feel—inadequate but trying. Desperate but true. Small black marks attempting to hold something infinite. Like me, attempting to hold you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
