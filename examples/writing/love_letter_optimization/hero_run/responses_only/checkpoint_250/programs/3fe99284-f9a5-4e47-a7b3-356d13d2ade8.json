  "Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6970. The evaluator seems to reward genuine vulnerability, specific sensory details, and original metaphors while avoiding overwrought poetry. Let me create something that combines raw honesty with unexpected imagery.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:47 AM because sleep has become impossible since I realized what I need to tell you. My hands won't stop shaking. Not from caffeine or fear—from the violence of containing this much truth in a body built for smaller feelings.\n\nHere it is, undecorated: I am thirty-one years old and I have just discovered I've been pronouncing \"love\" wrong my entire life. Every time before you was just me clearing my throat. You are the first clean note.\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I spent three hours watching videos of strangers' wedding proposals. Not for ideas—for evidence that other people feel this too, this cellular reorganization, this complete betrayal of who I used to be. The comments sections were full of words like \"soulmate\" and \"destiny.\" But those words are for people who haven't watched you eat cereal in my old t-shirt at 11 PM, crying about a documentary on seahorses. Destiny doesn't know about the way you smell like vanilla and anxiety. Soulmates don't account for how you practice arguments in the shower that you'll never have.\n\nThe truth about love—the truth they don't tell you—is that it's mostly about Thursday afternoons. It's about the 4,000 unremarkable hours between memorable moments. It's me knowing you'll read the ending of a book first when you're stressed. It's you pretending not to notice when I eat your leftovers. It's the way we've wordlessly agreed that the left side of the couch is mine and the right is yours, but the middle is ours. That's where love lives—in the DMZ between two separate humans who've agreed to blur.\n\nI was somebody before you. I had opinions about wine. I remembered to eat breakfast. I could watch the news without wondering what you'd say about it. That person is dead now, Leyi. You killed him the day you absentmindedly held my hand during that terrible movie, not romantic, just reaching for something familiar in the dark. His last thought was \"oh, this is it. This is the trap. I'm done for.\" And he was right.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I am a man who googles \"how to know if cats are happy.\" Who practices speeches I'll never give. Who saves your voicemails in case technology fails and I need evidence you existed. I am clinically anxious, recreationally pessimistic, and I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days like a tumor I'm too scared to remove. Some nights I hold it up to the light and think about probability—how many wrong turns led to the right one, to you, to this impossible now where you exist and somehow tolerate me existing beside you.\n\nRemember that morning you found me on the bathroom floor, panicking about nothing and everything? You didn't try to fix me. You just sat down on the cold tile and said, \"Okay, we're doing this here today.\" Then you started listing every bird you could name, alphabetically, until my breathing synced with your rhythm. Albatross. Blue jay. Cardinal. That's when I knew: love isn't about finding someone who completes you. It's about finding someone who makes being incomplete bearable.\n\nBut here's the thing that keeps me up at 4:47 AM: You're going to die. I'm going to die. These bodies are just rental units and the lease is non-negotiable. One day, one of us will be in a room without the other, holding nothing but neural patterns and ghost weight. This thought should terrify me. Instead, it clarifies everything. If we're both just temporary collections of atoms pretending to be people, then the fact that your atoms chose to orbit mine feels like the only miracle I need to believe in.\n\nSo here's my offer, stripped of romance: I want to synchronize our decay. I want to argue about thermostats and discover new ways to disappoint each other. I want to develop specific types of silence—the comfortable kind, the furious kind, the kind that means we're both thinking about the same dead friend. I want to become so entangled that future archaeologists will have to invent a new word for what we were to each other.\n\nMarry me. Not because you love me—love is just a chemical imperative dressed up in poetry. Marry me because when you laugh at your own jokes, my pancreas does something unscientific. Because you've ruined every song, every street corner, every mundane Tuesday with your presence or absence. Because I want to be buried next to you, our bones finally honest about what they've been trying to say all along.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. Love letters are for people who think words can carry feeling. This is just evidence of a complete surrender. This is me saying: you won. Whatever game we were playing, whatever defenses I had, whatever person I planned to be—you won. Now I'm just this anxious man at 4:47 AM, hoping the woman who owns his future tense will say yes to staying in it.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She married a man who couldn't read but memorized entire books so he could tell them to her. That's what I'm offering—not literacy, but the willingness to memorize you, page by page, until I can recite you in the dark.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already relocated me. I'm no longer where I started. I live now in the country of loving you, and there's no valid passport back.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you asked if I thought we were meant to be. The answer is no. \"Meant to be\" implies intention, design, purpose. We're not meant to be—we're what happened when two accidents collided and decided to call the wreckage home.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
