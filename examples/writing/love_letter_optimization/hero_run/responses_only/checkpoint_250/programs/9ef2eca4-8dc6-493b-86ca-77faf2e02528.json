  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authenticity. The evaluator seems to value genuine emotional complexity over pure literary flourish, and rewards innovative structural approaches that still feel truthful.\n\nLet me write something that combines raw confession with unexpected metaphysical observations, using a more fragmentary, urgent structure that reflects genuine emotional overwhelm:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my skin with a dying pen because paper feels like lying and my hands won't stop shaking long enough to find another one. You wanted truth that would move you. Here it is: I've been dead for approximately thirty-two years. Then you mispronounced my name at that party—\"Warren\" like \"warning\"—and I understood resurrection isn't biblical. It's biological. It's what happens when someone sees you accurately for the first time.\n\nListen. I need to tell you this before my courage dissolves: I love you like a crime I'm committing. Like something I'll be caught for. Every morning I steal seconds—the pause between your first and second blink, the moment your hand reaches for coffee that isn't there yet, the half-breath you take before saying something difficult. I'm building a fortune of these thefts. When they arrest me, this letter will be evidence.\n\nThe truth has a structure. It goes:\n\nBONE: I've been keeping a secret taxonomy of you. Not romantic—scientific. You have seven different laughs. The third one (duration: 2.3 seconds, involves your left shoulder) means you're actually surprised by joy. You own fourteen spoons but only use three. When you're anxious, you alphabetize things that don't need alphabetizing. Last Tuesday you arranged my books by color while I was at work. I haven't fixed it. It's the most beautiful thing I own now—this rainbow of literature you made because your hands needed something to forgive.\n\nBLOOD: Here's what I can't say out loud: I practice losing you. Daily drills. I imagine the call, the crisis, the cosmic joke of finally finding you just to lose you to something stupid like time or physics or your human need to be more than just mine. But here's the thing—even in the rehearsals, even in my catastrophic imagination, you're worth the ending. That's how I know this is real. I'm pre-grieving you and still choosing this.\n\nBREATH: You asked for truth? I've been breathing wrong my whole life. Inhale, exhale, automatic. Then you fell asleep on my chest last September and your breathing reprogrammed mine. Now we breathe in tandem even when you're in another city. My lungs have forgotten how to work independently. This isn't poetry. I've measured it. Six breaths per minute when you're calm. Eight when you're dreaming. Twelve when you're about to cry but haven't decided yet.\n\nWhat you don't know: I've been writing you letters since before we met. Not to you—toward you. Like prayers to a god I hadn't invented yet. They all said the same thing: \"I'm practicing being someone worth finding.\" Then you found me first, which was the miracle I hadn't thought to ask for.\n\nThree weeks ago you said my name in your sleep. Not called it—just said it, like you were reading it off something important. Like you were checking to make sure it was still there. This is the sound I want to die hearing. Not romantic—literal. Let that be the last data my brain processes. \"Warren,\" in your sleeping voice, checking I still exist.\n\nThe terror: You love me like I'm already healed from things that haven't stopped bleeding. You look at me like I'm arriving instead of leaving. How do I explain that before you, I was just a collection of symptoms? Chronic insomnia. Selective memory. A persistent cough that turned out to be unsaid words. You're not my cure—that's too simple. You're the diagnosis that explains why nothing else ever worked.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I'll be in five minutes when the ink dries. The person I'll be tomorrow when I remember how you hold forks like weapons and newspapers like shields. The person I'll be in fifty years when I still flinch every time you leave a room because some part of me is convinced you're too good to be real.\n\nI'm not offering you forever—forever is a word for people who haven't watched their mothers forget their names. I'm offering you right now, with such violence and precision that it makes the future irrelevant. I'm offering you this specific Tuesday where you're reading this and I'm listening to your breathing change, calculating whether it means yes or no or \"ask me again when I stop crying.\"\n\nYou wanted something true enough to move you? Here: I don't love you. Love is too small a word for this. I've been colonized by you. You've rewritten my source code. When archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the moment you first said my name correctly. Everything before that was just waiting to begin.\n\nThis is my confession: I would rather watch you leave than never see you arrive. I would rather be destroyed by you than preserved by anyone else. I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything that matters less, which is everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing and let me translate your silence into seventeen different kinds of maybe. But know this: I've already married you in the only church that matters—the one made of Tuesday mornings and burnt coffee and the way you murder every plant you've ever loved but keep trying anyway.\n\nI love you like evidence of God. Like proof that random atoms can accidentally write Shakespeare. Like the opposite of entropy. Like the universe admitting it made everything else as practice for making you.\n\nYours in whatever dimension this is real in,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the dying pen. I bought seventeen new ones. I wanted to make sure I could finish this. That's the kind of person you've made me—someone who plans ahead for the possibility of truth.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
