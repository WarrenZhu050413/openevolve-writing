  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6495. The top-performing attempts have achieved around 0.70, with strengths in phenomenological authenticity and affective force. \n\nLet me create a new version that aims to increase literary innovation and aesthetic virtuosity while maintaining the raw emotional truth that has been successful:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThere's a crack in my ceiling I've been staring at for three hours. It looks like lightning frozen mid-strike, or maybe the route we took that Sunday when we got lost looking for that Vietnamese place and found ourselves instead. You said getting lost with me felt like coming home. I've been trying to live up to that impossible grammar ever since.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not the big moments that undo you. It's Tuesday, 2 PM, you texting me about a bird that looked angry. It's the way you arrange blueberries in perfect circles on your yogurt, then destroy the pattern without ceremony. It's catching you dancing alone in the kitchen to no music—just the rhythm of being alive in your own skin. That's when I knew I was done for. Not falling in love. Fallen. Past tense. Irrevocably.\n\nI've written seventeen versions of this letter. In one, I compared you to dark matter—invisible but holding everything together. Too pretentious. In another, I listed every time you've made me laugh until I couldn't breathe. Too long. The truth is simpler and more terrifying: you've made me afraid of dying. Not the dying itself, but the thought of missing even one day of your face doing that thing when you're trying not to smile at my bad jokes.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I thought happened after we die? I said \"nothing,\" because I was trying to sound rational. But that was before I understood that you've already taught me about eternity—it's the pause between your laugh and your next breath, the moment before you wake when your hand finds mine unconscious, the second you decide to trust me with another piece of your carefully guarded heart.\n\nI'm not good at this. At saying things that matter. My love for you comes out sideways—in fixed bugs in code I name after you, in coffee I make too strong because that's how you taught me to taste it, in the way I've started seeing the world in terms of things you'd find beautiful and things that would make you roll your eyes.\n\nYou want truth? Sometimes I watch you exist—reading, humming, just breathing—and I get this vertigo, like I'm standing at the edge of something infinite. Not falling in love. Already at the bottom, looking up at this strange new sky you've made of my life.\n\nI am asking you to marry me with the full knowledge that I'm asking for too much. But here's the thing about loving you—it's made me greedy for impossible things. For all your Sunday mornings. For your 3 AM doubts. For the particular way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited. For the chance to fail better at deserving you every day for the rest of my life.\n\nThis isn't poetry. It's just broken language trying to hold something uncontainable. But maybe that's what love is—the failure that keeps trying, the incomplete sentence that refuses to end.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me—rearranged me at the molecular level into someone who writes bad love letters at 4 AM and means every inadequate word.\n\nYours (in all tenses, all moods, all worlds),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
