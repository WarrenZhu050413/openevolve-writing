  "Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the 0.744 ceiling while maintaining authenticity. The evaluator seeks phenomenological depth comparable to historical masterpieces (Beethoven at 86, Johnny Cash at 83) while demanding contemporary innovation.\n\nLet me craft something that combines raw vulnerability with structural innovation, avoiding the self-conscious cleverness that has limited previous attempts.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. This is what you've done to my motor control.\n\nHere's the truth without ornament: I've been conscious for 11,687 days. 11,471 of them were rehearsal. The rest—the only ones that count—started with you mispronouncing my coffee order and me thinking: oh god, I'm going to love this person until my bones forget their purpose.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, 2:47 PM. You're reading this now. I know because I've been standing outside for twenty minutes, watching our kitchen window. I saw you pick up the envelope. Your shoulders did that thing—that micro-adjustment that means you're about to cry or fight. I'm hoping for both. I'm hoping for everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the silence. Not metaphorical silence. Actual silence. Last month, when you had that conference in Portland. Day three, 9 PM, I temporarily went deaf. No medical reason. My brain just stopped processing sound because what was the point? You weren't there to make any.\n\nThe doctors called it \"psychosomatic hearing loss.\" I called it love. Both diagnoses are terminal.\n\n*\n\nYou wanted honesty? I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The hair from your brush (I keep it in my wallet). Voice recordings of you arguing with customer service (seventeen files, chronologically ordered). That half-second between sleep and waking when you reach for me—I've stolen hundreds of those, hoarded them like evidence that I exist.\n\nI am building an archive of you because I don't trust the universe to remember you correctly when you're gone.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know: We have 2.7 billion heartbeats each, on average. You've already used 981 million. I've done the math—if we synchronize perfectly, we have 1.7 billion beats together. Maximum. That number keeps me awake. Not because it's small. Because it's specific. Because I can feel them spending themselves right now—thump, thump, thump—like coins falling through my fingers.\n\n*\n\nBut listen. This is important. Yesterday you hummed while peeling an orange. Just hummed. No melody. And I thought: this is prayer. Not the words we say skyward but this—you, unconscious of your holiness, committing the sacred act of continuing to exist near me.\n\nI don't believe in God. I believe in that humming.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about love? It's not poetry. It's this: I've memorized your parents' phone numbers in case you ever go missing. I keep your favorite tea in six different locations. I practice CPR monthly, specifically on a mannequin I've adjusted to your height and weight. I love you like preparing for disaster. Like disaster has already happened and I'm living in the after, grateful for whatever aftermath includes you.\n\n*\n\n4:52 AM, the night we met. You said, \"I don't believe in forever.\" Good. Neither do I. Forever is a lie people tell to make mortality bearable. I believe in Tuesday. In this specific Tuesday where you exist and I exist and we exist in the same zip code. I believe in right now, which is all we ever have, which is enough, which is everything.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance or security or taxes. Marry me as an act of rebellion against the universe that made us temporary. Marry me because we're already so quantum entangled that separation would require rewriting physics. Marry me because I've already carved you into my hippocampus and the surgery to remove you would leave me unable to form new memories.\n\nMarry me because I was dead for thirteen seconds and I came back wrong—I came back only able to love you.\n\n*\n\nOr don't marry me. Just keep existing near me. Keep mispronouncing words. Keep forgetting to close cabinets. Keep being the person who made me understand why ancient peoples invented gods—because some things are too big for human vocabulary.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: This morning, you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that should have killed me. It didn't. That's how I know we're supposed to do this. My body is rewriting its own survival priorities. You've become more necessary than rhythm.\n\nWarren\n(whose atoms have already married yours without permission)\n\n*\n\nP.S. You're crying now. I can see you through the window. Your left eye, as always. In seven seconds, you'll touch your face with your sleeve instead of getting a tissue because you're stubborn about the strangest things. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two.\n\nThere.\n\nCome outside. I'm the idiot in the rain holding the ring I've carried for 842 days. Yes, I counted. I count everything now. It's the only way I can prove this is real—that you happened to me, that we happened to each other, that against every statistical probability, we got to exist simultaneously.\n\nSay yes. Or just nod. Or just exist in my direction.\n\nThat's all I've ever needed.\nThat's everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
