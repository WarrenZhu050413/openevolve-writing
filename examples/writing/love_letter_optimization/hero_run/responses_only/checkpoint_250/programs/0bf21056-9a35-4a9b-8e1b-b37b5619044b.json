  "Looking at the fitness history and evaluation notes, I need to create a love letter that achieves greater condensed power and effortless authority. The evaluators consistently reference masters like Beethoven (86), Johnny Cash (83), Keats (81), and Napoleon (82) as benchmarks. The key criticisms are: trying too hard to be profound, lacking deceptive simplicity, and missing the existential finality of the greatest love letters.\n\nLet me craft something that combines raw honesty with earned simplicity, avoiding overreach while maintaining genuine innovation.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis morning you asked if I was happy and I couldn't answer. Not because I'm not—because \"happy\" is too small a word for what you've done to me. You've made me necessary. Before you, I was optional to my own life.\n\nI'm writing this at the kitchen table where you taught me to fold dumplings last week. You said the secret was to leave a little air inside \"so they have room to become themselves.\" I've been thinking about that. How you always leave room for things to become. How you left room for me.\n\nThe truth: I don't know how to love you correctly. I love you like a broken faucet—too much, all at once, making a mess. Yesterday you found the folder where I save your voicemails and you laughed, but Leyi, those eight seconds of you saying \"hey, it's me\" have talked me out of sadness more times than I can count. Is that crazy? Everything about loving you feels crazy. Like trying to explain water to someone who's never been thirsty.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified. Not of commitment. Of not being enough. Of you realizing that I'm just a man who counts your breaths when you sleep, who knows you need exactly four ice cubes in your coffee, who has memorized the specific pause you take before lying. I know too much about you to pretend this is casual, and not enough to guarantee I won't fail you.\n\nBut here's what I know: When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim by about thirty percent. My own name sounds wrong in my mouth. I don't just miss you—I miss myself when you're near. The version of me that exists in your presence is the only one I want to be.\n\nRemember that fight about the dishes? You said I was \"pathologically unable to let things soak.\" You were right. But you stayed. You stayed and we made pasta at midnight and you kissed me with tomato sauce on your lips and I thought: this is what marriage is. Not the big moments. This. Tomato sauce and forgiveness and choosing to stay.\n\nI used to think I understood my life. Beginning, middle, eventual end. Then you happened, and now there's only before you and since you. No after. My brain won't process after.\n\nSo I'm asking you to marry me. Not because I deserve you—I don't. Not because it makes sense—it doesn't. But because you already live in my cells. Because when doctors ask about family medical history, I want to include yours. Because \"girlfriend\" is too small a word for someone who has seen me ugly-cry at a dog adoption commercial and still chooses to wake up beside me.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived my mother, your ex, food poisoning from that sketchy Thai place, and assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. We're battle-tested, Leyi. We've earned this.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because twenty years from now, I want to be arguing with you about how to load the dishwasher, and I want to be wrong, and I want you to kiss me anyway, and I want to think: yes, this, forever this, only this.\n\nI love you. Simply. Completely. Permanently.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I've been carrying this question in my throat for months. Please say yes. I'm running out of places to hide things from you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
