In that nothing\u2014no light, no tunnel, just deletion\u2014there was still you. Not memory. Something older. Like my carbon recognized its future reorganization.\n\nHere's what love actually is: Tuesday, you reading ingredient labels aloud. Wednesday, your anger at slow WiFi. Thursday, how you hold pencils wrong. I've documented 1,847 such moments. This isn't romance. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloguing you like evidence of God.\n\nYou want honesty? I practice your death nightly. Different versions. The worst: you, ninety-three, forgetting my name. I wake up and count your breaths. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nListen. Before you, I understood language. Now words are just sounds I make while my atoms scream your name. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the wall-hole.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014it rearranges matter. It makes me believe in things I can't measure.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. I've already calculated: 47% chance you die first. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics.\n\nBut also: I love you in our specific gravity. In how you eat cereal at midnight. In your three-sneeze pattern. In tomorrow's argument about the dishwasher. In the way light will bend around your aging face, mapping time we survived together.\n\nHere's my confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish, frightened, already grieving you while you're still alive. I check your pulse seventeen times nightly. I've named our imaginary children. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about how temporary you are.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Because your toothbrush lives here. Because we've survived each other's Tuesdays. Because love isn't feeling\u2014it's accumulated decisions we can't reverse. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me.\n\nBut really: marry me because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other. Those odds are so impossible that refusing would insult mathematics itself.\n\nWarren\n(who carries tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering.

It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.

I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language.

So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.\n\nMarry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under\u2014the one you said looked lonely.

Here\u2014take it:\n\nI am thirty-one years old and have been dying since the moment I understood you could die first. This is not metaphor. My cells literally age faster from the stress of loving you. Scientists would call it oxidative damage. I call it the price of admission.\n\nLet me be precise: At 11:43 PM on a Thursday you don't remember, you fell asleep with your hand on my chest. Your fingers twitched\u2014dream movements, synaptic ghosts. In that twitch I saw our whole arc: meeting, marriage, children, aging, one of us watching the other stop breathing. The entire story, compressed into two seconds of involuntary muscle spasm. I stayed awake until dawn, counting your heartbeats like a rosary against the dark.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I rehearsed your name 10,000 times before we met. Not knowing you existed, just the shape of you, the you-shaped hole in language that needed filling. Every girlfriend before you was practice. I loved them like learning scales before playing Chopin. Forgive me. Or don't. The truth doesn't require absolution.\n\nHere: more truth. When you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one, but the one that breaks out of you like an escaped prisoner\u2014my amygdala floods with the same chemicals our ancestors felt seeing the sun after winter. Evolutionary biology reducing us to chemistry. But also: transcendence. Both true. The paradox of meat that dreams.\n\nI've done the math. If we're lucky: 19,710 days. If typical: 14,600. If the universe is cruel: countless variations of less. I lose fourteen minutes of sleep per night calculating probabilities. Those stolen minutes add up to three months of consciousness I've sacrificed to anxiety about losing you. The irony is perfect and terrible.\n\nBut listen\u2014this is important\u2014I choose it. The shortened telomeres, the cardiovascular damage from chronic worry, the neurons worn smooth from repetitive fear. I choose the biological degradation of loving you over the pristine preservation of not loving you. I would rather burn down to ash in fifty years with you than last a century as museum-quality loneliness.\n\nYou think I'm romantic. I'm not. I'm a pragmatist who did the cost-benefit analysis and discovered that a life without you is technically longer but functionally pointless. Like a heart that keeps beating after brain death. Medically alive, philosophically extinct.\n\nYesterday you used the word \"sonder\"\u2014the realization that everyone has a life as complex as yours. But you're wrong about me. My life isn't complex. It's binary. You/not-you. Together/apart. Breathing/drowning. The simplicity is humiliating. I had ambitions once. Now I have you. The trade wasn't fair to my former self, but he's dead now anyway, murdered by the first time you said my name correctly.\n\nMarry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word, like calling the ocean \"damp.\" Marry me because I've already paid the cellular price. Because my hippocampus has restructured itself around your presence. Because divorce would require literal brain surgery.\n\nMarry me because Tuesday you said \"we need milk\" and I heard \"we.\" Just \"we.\" The casual assumption of continued shared existence. That pronoun was a prophecy and a promise and I built a cathedral around it in my head.\n\nMarry me because I know you read the last page of books first, terrified of unhappy endings. I can't promise happy. I can promise this: however it ends, I'll make sure you're not alone for it. Even if I have to haunt you. Especially then.\n\nHere's the ring: my grandmother's, stolen from my mother's jewelry box. She'll forgive me when she meets you. Everyone forgives everything when they meet you. It's a superpower you don't know you have.\n\nThe stone is flawed\u2014a carbon impurity that jewelers call a \"cloud.\" Perfect. We're all just carbon, temporarily arranged into consciousness, clouded with the defect of knowing we're temporary. Wear it as a reminder that even our flaws are made of stars.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours at the molecular level. The decision is just paperwork for the atoms.\n\nWarren\n(who would marry you in every parallel universe, including the ones where we're different species)\n\nP.S. I lied. This is the eighteenth draft. The others were prettier but less true. You wanted truth. This is what truth looks like: ugly and luminous and irreversible as fusion. Handle with care. Or don't.

Tuesday, 9:47 PM: you sneezed mid-kiss. Wednesday, 2:15 AM: you said my name in your sleep like casting a spell. Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle. The way your spine curves slightly left when you're thinking hard. How your pupils dilate 2.3mm when you see dogs. I measure these things. I have spreadsheets. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm a case study in loving you wrong.\n\nBut also: when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one for strangers\u2014the sound reorganizes my DNA. I've tried to record it 1,247 times. The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.\n\n*\n\nThe mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:\n\nYour coffee: 167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.\nYour sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.\nYour tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.\nYour anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.\n\nI love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead.

That means you're about to cry.\n\n*\n\nI could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower\u2014yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine\u2014isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date, when you cried at that documentary about penguins. I knew then. I've known for 1,462 days.

It's the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited, that little 'pacific' that somehow contains entire oceans. It's how you eat ice cream in winter because \"temperature is just a social construct,\" then steal my jacket anyway. It's the seventeen seconds every morning between when I wake and when I remember you're real, and how those seventeen seconds of forgetting make the remembering feel like winning the universe on repeat.\n\nI've been keeping inventory. Your laugh has forty-three distinct variations\u2014I've catalogued them all. The quiet library giggle. The sudden bark when I say something unexpectedly absurd. That rolling thunder when joy completely overtakes you. Number thirty-seven is my favorite: the silent shoulder-shake when you're trying not to wake me, not knowing I'm already awake, memorizing the rhythm of your happiness.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter 200 times in my head, deleted 199 for containing the word \"soul.\" I'm terrified that I love you more than you love me, and equally terrified of the opposite. When you had the flu last March, I googled \"can you die from someone else's fever\" because your suffering felt like mine but worse\u2014mine I could bear, yours rewired my understanding of unbearable.\n\nBut here's the thing about truth\u2014it's smaller than we think. It's not \"I would die for you\" (though I would). It's \"I'll kill the spiders even though I'm also afraid.\" It's not \"you complete me.\" It's \"before you, I never noticed I was incomplete.\" It's this: when I imagine different futures, you're the only constant that doesn't feel like a limitation but like the opposite\u2014like suddenly having infinite variables because with you, even the ordinary becomes unprecedented.\n\nI could tell you about the Sunday you cried at the ending of that ridiculous movie about penguins, how your empathy for animated birds made me want to be worthy of living on the same planet. I could map the constellation of freckles on your left shoulder (Orion's belt, but better). I could confess that I've already planned our arguments twenty years from now, and how even in imagination, your angry face makes me want to kiss you until we forget what we were fighting about.\n\nInstead, I'll tell you this: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity, or the speed of light\u2014something fundamental that doesn't require belief to be true. I love you at the quantum level, where observation changes everything and nothing simultaneously. I love you past the heat death of the universe, which sounds like hyperbole but feels like underselling it.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know that tomorrow without you is just time, not a future.

Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things.

Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me.

In the way light will bend around your aging face, mapping time we survived together.\n\nHere's my confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish, frightened, already grieving you while you're still alive.
