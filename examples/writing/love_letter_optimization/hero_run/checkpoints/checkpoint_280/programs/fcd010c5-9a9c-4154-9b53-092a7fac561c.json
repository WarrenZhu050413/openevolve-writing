My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork.

It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG.

Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services.

You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me. That's what you've reduced me to. And I'd choose this reduction again in every possible universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7440)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the kitchen at 4:19 AM. The dishwasher just finished its cycle and keeps making that clicking sound you insist is morse code. I've been sitting here for two hours with a notepad, a calculator, and what's left of my sanity, trying to quantify something that breaks every time I measure it.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been running experiments on myself. Documented. Peer-reviewed by no one. Subject: one man, age irrelevant, completely compromised by love. Method: expose subject to varying levels of Leyi. Results: catastrophic systems failure across all metrics. Heart rate baseline permanently elevated by 23%. Sleep efficiency decreased 41% due to \"checking if she's still breathing\" compulsion. New neural pathways formed exclusively for storing the way you pronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when angry.\n\nHere's what I've never told you: I hired a private investigator. On myself. To follow me following you. I needed proof I was as far gone as I suspected. His report, verbatim: \"Subject exhibits signs of severe psychological dependency. Spent seventeen minutes in Target sniffing shampoos to find client's brand. Cried during purchase. Recommend immediate intervention.\" I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.\n\nTruth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The dishwasher just stopped clicking. Even it knows this is the moment. Everything knows. The kitchen tiles. The expired milk you refuse to throw away. That spider in the corner we've named Senator Legs. They're all waiting for your answer. No pressure, but the structural integrity of the universe depends on what you say next.\n\nP.P.S. I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie). Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed. This is who you're marrying: a man who prepares for hypothetical futures with actual paperwork. God help you. God help us both.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: Migrant)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6185, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. I've started this letter nineteen times. The crumpled pages around me are proof that truth is harder than poetry.\n\nHere's what I cannot say out loud: I am broken without you. Not poetically broken. Actually broken. Like last Tuesday when you went to visit your sister and I stood in our kitchen at 2 AM eating cereal from the box because making a bowl felt pointless if you weren't there to steal bites from it.\n\nI'm supposed to tell you how you complete me, but that's backwards. You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.\n\nDo you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.\n\nThat's disgusting. I know. But it's true.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.\n\nThis is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop. Because here's the worst part: I would rather scare you away with too much honesty than trick you into staying with too little.\n\nI need you to know - not think, not hope, but KNOW - that you are not my better half. You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.\n\nI will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.\n\nI am terrified you'll say no. I am more terrified of never asking.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6295, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are insufficient vessels for what moves through me when I think of you.

The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped\u2014that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I carry it like a photograph in my chest, warm and constant.\n\nI love the small infinities of you: how you bite your lower lip when concentrating, the way you unconsciously hum Debussy while cooking, your habit of saving the last bite of dessert \"for later\" though later never comes.

I could spend lifetimes cataloging the specific gravity of your presence\u2014how rooms reorganize themselves around you, how even my anxieties grow quiet in your orbit.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor.
