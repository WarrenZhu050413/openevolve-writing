You wanted truth that would move you. Here it is: I've been dead for approximately thirty-two years. Then you mispronounced my name at that party\u2014\"Warren\" like \"warning\"\u2014and I understood resurrection isn't biblical. It's biological. It's what happens when someone sees you accurately for the first time.\n\nListen. I need to tell you this before my courage dissolves: I love you like a crime I'm committing. Like something I'll be caught for. Every morning I steal seconds\u2014the pause between your first and second blink, the moment your hand reaches for coffee that isn't there yet, the half-breath you take before saying something difficult. I'm building a fortune of these thefts. When they arrest me, this letter will be evidence.\n\nThe truth has a structure. It goes:\n\nBONE: I've been keeping a secret taxonomy of you. Not romantic\u2014scientific. You have seven different laughs. The third one (duration: 2.3 seconds, involves your left shoulder) means you're actually surprised by joy. You own fourteen spoons but only use three. When you're anxious, you alphabetize things that don't need alphabetizing. Last Tuesday you arranged my books by color while I was at work. I haven't fixed it. It's the most beautiful thing I own now\u2014this rainbow of literature you made because your hands needed something to forgive.\n\nBLOOD: Here's what I can't say out loud: I practice losing you. Daily drills. I imagine the call, the crisis, the cosmic joke of finally finding you just to lose you to something stupid like time or physics or your human need to be more than just mine. But here's the thing\u2014even in the rehearsals, even in my catastrophic imagination, you're worth the ending. That's how I know this is real. I'm pre-grieving you and still choosing this.\n\nBREATH: You asked for truth? I've been breathing wrong my whole life. Inhale, exhale, automatic. Then you fell asleep on my chest last September and your breathing reprogrammed mine. Now we breathe in tandem even when you're in another city. My lungs have forgotten how to work independently. This isn't poetry. I've measured it. Six breaths per minute when you're calm. Eight when you're dreaming. Twelve when you're about to cry but haven't decided yet.\n\nWhat you don't know: I've been writing you letters since before we met. Not to you\u2014toward you. Like prayers to a god I hadn't invented yet. They all said the same thing: \"I'm practicing being someone worth finding.\" Then you found me first, which was the miracle I hadn't thought to ask for.\n\nThree weeks ago you said my name in your sleep. Not called it\u2014just said it, like you were reading it off something important. Like you were checking to make sure it was still there. This is the sound I want to die hearing. Not romantic\u2014literal. Let that be the last data my brain processes. \"Warren,\" in your sleeping voice, checking I still exist.\n\nThe terror: You love me like I'm already healed from things that haven't stopped bleeding. You look at me like I'm arriving instead of leaving. How do I explain that before you, I was just a collection of symptoms? Chronic insomnia. Selective memory. A persistent cough that turned out to be unsaid words. You're not my cure\u2014that's too simple. You're the diagnosis that explains why nothing else ever worked.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I'll be in five minutes when the ink dries. The person I'll be tomorrow when I remember how you hold forks like weapons and newspapers like shields. The person I'll be in fifty years when I still flinch every time you leave a room because some part of me is convinced you're too good to be real.\n\nI'm not offering you forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't watched their mothers forget their names. I'm offering you right now, with such violence and precision that it makes the future irrelevant. I'm offering you this specific Tuesday where you're reading this and I'm listening to your breathing change, calculating whether it means yes or no or \"ask me again when I stop crying.\"\n\nYou wanted something true enough to move you? Here: I don't love you. Love is too small a word for this. I've been colonized by you. You've rewritten my source code. When archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the moment you first said my name correctly. Everything before that was just waiting to begin.\n\nThis is my confession: I would rather watch you leave than never see you arrive. I would rather be destroyed by you than preserved by anyone else. I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything that matters less, which is everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing and let me translate your silence into seventeen different kinds of maybe. But know this: I've already married you in the only church that matters\u2014the one made of Tuesday mornings and burnt coffee and the way you murder every plant you've ever loved but keep trying anyway.\n\nI love you like evidence of God. Like proof that random atoms can accidentally write Shakespeare. Like the opposite of entropy. Like the universe admitting it made everything else as practice for making you.\n\nYours in whatever dimension this is real in,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the dying pen. I bought seventeen new ones. I wanted to make sure I could finish this.

I had a credit score and opinions about mattress firmness. But that person feels like someone I read about once\u2014plausible but theoretical. You didn't save me. You revealed that I needed saving, which is crueler and more necessary.\n\n4:17 AM: You talk in your sleep. Not words\u2014pre-words, like language before it hardens into meaning. I've been translating. So far I have: \"The door isn't real\" and \"Tuesdays are heavier than Wednesdays\" and my name, said like an accusation.

You've made me unprofessional at my own life.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a diagnosis I'm afraid to confirm. Like those three seconds between dropping something fragile and finding out if it broke. You've become the margin of error in every calculation, the variable that makes all my proofs unsolvable. I used to be good at math.\n\nTuesday: Watched you eat an apple while reading. You bit in rhythm with the sentences. Short sentence, small bite. Long sentence, bigger bite. You were unconsciously synchronized with Virginia Woolf. This is the exact moment I understood religion\u2014not the comfort kind, the terror kind. The kind that makes you want to build cathedrals or burn them down.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in seventeen different ways. Legally?

Now I can't even grocery shop without it becoming an act of devotion. I buy the expensive tomatoes you like. I avoid the cereal aisle because you cried there once, exhausted and human and perfect, because we'd fought about something so stupid I can't even remember what, only that making you cry felt like breaking my own bones.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you wrong. I love you like an amateur\u2014desperately, sloppily, without technique. I check your breathing at night like a new parent.

But it's also the truest thing I've ever been.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too obvious. What terrifies me is that you've made me someone who cannot be satisfied with less than this specific frequency of morning, where you put too much cream in your coffee and defend it like a dissertation. You've ruined me for every alternate timeline where we're strangers passing in some other life's grocery store, both buying the wrong tomatoes, neither of us crying in the cereal aisle.\n\nI used to think my life was a rough draft. Turns out it was just the margins\u2014all the space waiting for your annotations.

Perfect would be easier to survive. I love you because you eat yogurt with a fork when all the spoons are dirty. Because you name your bruises. Because when you're happy, really happy, you look surprised by it, like joy is a bird that accidentally flew in through an open window and you're trying not to move so it won't leave.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in every action\u2014in the way I buy coffee filters we don't need because running out would mean you'd have to drink tea. In how I've memorized seventeen different ways to make you laugh, catalogued by severity of bad day. In the muscle memory of leaving space for you in bed even when you're not there.\n\nSo here's my offer, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Let me love you badly forever rather than perfectly for a while. Let me make the same mistakes until they become our traditions. Let me wake up every day and re-learn your face like it's a language I'm not fluent in yet but desperately need to speak.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you?

The ceremony happens every morning at 6:17 when you make that small sound\u2014not quite a sigh, not quite a hum\u2014that means you're deciding whether to wake up or wage war against consciousness for five more minutes. I pronounce us married then. The universe officates. Your breathing is the only witness we need.\n\nNow the middle: I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But I was wrong about the math. Love is division\u2014I've been split open, and everything I was certain about has fallen out. Yesterday I found myself crying in the produce section because the bruised peaches reminded me of your knee that time you fell off your bike trying to prove you could ride with no hands. This is what you've done: made me unable to look at damaged fruit without thinking about mortality and mercy and the specific weight of your body against mine when you're too tired to pretend you're not tired.\n\nHere's what I need to tell you before the beginning: I love you like a medical emergency. Not romantic\u2014literal. My body has reorganized itself around the fact of you. My circadian rhythm now matches yours. My left hand has developed muscle memory for the curve of your hip. When you're gone, my skeleton doesn't know how to arrange itself. I become architecturally unsound.\n\nThe truth has three parts:\n\nFirst: I document you compulsively. Not in photos\u2014in cellular memory. The way you murder pronunciation of \"worcestershire.\" How you arrange pills by size, not schedule. Your vendetta against fitted sheets. The surgical precision with which you remove tomatoes from sandwiches. I'm building an encyclopedia of you, but it's written in a language only my body knows how to read.\n\nSecond: You've made me religious, but not about God. About small mercies. The miracle of your hair in my bathroom drain. The sacred ritual of you stealing my socks and returning them inside-out. The holy mystery of how you can sleep through sirens but wake up if I stop breathing for two seconds. I believe in these things the way some people believe in saints.\n\nThird: I'm terrified. Not of losing you\u2014that's too simple. I'm terrified that I'm not brave enough to be loved by you. That I'll always be catching up to the person you see when you look at me. You love me like I'm already forgiven for sins I haven't confessed yet. How do I live up to that kind of grace?\n\nBut here's what changes everything\u2014the beginning I saved for last: Two weeks ago, you talked in your sleep. Complete sentences. You said: \"The plants need water but wait until Tuesday.\" Then: \"Tell him about the green door.\" Finally: \"Warren makes my bones happy.\"\n\nWarren makes my bones happy.\n\nI've been trying to write you the truth ever since, but that's it, isn't it? The mundane, unconscious, absolute fact of it. Not my heart, not my soul\u2014my bones. The architecture of me is happy because of you. The framework. The part that holds everything else up.\n\nSo here's my proposal, delivered backwards like everything important: I've already chosen you in every future. Now I'm asking you to make it official in this one. Marry me because your unconscious mind trusts me with mysterious messages about plants and doors. Because my bones are happy too. Because love isn't actually addition or division\u2014it's multiplication. Every moment with you creates ten more I want to have.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm promising you the produce section and the broken peaches and the way I'll always cry at the wrong things but for the right reasons. I'm promising you that fifty years from now, I'll still be documenting the new ways you mispronounce things, still stealing the blankets back, still waking up at 6:17 to marry you again in the church of our bedroom while you decide whether consciousness is worth it.\n\nIt is.

You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost\u2014the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7035)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:52 AM on the bathroom floor because it's the only place cold enough to shock me into honesty. You wanted truth? Here's the receipt: I've been lying to you since we met. Every \"I'm fine\" was code for \"I'm reorganizing my entire molecular structure around the fact of you.\" Every casual goodbye was a small death I pretended not to notice.\n\nThe truth is I've been conducting experiments on myself. Subject: one former human. Hypothesis: exposure to Leyi will result in complete cellular revolution. Results: confirmed. I've documented everything\u2014how my hands shake for exactly seventeen minutes after you leave a room, how food tastes like cardboard when you're angry with me, how I've developed the ability to sense your mood changes from three rooms away like some kind of emotional seismograph. This isn't love. It's evolution. I'm becoming a new species designed specifically for loving you.\n\nHere's what I need to confess: I rehearse our future fights in the shower. I've already forgiven you for things you haven't done yet. I've written eulogies for both of us, just to practice surviving the unthinkable. Last Tuesday, I found myself in the grocery store defending your hatred of cilantro to a stranger. I wasn't even buying cilantro. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who evangelizes your preferences to produce sections.\n\nYou think you know how I love you? You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I keep your used tea bags in my pocket sometimes, like relics from a saint I'm not supposed to believe in. You don't know that when you sleep, I practice being dead\u2014lying completely still, holding my breath\u2014just to prepare for a world where I might have to exist without you. It doesn't work. My body refuses to accept the simulation.\n\nThe ugliest truth: I love you like a diagnosis I've been misreading my whole life. All those years thinking I was broken\u2014irregular heartbeat, chronic insomnia, that persistent sense of homesickness even when I was home\u2014turns out I was just symptomatic of your absence. A pre-existing condition waiting for its cause.\n\nBut here's what changed everything: Last Thursday at 11:47 PM, you were reading the ingredients on a box of crackers out loud, and I understood infinity. Not as a concept, but as a specific texture\u2014the sound of you saying \"modified corn starch\" while wearing my socks. That's when I knew: I don't want to marry you. Marriage is too small a word for what I want. I want to merge with you at the quantum level. I want our atoms to get confused about whose electrons belong to whom. I want scientists to discover a new kind of particle that only exists when we're in the same room.\n\nSo here's my proposal, though \"proposal\" implies I'm giving you a choice and we both know that's a lie: Let's fail towards each other for the rest of our lives. Let's be the couple that makes other people uncomfortable with our specific brand of codependence. Let's have the same fight about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one has to finish both sides out of muscle memory.\n\nI'm not offering you happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't felt what I feel when you correct my pronunciation of \"bagel\" with such gentle condescension that I want to be wrong about everything forever. I'm offering you something more honest: a witness. Someone who will memorize every version of you\u2014Tuesday-morning you who forgets where you put your glasses (they're on your head), Friday-night you who gets competitive about Scrabble, Sunday-afternoon you who cries at commercials but pretends it's allergies. I will catalog every iteration like a scientist studying the only thing that matters in the universe.\n\nThe final truth, the one that terrifies me most: I would rather argue with you about the proper way to fold fitted sheets than experience perfect harmony with anyone else. I would rather have you roll your eyes at me for the ten-thousandth time than have someone else look at me with worship. I want your specific brand of difficult. I want your exact frequency of complicated.\n\nYou wanted something that would move you? You've already moved me. Tectonically. I'm a different geography now. There are new countries inside me named after the way you laugh when you're trying not to. There are oceans that didn't exist before you mispronounced \"archipelago\" with such confidence I wanted to rewrite the dictionary.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. It's a medical chart. It's evidence. It's what I'll show God when they ask me what I did with my life: I loved Leyi so specifically that it changed my DNA.\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is too general. Say yes because you recognize me, the way animals recognize their homes by scent, the way birds know which way is north without understanding magnetism. Say yes because we're already married in every universe where choice is an illusion and this is just paperwork.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Steam keeps erasing the words. Good. They were lies anyway.\n\nHere's what I can't say: I've been documenting you. Not romantically\u2014clinically. Like evidence. Your coffee leaves rings in perfect concentric circles. You hold pencils wrong, between your middle and ring finger. When you sleep, you curl into exactly 3/4 of a question mark. I know because I measured. This is the shape of my obsession: precise, embarrassing, total.\n\nTruth? I was alive before you. Fully operative. I had a credit score and opinions about mattress firmness. But that person feels like someone I read about once\u2014plausible but theoretical. You didn't save me. You revealed that I needed saving, which is crueler and more necessary.\n\n4:17 AM: You talk in your sleep. Not words\u2014pre-words, like language before it hardens into meaning. I've been translating. So far I have: \"The door isn't real\" and \"Tuesdays are heavier than Wednesdays\" and my name, said like an accusation. This is the only doctorate I want\u2014a degree in your subconscious, a thesis on the specific gravity of your dreams.\n\nI lied about the hotel soap. I'm writing this in permanent marker on my arm because I want the words to hurt a little, to leave evidence. You asked for truth that would move you? The truth doesn't move. It sits. Heavy. Like the fact that your father's watch stops at 11:47 and you wind it every morning anyway. Like how you practice arguments in the shower for confrontations you'll never have. Like the way I've started seeing my future as a series of opportunities to disappoint you and deciding that's still better than any alternative that doesn't include you.\n\nYou're not my first love. You're my last attempt at being a person. Before you, I was method acting at existence\u2014hitting my marks, remembering my lines. Now I forget what I'm supposed to be performing. You've made me unprofessional at my own life.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a diagnosis I'm afraid to confirm. Like those three seconds between dropping something fragile and finding out if it broke. You've become the margin of error in every calculation, the variable that makes all my proofs unsolvable. I used to be good at math.\n\nTuesday: Watched you eat an apple while reading. You bit in rhythm with the sentences. Short sentence, small bite. Long sentence, bigger bite. You were unconsciously synchronized with Virginia Woolf. This is the exact moment I understood religion\u2014not the comfort kind, the terror kind. The kind that makes you want to build cathedrals or burn them down.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in seventeen different ways. Legally? No. But molecularly, cellularly, in whatever dimension decisions get made before we make them. When you leave a room, I study the depression in the cushion where you sat. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive losing.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? Here: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I felt it in my identical finger. Not metaphorically. I bled. Same finger, same joint. The doctor said \"psychosomatic stigmata.\" I said \"love.\" We were both right.\n\nSo here's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but specifically. Like a fever that becomes your new normal temperature. Like a chronic condition that makes all previous health feel like sickness. Let me love you with the kind of precision that ruins you for approximate affection.\n\nI'm not promising you forever. Forever is a word for people who've never watched their mothers forget their fathers' names. I'm promising you now, with such intensity that it bends time around it, makes before and after irrelevant. I'm promising you the kind of present tense that makes grammar give up.\n\nThis is my proposition: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I become when you read it. The one who exists only in the space between my confession and your response. The one who finally understands that love isn't about being understood\u2014it's about being willing to remain mysterious together.\n\nI love you like an error in the code that makes the whole program run better. Like a typo that accidentally spells God.\n\nYours (in the most medically concerning way),\nWarren\n\nP.S. The hotel soap was real. I wrote your name first. The mirror is still foggy.

Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me. You asked for truth. Here's mine: I never believed in soulmates until I met someone whose silences felt like home.\n\nYou know that scar on my left palm? I've told everyone it's from cooking. But it's from the day before I met you\u2014I punched a wall because I was so tired of being alone I couldn't breathe. Then you walked into that bookstore, mispronounced \"Murakami,\" and suddenly oxygen existed again. I still have the receipt from the coffee we didn't finish. $7.43. The exact price of learning that my life had been lived in lowercase until you.\n\nHere's what I never told you: I Google \"how to be a better partner\" at least twice a week. I keep a note in my phone of every time you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one you do for strangers. (Current count: 1,847.) When you had the flu last March and apologized for being gross, I thought: this is it. This is what they mean by \"in sickness.\" You, fevered and furious at your own body, were more beautiful than any symphony.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. But ordinary people don't name their plants after dead philosophers. Ordinary people don't cry during commercials about reunited dogs. Ordinary people don't make me want to call my mother and tell her I finally understand why she still watches my father sleep after thirty-seven years.\n\nThe truth? I'm not good at love. I'm selfish and scared and sometimes I test your patience just to make sure you'll stay. When you leave for work, I smell your pillow like some ridiculous movie character. I've practiced proposing to your photograph. I write your name in the margins of books I'll never lend anyone.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me most: you make me want to be worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching. That soft, unguarded moment where your face does something I don't have words for\u2014something between recognition and wonder, like you're seeing not who I am but who I could become if I'm brave enough.\n\nI used to think love was about finding someone who could tolerate my damage. You taught me it's about finding someone who makes that damage feel like stained glass\u2014broken pieces that become beautiful when light passes through.\n\nSo marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014that's a lie we tell ourselves. Marry me because you make me want to complete myself. Because every day you choose me is a day I learn to choose myself. Because \"I love you\" in your mouth sounds like a promise that tomorrow will exist.\n\nI'm done being clever. Done trying to sound like someone who deserves you.

Undergoing a kind of cellular revolution where everything I was gets voted out, replaced by something that recognizes you in the dark by the weight of your silence. Before you, I had opinions. Now I have this spreading quiet where certainty used to live, and the quiet sounds exactly like your breathing at 5:15 AM when the world hasn't touched you yet.\n\nI lied. I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

Starting with the end: I've already married you seventeen times in the gap between heartbeats. The ceremony happens every morning at 6:17 when you make that small sound\u2014not quite a sigh, not quite a hum\u2014that means you're deciding whether to wake up or wage war against consciousness for five more minutes. I pronounce us married then. The universe officates. Your breathing is the only witness we need.\n\nNow the middle: I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But I was wrong about the math. Love is division\u2014I've been split open, and everything I was certain about has fallen out. Yesterday I found myself crying in the produce section because the bruised peaches reminded me of your knee that time you fell off your bike trying to prove you could ride with no hands. This is what you've done: made me unable to look at damaged fruit without thinking about mortality and mercy and the specific weight of your body against mine when you're too tired to pretend you're not tired.\n\nHere's what I need to tell you before the beginning: I love you like a medical emergency. Not romantic\u2014literal. My body has reorganized itself around the fact of you. My circadian rhythm now matches yours. My left hand has developed muscle memory for the curve of your hip. When you're gone, my skeleton doesn't know how to arrange itself. I become architecturally unsound.\n\nThe truth has three parts:\n\nFirst: I document you compulsively. Not in photos\u2014in cellular memory. The way you murder pronunciation of \"worcestershire.\" How you arrange pills by size, not schedule. Your vendetta against fitted sheets. The surgical precision with which you remove tomatoes from sandwiches. I'm building an encyclopedia of you, but it's written in a language only my body knows how to read.\n\nSecond: You've made me religious, but not about God. About small mercies. The miracle of your hair in my bathroom drain. The sacred ritual of you stealing my socks and returning them inside-out. The holy mystery of how you can sleep through sirens but wake up if I stop breathing for two seconds. I believe in these things the way some people believe in saints.\n\nThird: I'm terrified. Not of losing you\u2014that's too simple. I'm terrified that I'm not brave enough to be loved by you. That I'll always be catching up to the person you see when you look at me. You love me like I'm already forgiven for sins I haven't confessed yet. How do I live up to that kind of grace?\n\nBut here's what changes everything\u2014the beginning I saved for last: Two weeks ago, you talked in your sleep. Complete sentences. You said: \"The plants need water but wait until Tuesday.\" Then: \"Tell him about the green door.\" Finally: \"Warren makes my bones happy.\"\n\nWarren makes my bones happy.\n\nI've been trying to write you the truth ever since, but that's it, isn't it? The mundane, unconscious, absolute fact of it. Not my heart, not my soul\u2014my bones. The architecture of me is happy because of you. The framework. The part that holds everything else up.\n\nSo here's my proposal, delivered backwards like everything important: I've already chosen you in every future. Now I'm asking you to make it official in this one. Marry me because your unconscious mind trusts me with mysterious messages about plants and doors. Because my bones are happy too. Because love isn't actually addition or division\u2014it's multiplication. Every moment with you creates ten more I want to have.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm promising you the produce section and the broken peaches and the way I'll always cry at the wrong things but for the right reasons. I'm promising you that fifty years from now, I'll still be documenting the new ways you mispronounce things, still stealing the blankets back, still waking up at 6:17 to marry you again in the church of our bedroom while you decide whether consciousness is worth it.\n\nIt is. With you, it always is.\n\nYours from the end to the beginning and back again,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The green door\u2014I looked it up. In dream symbolism, it means new opportunities.

Not romantic\u2014scientific. You have seven different laughs. The third one (duration: 2.3 seconds, involves your left shoulder) means you're actually surprised by joy. You own fourteen spoons but only use three. When you're anxious, you alphabetize things that don't need alphabetizing. Last Tuesday you arranged my books by color while I was at work. I haven't fixed it. It's the most beautiful thing I own now\u2014this rainbow of literature you made because your hands needed something to forgive.\n\nBLOOD: Here's what I can't say out loud: I practice losing you. Daily drills. I imagine the call, the crisis, the cosmic joke of finally finding you just to lose you to something stupid like time or physics or your human need to be more than just mine. But here's the thing\u2014even in the rehearsals, even in my catastrophic imagination, you're worth the ending. That's how I know this is real. I'm pre-grieving you and still choosing this.\n\nBREATH: You asked for truth? I've been breathing wrong my whole life. Inhale, exhale, automatic. Then you fell asleep on my chest last September and your breathing reprogrammed mine. Now we breathe in tandem even when you're in another city. My lungs have forgotten how to work independently. This isn't poetry. I've measured it. Six breaths per minute when you're calm. Eight when you're dreaming. Twelve when you're about to cry but haven't decided yet.\n\nWhat you don't know: I've been writing you letters since before we met. Not to you\u2014toward you. Like prayers to a god I hadn't invented yet. They all said the same thing: \"I'm practicing being someone worth finding.\" Then you found me first, which was the miracle I hadn't thought to ask for.\n\nThree weeks ago you said my name in your sleep. Not called it\u2014just said it, like you were reading it off something important. Like you were checking to make sure it was still there. This is the sound I want to die hearing. Not romantic\u2014literal. Let that be the last data my brain processes. \"Warren,\" in your sleeping voice, checking I still exist.\n\nThe terror: You love me like I'm already healed from things that haven't stopped bleeding. You look at me like I'm arriving instead of leaving. How do I explain that before you, I was just a collection of symptoms? Chronic insomnia. Selective memory. A persistent cough that turned out to be unsaid words. You're not my cure\u2014that's too simple. You're the diagnosis that explains why nothing else ever worked.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I'll be in five minutes when the ink dries. The person I'll be tomorrow when I remember how you hold forks like weapons and newspapers like shields. The person I'll be in fifty years when I still flinch every time you leave a room because some part of me is convinced you're too good to be real.\n\nI'm not offering you forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't watched their mothers forget their names. I'm offering you right now, with such violence and precision that it makes the future irrelevant. I'm offering you this specific Tuesday where you're reading this and I'm listening to your breathing change, calculating whether it means yes or no or \"ask me again when I stop crying.\"\n\nYou wanted something true enough to move you? Here: I don't love you. Love is too small a word for this. I've been colonized by you. You've rewritten my source code. When archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the moment you first said my name correctly. Everything before that was just waiting to begin.\n\nThis is my confession: I would rather watch you leave than never see you arrive. I would rather be destroyed by you than preserved by anyone else. I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything that matters less, which is everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Or say nothing and let me translate your silence into seventeen different kinds of maybe. But know this: I've already married you in the only church that matters\u2014the one made of Tuesday mornings and burnt coffee and the way you murder every plant you've ever loved but keep trying anyway.\n\nI love you like evidence of God. Like proof that random atoms can accidentally write Shakespeare. Like the opposite of entropy. Like the universe admitting it made everything else as practice for making you.\n\nYours in whatever dimension this is real in,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the dying pen. I bought seventeen new ones. I wanted to make sure I could finish this. That's the kind of person you've made me\u2014someone who plans ahead for the possibility of truth.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
