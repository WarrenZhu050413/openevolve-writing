I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "b736418a-fbd1-4ae2-beed-e7b527445379", "generation": 4, "timestamp": 1756701981.35081, "iteration_found": 0, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.7439999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.78, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.76, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:52 AM.
