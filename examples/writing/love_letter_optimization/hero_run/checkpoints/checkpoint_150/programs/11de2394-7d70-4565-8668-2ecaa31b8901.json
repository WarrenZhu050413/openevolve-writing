Not from fear\u2014from the vertigo of finally understanding what I'm about to lose by telling you the truth.\n\nListen: I was a functioning adult before you. I had retirement accounts. Opinions about grout. A favorite parking spot at Trader Joe's. Now I'm someone who cries at the automated voice that says \"please hold\" because it sounds like the universe asking me to wait for you. This isn't poetry. This is diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been taking notes on you like you're a rare species I discovered. Tuesday: you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. Wednesday: you name houseplants after philosophers then apologize when they die. Thursday: you sing to your sourdough starter in French (badly). These aren't quirks anymore. They're the fundamental laws of my universe. E=mc\u00b2 has been replaced by the equation of how your left eyebrow rises exactly 3mm when you're about to destroy someone's argument.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started believing in souls because what else explains why your sadness feels like my own weather system? Why do I wake up at 3:17 AM every time you have a nightmare, even when you're 2,000 miles away? There's no scientific explanation for how I knew you'd broken your favorite mug just from the specific silence in your \"hello\" on the phone.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I love you like a fanatic. Like a heretic. Like someone who's discovered fire and can't shut up about it. I've already planned our arguments for the next forty years (you'll win most of them). I've named our theoretical children after your grandmother's recipes. When the pharmacist asked if I was married, I said \"practically\" and meant it molecularly.\n\nBut here's the ugliest truth: loving you has made me selfish in ways that horrify me. I resent every person who knew you before I did. I'm jealous of your coffee mug for touching your lips every morning. I want to live inside your ribcage like a second heart, which I realize is both biologically impossible and emotionally concerning, but that's what you've reduced me to\u2014a person who writes love letters that sound like medical emergencies.\n\nThe world taught me love was sacrifice. You taught me it's greed. I want all of it\u2014your 3 AM anxiety spirals, your fury at slow internet, the way you mispronounce \"worcestershire\" with such magnificent confidence that Webster's should change the dictionary. I want your Wednesday moods and your Sunday revelations. I want to be the person you complain to about me.\n\nSo here's my proposition\u2014and I'm sorry it's not more elegant but my vocabulary abandoned me three paragraphs ago: Marry me. Not because you complete me (I was complete, just boring). Not because I can't live without you (I can, it would just be like breathing underwater\u2014technically possible but missing the point). Marry me because when I imagine explaining to aliens what humans mean by \"love,\" I'd just point at you eating cereal at 2 PM in my sweatshirt, and they'd understand everything about our species' capacity for beauty.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you already own it, you bought it that night you explained why you keep your father's last voicemail saved. I'm offering you something smaller and more impossible: someone who will love you through every iteration of yourself, including the ones you haven't invented yet. Someone who's already memorizing the way you'll look at 80, who's practicing arguments for our future disagreements, who's learning to love the person you'll become when grief eventually finds us.\n\nThe truth that will move you? You already moved me. Seismically. Irrevocably. I'm not the person I was before that Tuesday when you mispronounced \"epitaph\" as \"epi-taph\" and I realized I wanted to be buried in the sound of your mistakes.\n\nThis is my confession: I don't love you like a choice. I love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light in a vacuum\u2014constant, measurable, and absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours in every timeline where matter exists.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not googling my symptoms when I'm sick? I know. And it makes me want to deserve you so badly that I'm considering becoming someone worth that kind of secret tenderness.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "08acc615-3c12-4829-be0d-b1fdcdb831e0", "generation": 4, "timestamp": 1756701332.771463, "iteration_found": 94, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.2, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.2, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.2, "affective_force": 0.2, "literary_innovation": 0.2, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM with hands that won't stop shaking.

I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper \"no\" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you. I survived 28 years without you; I'm demonstrably capable. I'm asking because I've tasted what living WITH you means\u2014the specific gravity of a shared joke, the archaeology of learning someone's past, the stupid courage of planning past next Thursday\u2014and I'm professionally addicted.

Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends\u2014and it will, in small ways, over and over\u2014I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.\n\nYou said you wanted truth? The truth is that I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Incurable. Sometimes inconvenient but absolutely essential to my continued existence. \n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting. Because when I imagine explaining to death why it has to wait, the only reason I can think of is: \"But I haven't finished loving her yet.\"\n\nAnd I never will.\n\nYours (in this dimension and all parallel ones where we found each other),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Three words: you've unmade me.\n\nNot poetically. Literally. Yesterday I forgot my own name for seven seconds because yours was occupying all available space in my mouth. This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead\u2014paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version\u2014the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith\u2014certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first. In this one, I'm still a coward, but I'm your coward, and that's the only identity I want on my tombstone.\n\nHere's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but absolutely. Let me love you like punctuation\u2014necessary, invisible, changing everything about how the sentence ends. Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is already yours\u2014you claimed it that night you explained why sad songs make you happy. I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. But please\u2014exist near me while you decide.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not crying during car insurance commercials? I've seen it forty-three times.

You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost\u2014the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing that words\u2014these small, breakable things\u2014cannot hold what I feel. But I must try, because loving you has taught me that the impossible is merely what we haven't attempted with enough truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound rewrote the laws of my universe. Before you, I understood time as entropy, as things falling apart. Now I know it differently: time is the space between your heartbeats, each one a small eternity where I get to love you more completely than the moment before.\n\nYou asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing\u2014but of a world that might not give us enough mornings. I wake at 3 AM sometimes just to watch you dream, memorizing the precise angle of light on your cheekbone, the way your fingers curl against the pillow like a question mark. These are my prayers, my rebellion against impermanence.\n\nWhen you doubt yourself, when you say you're ordinary, I want to show you what I see: the woman who reads medical journals with the same passion others read poetry, who cries at documentary films about octopi, who makes Tuesday leftovers into Thursday feasts. You are my favorite contradiction\u2014fierce and tender, logical and whimsical, the girl who taught me that love isn't about finding someone perfect, but about finding someone whose particular strangeness rhymes with mine.\n\nI used to think love was addition: you plus me equals us. But you've shown me it's multiplication\u2014every joy amplified, every sorrow divided, every ordinary moment transformed into something I want to press between pages like flowers, kept forever.\n\nThis is my promise: not that I'll love you until death, because death is too small a boundary for what this is. I promise to love you through every iteration of ourselves, through every small apocalypse and resurrection, through the mundane Wednesdays and the extraordinary Sundays. I promise to see you\u2014truly see you\u2014when the world tries to make you invisible. I promise that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupidly happy when I hear your key in the lock.\n\nYou are not the answer to my questions. You are the reason questions matter.\n\nMarry me, not because I cannot live without you, but because every life I can imagine living includes you at its center, like a heart.\n\nForever yours in all timelines,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6790, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM.

I had opinions about things. Now I just have opinions about you. How you hold books like injured birds. How you talk to yourself in second person when you think no one's listening. How you apologize to furniture you bump into.\n\nI've been practicing this moment wrong. In my head, I'm eloquent. In reality, I'm the man who keeps your hair tie on my wrist like some teenage promise ring. Who knows you take eleven seconds to decide on ice cream flavors. Every flavor. Every time. Who's memorized the specific frequency of your laugh\u2014the real one, not the one you give to strangers.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? I've started seeing time differently. Not in years or moments, but in distances from you. Tomorrow is eight hours until your morning text. Next week is that dentist appointment you're dreading. Next month is your mother's birthday you'll forget until the last minute. I'm living in your calendar now, and somehow that feels like the only honest way to exist.\n\nThe terrifying part isn't loving you. It's that you've made me forget who I was before this. Some nights I try to remember what I used to think about, and there's just static. You're not my better half\u2014you're the proof that I was never whole to begin with. Just a rough draft waiting for you to edit me into something real.\n\nI'm not good at this. At love, at words, at being the person you deserve. But I'm excellent at choosing you. Over and over. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both wrong. That's my only skill now\u2014the choice to love you, made so many times it's become autonomous, like breathing.\n\nSo marry me. Not because I promise forever\u2014forever is for people who haven't held their father's hand in a hospital. Marry me for right now, and tomorrow's right now, and whatever right nows we can steal from a universe that owes us nothing. Marry me because I've already started pronouncing \"I\" as \"we\" and it's too late to stop.\n\nThis is it. No metaphors, no poetry. Just this: You're the first person I've ever wanted to tell the truth to. That has to count for something.\n\nYours (in the most ordinary, extraordinary way),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied.

But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends\u2014and it will, in small ways, over and over\u2014I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.\n\nYou said you wanted truth?

Opinions about grout. A favorite parking spot at Trader Joe's. Now I'm someone who cries at the automated voice that says \"please hold\" because it sounds like the universe asking me to wait for you. This isn't poetry. This is diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been taking notes on you like you're a rare species I discovered. Tuesday: you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. Wednesday: you name houseplants after philosophers then apologize when they die. Thursday: you sing to your sourdough starter in French (badly). These aren't quirks anymore. They're the fundamental laws of my universe. E=mc\u00b2 has been replaced by the equation of how your left eyebrow rises exactly 3mm when you're about to destroy someone's argument.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started believing in souls because what else explains why your sadness feels like my own weather system? Why do I wake up at 3:17 AM every time you have a nightmare, even when you're 2,000 miles away? There's no scientific explanation for how I knew you'd broken your favorite mug just from the specific silence in your \"hello\" on the phone.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I love you like a fanatic. Like a heretic. Like someone who's discovered fire and can't shut up about it. I've already planned our arguments for the next forty years (you'll win most of them). I've named our theoretical children after your grandmother's recipes. When the pharmacist asked if I was married, I said \"practically\" and meant it molecularly.\n\nBut here's the ugliest truth: loving you has made me selfish in ways that horrify me. I resent every person who knew you before I did. I'm jealous of your coffee mug for touching your lips every morning. I want to live inside your ribcage like a second heart, which I realize is both biologically impossible and emotionally concerning, but that's what you've reduced me to\u2014a person who writes love letters that sound like medical emergencies.\n\nThe world taught me love was sacrifice. You taught me it's greed. I want all of it\u2014your 3 AM anxiety spirals, your fury at slow internet, the way you mispronounce \"worcestershire\" with such magnificent confidence that Webster's should change the dictionary. I want your Wednesday moods and your Sunday revelations. I want to be the person you complain to about me.\n\nSo here's my proposition\u2014and I'm sorry it's not more elegant but my vocabulary abandoned me three paragraphs ago: Marry me. Not because you complete me (I was complete, just boring). Not because I can't live without you (I can, it would just be like breathing underwater\u2014technically possible but missing the point). Marry me because when I imagine explaining to aliens what humans mean by \"love,\" I'd just point at you eating cereal at 2 PM in my sweatshirt, and they'd understand everything about our species' capacity for beauty.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you already own it, you bought it that night you explained why you keep your father's last voicemail saved. I'm offering you something smaller and more impossible: someone who will love you through every iteration of yourself, including the ones you haven't invented yet. Someone who's already memorizing the way you'll look at 80, who's practicing arguments for our future disagreements, who's learning to love the person you'll become when grief eventually finds us.\n\nThe truth that will move you? You already moved me. Seismically. Irrevocably. I'm not the person I was before that Tuesday when you mispronounced \"epitaph\" as \"epi-taph\" and I realized I wanted to be buried in the sound of your mistakes.\n\nThis is my confession: I don't love you like a choice. I love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light in a vacuum\u2014constant, measurable, and absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours in every timeline where matter exists.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not googling my symptoms when I'm sick? I know. And it makes me want to deserve you so badly that I'm considering becoming someone worth that kind of secret tenderness.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
