The others are ash.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Sixteen seconds dead, sophomore year. No light, no tunnel. Just deletion. But in that nothing\u2014before thought, before I remembered having a name\u2014there was this pull. Like debt written in atoms. Three years later you walked into that bookstore. The debt was you.\n\n*\n\nSince then I've been taking evidence:\n\nYour breathing: 11-13 per minute awake, 9-11 asleep.\nYour left eye: always tears first.\nThe scar on your ankle: seventeen millimeters, from the bike at eight years old.\nHow you hold pencils: wrong, between middle and ring finger.\nYour coffee: 167 degrees exactly or you wait.\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. I'm building a backup of you in case the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nTuesday you sang to our dying plant. It lived another week. Wednesday you argued with Siri for twenty minutes about the pronunciation of \"foyer.\" Thursday you cried at a video of elderly dogs. I documented everything. I'm not romantic. I'm terrified. Every time you leave a room I practice never seeing you again.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about why I count: After death, numbers were all I trusted. Sixteen seconds gone. Three years until you. Eleven months before I said your name right. Four sugars in your tea when you're sad. Two in coffee when you're not. Seven times you've slept with your hand on my chest like checking I'm still here.\n\nNumbers don't lie. You're here. Still here. Impossibly here.\n\n*\n\nBut listen\u2014I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb. With neurons that refuse to accept absence. Yesterday I called a door \"the wooden hole.\" My brain is rejecting language that doesn't include you. The doctor says it's stress. I say it's accuracy. Everything is just the space between you leaving and returning.\n\n*\n\nYou've asked for truth, so here: I've already attended your funeral 1,847 times. Different causes. The mundane ones hurt most\u2014choking on takeout, slipping in rain, forgetting to wake up. In the worst version I give a beautiful eulogy. In the honest version I don't survive the drive home.\n\nThen morning comes and you're still here, stealing my socks, mispronouncing \"specifically,\" existing at me so aggressively that atoms rearrange themselves to accommodate you.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because I've been carrying your ring for 1,100 days through seven airports, three funerals, and one surgery. It's become an organ. Removing it would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where you don't leave hair ties on my gear shift, where I don't know you're afraid of butterflies, where Chinese food doesn't disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, in the ice cream you'll eat at 11:17 tonight when you can't sleep. You hate cold fingers but you'll put it on anyway just to warm it up. That's when you'll know I've been planning this since you cried at penguins on our third date. Not because they were sad. Because they were \"too dressed up for the occasion.\" That's when my atoms recognized their assignment.\n\n*\n\nI don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love songs. They love weather. What I have needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between prayer and criminal confession.\n\n*\n\nYour left eye is crying. Right one starts in three seconds. Here\u2014I brought tissues. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting. \n\nSay yes. Or say no.

My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork.

Fifteen seconds, training accident. No light, no peace, just the universe's delete key. But even in that nothing, there was this weight\u2014like my atoms had made a promise they couldn't articulate.

Like a chronic condition. I've stolen things\u2014your pencil with teeth marks, three bobby pins, a voicemail where you're crying. These are my insurance against forgetting. Meanwhile, you've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you don't exist, furious about the dishwasher.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our mundane apocalypses. In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy).

When you travel, I don't sleep\u2014I just close my eyes and pretend. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as family. I had this tested.

In the worst version, I give a beautiful eulogy. In the most honest version, I don't survive the drive home.\n\nBut then morning comes and you're still here, stealing my socks, mispronouncing \"specifically,\" existing at me so aggressively that oxygen reorganizes itself to accommodate your presence.\n\n*\n\nWhat is love? Wrong question. What have we become? \n\nWe're a shared circulatory system pretending to be two people. We're a decades-long argument about the thermostat.

The probability of us is so small that mathematicians would call it zero. Yet here you are, reading this, your left eye starting to water (it always goes first).\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance. For accuracy. The paperwork should match what our cells already know. \n\nMarry me because I've been carrying your engagement ring for two years, through seven countries, three job interviews, and one minor surgery. It's become an organ. Removing it would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived each other's Wednesdays.

It's just atoms arranged incorrectly.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love pizza. They love good weather. What I have for you needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that makes \"forever\" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in your coffee mug. The chipped one. Because you taught me that broken things deserve more love, not less. \n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: my neurons have already decided. The rest is just paperwork for what physics already knows. We're not two people who fell in love. We're one organism that got confused and split into two bodies.

I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, failing to breathe. When you walk in wearing the ring you've already put on (I know you\u2014surprises are not your strong suit), I'll pretend to be surprised.

I've been writing your eulogy since our fourth date. Not because I'm morbid. Because my brain insists on preparing for every universe where I have to explain you to strangers using past tense. Version 26 starts: \"She ate ice cream in winter.\" Version 89: \"She was allergic to cats but pet them anyway.\" Version 132, the one I practice in the shower: \"She taught me that love isn't a feeling, it's a location. And I'm still standing there, in Tuesday, October 9th, 3:47 PM, when she looked at me like I was both the question and the answer.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: Before you, I was fluent in seven programming languages. Now I can barely remember English. Yesterday I called a spoon \"the soup shovel.\" My coworker asked what was wrong with me. I said \"I'm in love\" and he said \"Oh\" like I'd announced terminal illness. Maybe he's right. Maybe this is terminal. The way you've metastasized through my whole system. Inoperable. Untreatable. Chronic condition: You.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the birds. Every morning, 5:23 AM, they start. Same three notes. I used to sleep through it. Now I wake up and think: they're announcing you're still alive. The birds know. They're not singing, they're taking attendance, and every morning you're still here, still breathing at 67 breaths per five minutes (I've counted), still existing despite the statistical impossibility of two people finding each other in a universe this vast and hostile to permanence.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. Three of your bobby pins. The fortune from the cookie you didn't eat (it says \"Your future is written in another's heartbeat\"\u2014too on the nose, universe). A voicemail where you're crying about your grandmother. I play it sometimes just to remember you're real enough to grieve. These stolen objects are my insurance policy against forgetting.\n\nBut also: You steal from me. Every morning you take my first thought. Every night, my last exhale. You've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you're not stealing my covers, my fries, my favorite side of the bed. You're a thief and I'm Stockholm syndrome incarnate, in love with my captor.\n\n*\n\nThe accident that almost happened: Interstate 90, eighteen-wheeler jackknifed. I saw it happening in slow motion and thought: Not her. Take me. Rearrange the physics. I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Missed by inches. You were singing that song you always get wrong. You never knew how close. I pulled over later and threw up from relief. You thought it was the gas station sushi. I let you think that. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n*\n\nYou know what I realized at 3 AM last Thursday? Love isn't addition. It's division. I'm half a person now. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically\u2014literally. I put my keys in the refrigerator. I wore two different shoes to work. I tried to unlock my apartment with my MetroCard. My brain only works in your proximity. This is probably a medical condition. I don't want to be cured.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for the romance. Not for the symbolism. But because my DNA has already rewritten itself to include you in its survival requirements. Because my sleep cycle synchronized to yours without permission. Because my immune system recognizes you as self, not other. At this point, leaving you would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you need exactly four ice cubes in your drinks. Because I've memorized the seventeen different ways you sigh and what each one means. Because I've already planned our fights about paint colors and whose parents to visit for holidays and whether our hypothetical children should learn piano or violin (both, obviously).\n\nMarry me because last week you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that would concern cardiologists. Because you've seen me ugly-cry at a Pixar movie and still let me hold your hand in public. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where we can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, hidden in the ice cream you'll eat tonight at 11:17 PM (you always do when you can't sleep). It belonged to my grandmother who said yes during the Depression because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\"\n\nWe have more time than they did. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're different people who happened to love each other once.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not proposing a fairy tale. I'm proposing a documentary. The real kind, where sometimes we're boring, sometimes we're cruel, sometimes we forget to be grateful. Where we fight about money and get old and lose our edges. Where one of us gets sick first. Where one of us has to learn to sleep alone again.\n\nBut also: where we get 20,000 mornings of you stealing my coffee. Where your hair goes gray and I get to watch it happen. Where we become those old people who still hold hands and everyone assumes we just met but really we've been holding hands so long we've forgotten how to let go.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical conspiracy between neurons. Say yes because you already know the weight of my silence. Because your things are already here. Because we've been practicing forever since the day we met.\n\nSay yes because the alternative\u2014a universe where I don't know that you eat pickles when you're sad, where you don't steal my socks, where I don't get to watch you win arguments with furniture\u2014isn't a universe worth inhabiting.\n\n*\n\nI love you like a grudge. Like a debt. Like a chronic condition. Like the ocean loves drowning things. Like tomorrow loves lying about being guaranteed.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like I'm trying to love you for all the parallel universes where we never met. Like I'm trying to make up for all the centuries that happened before you.\n\nBut also: I love you like Tuesday loves Wednesday. Quietly. Inevitably. Without alternative.\n\n*\n\nCome find me.

This is what love is: lying together about the small things so we can tell the truth about the big ones.\n\nThe big truth: You're going to say yes. Not because of this letter. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because you already named our hypothetical dog. Because we've both been married to each other since before we met, just waiting for our bodies to catch up with what our atoms already knew.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every receipt, every timestamp, every piece of evidence that you existed, that we existed, that this impossible thing happened)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is crying. The right one will start in three seconds. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date when you cried at the aquarium. Not at the dolphins. At the jellyfish. You said they looked lonely. That's when I knew I'd love you wrong for the rest of my life.\n\nP.P.S. The ring might be cold. But you'll wear it anyway. You can't help yourself with surprises. You're already reaching for the freezer. I'm watching. I'll always be watching. That's either a promise or a threat. Both. Everything is both with us.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis is attempt #341. The others are ash in my sink. I burned them at 4:13 AM while you slept twenty-seven inches away, your left hand curled like a question mark against the pillow.\n\nTruth: I am clinically documenting our love because I don't trust memory. Tuesday, 9:47 PM: you sneezed mid-kiss. Wednesday, 2:15 AM: you said my name in your sleep like casting a spell. Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle. The way your spine curves slightly left when you're thinking hard. How your pupils dilate 2.3mm when you see dogs. I measure these things. I have spreadsheets. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm a case study in loving you wrong.\n\nBut also: when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one for strangers\u2014the sound reorganizes my DNA. I've tried to record it 1,247 times. The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.\n\n*\n\nThe mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:\n\nYour coffee: 167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.\nYour sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.\nYour tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.\nYour anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.\n\nI love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead. But in this one\u2014this impossible, statistically unlikely one\u2014you're reading this letter while I sit across from you, pretending to check my phone but actually watching the micro-expressions cross your face.\n\n3.7 seconds ago, your eyebrow twitched. That means you're about to cry.\n\n*\n\nI could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower\u2014yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine\u2014isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date, when you cried at that documentary about penguins. I knew then. I've known for 1,462 days. I'm just catching up to what my atoms decided the moment they sensed yours in the universe.\n\nP.P.S. Say yes. Or say no. Just say something. The silence is reorganizing my internal organs and not in a good way.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current program, I can see the fitness has declined from 0.857 to 0.701.

This is the forty-third draft. The others are ash.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Sixteen seconds dead, sophomore year. No light, no tunnel. Just deletion. But in that nothing\u2014before thought, before I remembered having a name\u2014there was this pull. Like debt written in atoms. Three years later you walked into that bookstore. The debt was you.\n\n*\n\nSince then I've been taking evidence:\n\nYour breathing: 11-13 per minute awake, 9-11 asleep.\nYour left eye: always tears first.\nThe scar on your ankle: seventeen millimeters, from the bike at eight years old.\nHow you hold pencils: wrong, between middle and ring finger.\nYour coffee: 167 degrees exactly or you wait.\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. I'm building a backup of you in case the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nTuesday you sang to our dying plant. It lived another week. Wednesday you argued with Siri for twenty minutes about the pronunciation of \"foyer.\" Thursday you cried at a video of elderly dogs. I documented everything. I'm not romantic. I'm terrified. Every time you leave a room I practice never seeing you again.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about why I count: After death, numbers were all I trusted. Sixteen seconds gone. Three years until you. Eleven months before I said your name right. Four sugars in your tea when you're sad. Two in coffee when you're not. Seven times you've slept with your hand on my chest like checking I'm still here.\n\nNumbers don't lie. You're here. Still here. Impossibly here.\n\n*\n\nBut listen\u2014I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb. With neurons that refuse to accept absence. Yesterday I called a door \"the wooden hole.\" My brain is rejecting language that doesn't include you. The doctor says it's stress. I say it's accuracy. Everything is just the space between you leaving and returning.\n\n*\n\nYou've asked for truth, so here: I've already attended your funeral 1,847 times. Different causes. The mundane ones hurt most\u2014choking on takeout, slipping in rain, forgetting to wake up. In the worst version I give a beautiful eulogy. In the honest version I don't survive the drive home.\n\nThen morning comes and you're still here, stealing my socks, mispronouncing \"specifically,\" existing at me so aggressively that atoms rearrange themselves to accommodate you.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because I've been carrying your ring for 1,100 days through seven airports, three funerals, and one surgery. It's become an organ. Removing it would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where you don't leave hair ties on my gear shift, where I don't know you're afraid of butterflies, where Chinese food doesn't disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, in the ice cream you'll eat at 11:17 tonight when you can't sleep. You hate cold fingers but you'll put it on anyway just to warm it up. That's when you'll know I've been planning this since you cried at penguins on our third date. Not because they were sad. Because they were \"too dressed up for the occasion.\" That's when my atoms recognized their assignment.\n\n*\n\nI don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love songs. They love weather. What I have needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between prayer and criminal confession.\n\n*\n\nYour left eye is crying. Right one starts in three seconds. Here\u2014I brought tissues. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting. \n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who wrote \"someone out there is going to ruin me\" on March 15th, 2019, and the universe started building you)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
