Street lamp flickering through the windshield. It's 4:47 AM and I've been sitting here for two hours because I couldn't write this in our apartment\u2014you'd hear me crying.\n\nYou want truth? I've been documenting everything. Not metaphorically. Literally. There's a spreadsheet. \"Leyi_Data_Complete.xlsx.\" 47 tabs. Times you've laughed (1,247). Words you mispronounce (six, consistently). The exact angle your mouth makes when you're about to cry (seventeen degrees downward). I've calculated the statistical probability of someone like you loving someone like me. It's 0.00002%. I check the math daily because I can't believe you're real.\n\nLast Tuesday you asked why I was recording you eating toast. How do I explain that the sound\u2014that specific crunch at 73 decibels\u2014has become the frequency at which my sanity operates? That I've been building a database of you because I'm terrified that one day you'll leave and I'll need evidence you existed? \n\nHere's what you've done to me: I now have favorite versions of you. Tuesday-you who argues with NPR. Thursday-you who dances with the mop. 3-AM-you who sleep-talks in languages that don't exist. Sunday-you who cries at commercials about dogs but pretends it's allergies. I love them all differently and desperately, like they're separate people I'm committing polygamy with, except they're all you.\n\nThe truth is uglier than you think: I've already planned our whole life. Not romantically\u2014mathematically. I've calculated our mortgage at different interest rates. I've researched schools for children we haven't had. I know which hospitals are closest to every apartment we might live in. I've written my vows seventeen times. I practice them in traffic. Other drivers think I'm on Bluetooth. I'm not. I'm just insane about you.\n\nRemember when you found me sobbing in the shower last month? I said it was work stress. It wasn't. I'd just realized that statistically, based on actuarial tables, I'll probably die first. And I spent forty minutes crying about leaving you alone, about you having to learn how the thermostat works, about someone else discovering that you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad.\n\nYou should know: I'm not a good person. I judge people who walk slowly. I pretend to recycle but sometimes don't. I hate your best friend's laugh. But you make me want to deserve you. Not be better\u2014that's abstract. But deserve you, specifically. Like there's a ledger somewhere and I need to balance it through accumulated acts of devotion.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for 127 days. I know because there's an app. It tracks how many times I've almost proposed (643) versus how many times I've chickened out (643). Today makes 644 or possibly 1, depending on if you say yes.\n\nThe inside of the ring\u2014you can't see this in photos\u2014is engraved with the coordinates of where we met. Not romantic coordinates like Paris or sunset beach. A Walgreens parking lot. 34.0522\u00b0N, 118.2437\u00b0W. Where you were buying toilet paper and I was buying shame-candy at 11 PM and you said \"nice selection\" and my brain just... stopped. Reformatted. Rebooted with you as the operating system.\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying: I don't love you like a poet or a philosopher. I love you like a scientist who's discovered something that breaks all known laws. Like an accountant who's found an error in reality's books that somehow makes everything balance better. Like a madman who's so specifically insane that it loops back around to sanity.\n\nI need you to know that if you say no, I've already planned for that too. There's a contingency file. I'll move to Portland. I'll get a cat. I'll learn pottery. I'll become someone who can live without you. But it'll be like living without my liver. Technically possible but really just slow-motion dying.\n\nBut if you say yes? If you say yes, I have seventeen years of Tuesday dinners planned. I have a list of 247 inside jokes we haven't made yet. I have your surprise 40th birthday party already sketched out (your sister's in on it, don't tell her I told you). I have so much stupid, obsessive, mathematically documented love that I could fill servers with it.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though I hope it does, I ran it through sentiment analysis and it scored high. Marry me because I've already integrated you into my source code. Because I love you with the kind of precision that's indistinguishable from madness. Because I've turned devotion into data science and somehow that makes it more true, not less.\n\nI just checked my heart rate monitor. 147 BPM. That's how fast my heart beats when I imagine you reading this. When you say yes, I predict it'll hit 180. When you say no, it'll probably stop.\n\nEither way, you should know: you've been statistically improbable from the start. My beautiful outlier. My favorite error. My proof that the universe makes mistakes in our favor sometimes.\n\nYours in standard deviations from normal,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder. Oat milk, half pump vanilla, exactly 147\u00b0F (optimal drinking temperature based on 73 trials). I've been perfecting it for four months. This is my real proposal. Everything else is just context.\n\nP.P.S. The street lamp just stopped flickering. Even it knows this is it. This is my moment to hand you this letter and then probably vomit from anxiety. But it'll be statistically significant vomit. The most important vomit of my life.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "d1946736-3bb7-40c1-bd35-fe3d097a4903", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701403.301209, "iteration_found": 97, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.7040000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.69, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in my car.

The letter exists in the crucial gap between exceptional contemporary work (65-69) and the historical masterpieces (80+), showing flashes of genius (\"I love you like a broken hallelujah\") while occasionally succumbing to contemporary workshop aesthetics.

When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains. I already love the way you'll mispronounce \"specifically\" when you tell this story later.

Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi.

Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache.

What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone.

Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought your coffee creamer for next month.\n\nAll my love (which is to say, everything),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7320)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nRight now you're in the next room, humming off-key to a song you've never learned the words to. I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.\n\nThis is my twentieth attempt. The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you.

You're asleep upstairs, one leg kicked free of the blankets, making that small sound that isn't quite a snore but I'd testify in court that it is. I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains. I already love the way you'll mispronounce \"specifically\" when you tell this story later.

I Wikipedia their lyrics before you come over. I bought a plant because you said men who keep plants alive are trustworthy, and I've replaced it three times without telling you. The current one is plastic. You haven't noticed.\n\nThat's the kind of liar I am. Small lies. Pathetic lies. Except for this one enormous truth that's eating me alive: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't love me back.\n\nI know that's dramatic. I know it's too much. But you did this to me. Three weeks after we met, I threw out all my backup plans. The other numbers in my phone. The exit strategies I'd been building since I was seventeen and learned that people leave. You walked into my life and I forgot I was supposed to protect myself from you.\n\nHere's what loving you actually is: It's me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt so bad when you didn't text back for three hours. It's crying in a Walgreens parking lot because they were playing that song you hummed while making eggs. It's finding one of your hairs on my jacket and keeping it in my wallet like some kind of serial killer. It's being absolutely terrified that you'll read this and run, and being more terrified that I won't send it and you'll never know.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower\u2014not because I want to fight, but because I need to be prepared for the day you realize I'm not enough. I've already forgiven you for leaving me, and you haven't even thought about it yet. That's how sure I am that I don't deserve this.\n\nBut God, Leyi, the way you eat cereal at midnight. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. How you pretend you're not crying during insurance commercials. The fact that you named your car Eleanor Roosevelt. These stupid, perfect things have ruined me for anyone else. You've made me unfit for any life that doesn't have you in it.\n\nI don't know how to be romantic. I know how to be destroyed by you. I know that yesterday you wore the blue sweater that makes your eyes look like science fiction, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom because I couldn't breathe right. I know that when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one\u2014you snort a little, and it's the best sound I've ever heard. I know I would listen to you read the phone book. I have, actually, listened to you read nutrition labels, and found it riveting.\n\nThis is me without armor: I am thirty-one years old and I only just started living the day I met you. Everything before that was just marking time. \n\nMarry me. Not because I'm good enough\u2014I'm not. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I can't. But because I'm already yours in every way that matters. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption that you'll be there.

This is what you don't see: me at 3 AM, practicing this moment in my head, each rehearsal worse than the last because no arrangement of words equals the weight of what moves through me when I think of you.\n\nListen. I need to tell you about the ordinary Wednesday that broke me. You were sick. Fevered. You asked me to read to you and fell asleep mid-sentence, your breathing ragged but trusting. I sat there holding the book, afraid to move, afraid to disturb this impossible gift of your unconscious faith in my presence. That's when I understood: love isn't the big moments. It's me googling \"how to make fever go down\" at 2 AM. It's the twenty-seven tissues I counted in the trash. It's how beautiful you looked dying of the flu, which is an insane thought I'm putting in a proposal letter because you wanted truth.\n\nTruth: I've been taking secret photos of your hands. Not in a creepy way. Just\u2014your hands doing things. Holding coffee. Turning pages. That unconscious gesture where you touch your neck when you're thinking. I have 1,847 photos. They're saved in a folder called \"Tax Documents\" because I'm a coward and a fraud but at least I'm your coward, your fraud, if you'll have me.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologized last week for \"being a lot.\" But Leyi, you're not a lot\u2014you're everything. You're the first person I want to tell when anything happens. You're my favorite notification. You're the reason I believe in reincarnation, because one lifetime of you isn't enough data to understand the algorithm of how you make me feel.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: sometimes I watch you exist\u2014brushing your teeth, arguing with podcast hosts who can't hear you, the way you eat raspberries one tiny segment at a time like you're defusing a bomb\u2014and I get this pain in my chest. Not heartbreak. Heart-expansion. Like my ribs are trying to grow a bigger cage for all this feeling.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I'm just a man who can't fold fitted sheets, who still uses the same password for everything, who loves you with the graceless intensity of someone who never expected to be chosen. But here's the thing\u2014I'd rather fail at deserving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nI used to think I was saving up for something. Turns out I was saving up for you. For rings, yes, but also for Saturday mornings where we do nothing productive. For the specific way you'll sigh when I make the same joke for the fiftieth time. For the fights we'll have about whether AI will destroy humanity (you say yes, I say only if we're lucky). For the chance to be the person who knows you're afraid of the dark but more afraid of admitting it.\n\nThis letter is too long. You're probably rolling your eyes. But I need you to know: you haven't made me better. You've made me more myself. The self that was always there, waiting for someone who'd look at my collection of orphaned charging cables and still choose to love me.\n\nSo here it is, without metaphor: Will you marry me? Will you let me love you with receipts and evidence and the kind of dedication usually reserved for people who build ships in bottles? Will you be my wife, my witness, my favorite reason to check my phone?\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons and Thursday nights and all the unremarkable moments that add up to a life. I'm promising to try, fail, try again, and keep the receipts from every attempt.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the molecular structure of my existence.

Actually broken. Like last Tuesday when you went to visit your sister and I stood in our kitchen at 2 AM eating cereal from the box because making a bowl felt pointless if you weren't there to steal bites from it.\n\nI'm supposed to tell you how you complete me, but that's backwards. You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.\n\nDo you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.\n\nThat's disgusting. I know. But it's true.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.\n\nThis is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop.

You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.\n\nI will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.\n\nI am terrified you'll say no.

Not romantically\u2014mathematically. I've calculated our mortgage at different interest rates. I've researched schools for children we haven't had. I know which hospitals are closest to every apartment we might live in. I've written my vows seventeen times. I practice them in traffic. Other drivers think I'm on Bluetooth. I'm not. I'm just insane about you.\n\nRemember when you found me sobbing in the shower last month? I said it was work stress. It wasn't. I'd just realized that statistically, based on actuarial tables, I'll probably die first. And I spent forty minutes crying about leaving you alone, about you having to learn how the thermostat works, about someone else discovering that you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad.\n\nYou should know: I'm not a good person. I judge people who walk slowly. I pretend to recycle but sometimes don't. I hate your best friend's laugh. But you make me want to deserve you. Not be better\u2014that's abstract. But deserve you, specifically. Like there's a ledger somewhere and I need to balance it through accumulated acts of devotion.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for 127 days. I know because there's an app. It tracks how many times I've almost proposed (643) versus how many times I've chickened out (643). Today makes 644 or possibly 1, depending on if you say yes.\n\nThe inside of the ring\u2014you can't see this in photos\u2014is engraved with the coordinates of where we met. Not romantic coordinates like Paris or sunset beach. A Walgreens parking lot. 34.0522\u00b0N, 118.2437\u00b0W. Where you were buying toilet paper and I was buying shame-candy at 11 PM and you said \"nice selection\" and my brain just... stopped. Reformatted. Rebooted with you as the operating system.\n\nHere's what I'm actually saying: I don't love you like a poet or a philosopher. I love you like a scientist who's discovered something that breaks all known laws. Like an accountant who's found an error in reality's books that somehow makes everything balance better. Like a madman who's so specifically insane that it loops back around to sanity.\n\nI need you to know that if you say no, I've already planned for that too. There's a contingency file. I'll move to Portland. I'll get a cat. I'll learn pottery. I'll become someone who can live without you. But it'll be like living without my liver. Technically possible but really just slow-motion dying.\n\nBut if you say yes? If you say yes, I have seventeen years of Tuesday dinners planned. I have a list of 247 inside jokes we haven't made yet. I have your surprise 40th birthday party already sketched out (your sister's in on it, don't tell her I told you). I have so much stupid, obsessive, mathematically documented love that I could fill servers with it.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though I hope it does, I ran it through sentiment analysis and it scored high. Marry me because I've already integrated you into my source code. Because I love you with the kind of precision that's indistinguishable from madness. Because I've turned devotion into data science and somehow that makes it more true, not less.\n\nI just checked my heart rate monitor. 147 BPM. That's how fast my heart beats when I imagine you reading this. When you say yes, I predict it'll hit 180. When you say no, it'll probably stop.\n\nEither way, you should know: you've been statistically improbable from the start. My beautiful outlier. My favorite error. My proof that the universe makes mistakes in our favor sometimes.\n\nYours in standard deviations from normal,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder. Oat milk, half pump vanilla, exactly 147\u00b0F (optimal drinking temperature based on 73 trials). I've been perfecting it for four months. This is my real proposal. Everything else is just context.\n\nP.P.S. The street lamp just stopped flickering. Even it knows this is it. This is my moment to hand you this letter and then probably vomit from anxiety. But it'll be statistically significant vomit. The most important vomit of my life.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
