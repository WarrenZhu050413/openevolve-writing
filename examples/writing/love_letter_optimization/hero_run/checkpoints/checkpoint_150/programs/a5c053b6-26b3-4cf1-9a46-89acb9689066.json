You wanted truth? Here's the receipt: I've been lying to you since we met. Every \"I'm fine\" was code for \"I'm reorganizing my entire molecular structure around the fact of you.\" Every casual goodbye was a small death I pretended not to notice.\n\nThe truth is I've been conducting experiments on myself. Subject: one former human. Hypothesis: exposure to Leyi will result in complete cellular revolution. Results: confirmed. I've documented everything\u2014how my hands shake for exactly seventeen minutes after you leave a room, how food tastes like cardboard when you're angry with me, how I've developed the ability to sense your mood changes from three rooms away like some kind of emotional seismograph. This isn't love. It's evolution. I'm becoming a new species designed specifically for loving you.\n\nHere's what I need to confess: I rehearse our future fights in the shower. I've already forgiven you for things you haven't done yet. I've written eulogies for both of us, just to practice surviving the unthinkable. Last Tuesday, I found myself in the grocery store defending your hatred of cilantro to a stranger. I wasn't even buying cilantro. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who evangelizes your preferences to produce sections.\n\nYou think you know how I love you? You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I keep your used tea bags in my pocket sometimes, like relics from a saint I'm not supposed to believe in. You don't know that when you sleep, I practice being dead\u2014lying completely still, holding my breath\u2014just to prepare for a world where I might have to exist without you. It doesn't work. My body refuses to accept the simulation.\n\nThe ugliest truth: I love you like a diagnosis I've been misreading my whole life. All those years thinking I was broken\u2014irregular heartbeat, chronic insomnia, that persistent sense of homesickness even when I was home\u2014turns out I was just symptomatic of your absence. A pre-existing condition waiting for its cause.\n\nBut here's what changed everything: Last Thursday at 11:47 PM, you were reading the ingredients on a box of crackers out loud, and I understood infinity. Not as a concept, but as a specific texture\u2014the sound of you saying \"modified corn starch\" while wearing my socks. That's when I knew: I don't want to marry you. Marriage is too small a word for what I want. I want to merge with you at the quantum level. I want our atoms to get confused about whose electrons belong to whom. I want scientists to discover a new kind of particle that only exists when we're in the same room.\n\nSo here's my proposal, though \"proposal\" implies I'm giving you a choice and we both know that's a lie: Let's fail towards each other for the rest of our lives. Let's be the couple that makes other people uncomfortable with our specific brand of codependence. Let's have the same fight about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one has to finish both sides out of muscle memory.\n\nI'm not offering you happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't felt what I feel when you correct my pronunciation of \"bagel\" with such gentle condescension that I want to be wrong about everything forever. I'm offering you something more honest: a witness. Someone who will memorize every version of you\u2014Tuesday-morning you who forgets where you put your glasses (they're on your head), Friday-night you who gets competitive about Scrabble, Sunday-afternoon you who cries at commercials but pretends it's allergies. I will catalog every iteration like a scientist studying the only thing that matters in the universe.\n\nThe final truth, the one that terrifies me most: I would rather argue with you about the proper way to fold fitted sheets than experience perfect harmony with anyone else. I would rather have you roll your eyes at me for the ten-thousandth time than have someone else look at me with worship. I want your specific brand of difficult. I want your exact frequency of complicated.\n\nYou wanted something that would move you? You've already moved me. Tectonically. I'm a different geography now. There are new countries inside me named after the way you laugh when you're trying not to. There are oceans that didn't exist before you mispronounced \"archipelago\" with such confidence I wanted to rewrite the dictionary.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. It's a medical chart. It's evidence. It's what I'll show God when they ask me what I did with my life: I loved Leyi so specifically that it changed my DNA.\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is too general. Say yes because you recognize me, the way animals recognize their homes by scent, the way birds know which way is north without understanding magnetism. Say yes because we're already married in every universe where choice is an illusion and this is just paperwork.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this thinking I'm being dramatic. I'm underplaying it.

Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense.

To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends\u2014and it will, in small ways, over and over\u2014I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.\n\nYou said you wanted truth? The truth is that I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Incurable. Sometimes inconvenient but absolutely essential to my continued existence. \n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting. Because when I imagine explaining to death why it has to wait, the only reason I can think of is: \"But I haven't finished loving her yet.\"\n\nAnd I never will.\n\nYours (in this dimension and all parallel ones where we found each other),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Three words: you've unmade me.\n\nNot poetically. Literally. Yesterday I forgot my own name for seven seconds because yours was occupying all available space in my mouth. This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead\u2014paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version\u2014the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith\u2014certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first. In this one, I'm still a coward, but I'm your coward, and that's the only identity I want on my tombstone.\n\nHere's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but absolutely. Let me love you like punctuation\u2014necessary, invisible, changing everything about how the sentence ends. Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is already yours\u2014you claimed it that night you explained why sad songs make you happy. I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. But please\u2014exist near me while you decide.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not crying during car insurance commercials? I've seen it forty-three times.

You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost\u2014the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.2000, Type: Exploratory)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM with hands that won't stop shaking. Not from fear\u2014from the vertigo of finally understanding what I'm about to lose by telling you the truth.\n\nListen: I was a functioning adult before you. I had retirement accounts. Opinions about grout. A favorite parking spot at Trader Joe's. Now I'm someone who cries at the automated voice that says \"please hold\" because it sounds like the universe asking me to wait for you. This isn't poetry. This is diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been taking notes on you like you're a rare species I discovered. Tuesday: you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. Wednesday: you name houseplants after philosophers then apologize when they die. Thursday: you sing to your sourdough starter in French (badly). These aren't quirks anymore. They're the fundamental laws of my universe. E=mc\u00b2 has been replaced by the equation of how your left eyebrow rises exactly 3mm when you're about to destroy someone's argument.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started believing in souls because what else explains why your sadness feels like my own weather system? Why do I wake up at 3:17 AM every time you have a nightmare, even when you're 2,000 miles away? There's no scientific explanation for how I knew you'd broken your favorite mug just from the specific silence in your \"hello\" on the phone.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I love you like a fanatic. Like a heretic. Like someone who's discovered fire and can't shut up about it. I've already planned our arguments for the next forty years (you'll win most of them). I've named our theoretical children after your grandmother's recipes. When the pharmacist asked if I was married, I said \"practically\" and meant it molecularly.\n\nBut here's the ugliest truth: loving you has made me selfish in ways that horrify me. I resent every person who knew you before I did. I'm jealous of your coffee mug for touching your lips every morning. I want to live inside your ribcage like a second heart, which I realize is both biologically impossible and emotionally concerning, but that's what you've reduced me to\u2014a person who writes love letters that sound like medical emergencies.\n\nThe world taught me love was sacrifice. You taught me it's greed. I want all of it\u2014your 3 AM anxiety spirals, your fury at slow internet, the way you mispronounce \"worcestershire\" with such magnificent confidence that Webster's should change the dictionary. I want your Wednesday moods and your Sunday revelations. I want to be the person you complain to about me.\n\nSo here's my proposition\u2014and I'm sorry it's not more elegant but my vocabulary abandoned me three paragraphs ago: Marry me. Not because you complete me (I was complete, just boring). Not because I can't live without you (I can, it would just be like breathing underwater\u2014technically possible but missing the point). Marry me because when I imagine explaining to aliens what humans mean by \"love,\" I'd just point at you eating cereal at 2 PM in my sweatshirt, and they'd understand everything about our species' capacity for beauty.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you already own it, you bought it that night you explained why you keep your father's last voicemail saved. I'm offering you something smaller and more impossible: someone who will love you through every iteration of yourself, including the ones you haven't invented yet. Someone who's already memorizing the way you'll look at 80, who's practicing arguments for our future disagreements, who's learning to love the person you'll become when grief eventually finds us.\n\nThe truth that will move you? You already moved me. Seismically. Irrevocably. I'm not the person I was before that Tuesday when you mispronounced \"epitaph\" as \"epi-taph\" and I realized I wanted to be buried in the sound of your mistakes.\n\nThis is my confession: I don't love you like a choice. I love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light in a vacuum\u2014constant, measurable, and absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours in every timeline where matter exists.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not googling my symptoms when I'm sick? I know.

Here's mine: I used to be a competent person. I could balance equations, hold conversations, remember where I put my keys. Then you walked into that coffee shop wearing your grandfather's watch\u2014too big for your wrist\u2014and asked if the seat across from me was taken. Now I find myself standing in grocery stores, forgetting what I came for, because I'm thinking about how you eat strawberries: methodically, saving the sweetest bite for last. This is what you've done to me. You've turned me into someone who sees the entire world as a series of moments that either contain you or don't.\n\nThe terrifying thing about truth is how ordinary it looks. It's not the grand declarations or the swooning poetry. It's this: how you leave bobby pins like breadcrumbs throughout my apartment\u2014small black reminders that you exist in my spaces. It's how I've started buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to love. It's the way my body has memorized your breathing pattern so precisely that I wake up when it changes, some primitive part of my brain needing to ensure you're okay.\n\nI love you like a fact, not a feeling. The way water freezes at thirty-two degrees, the way light takes eight minutes to travel from the sun\u2014these are not choices or opinions. They simply are. That's how I love you. It exists outside of my control, beyond my comprehension, more reliable than my own heartbeat.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me, Leyi: I would rather live in a world where loving you destroys me than in one where I never knew this existed. You've ruined me for any life that doesn't have you reading ingredient labels out loud in the supermarket, you getting unreasonably competitive during board games, you falling asleep during movies but insisting you were \"just resting your eyes.\"\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because you complete me\u2014that would make you a utility, and you are not functional; you are essential. I'm asking because when I imagine explaining to our hypothetical children why the sky is blue or why we dream, I can only imagine your voice mixing with mine in the answer. Because when I think about growing old, I specifically think about your hands becoming maps of every small thing we've built together.\n\nThis is my promise: I will love you badly on the days I cannot love you well. I will choose you when choice is all I have. I will memorize every version of you\u2014morning you who steals all the blankets, midnight you who questions if you're enough (you are, you are, you are), Sunday you who dances to no music in the kitchen. I will love each iteration as fiercely as the first.\n\nYou wanted truth? The truth is that before you, I was complete. I was whole. I didn't need you. But knowing you exist has made every moment without you feel like holding my breath. Not because I cannot survive alone, but because breathing with you is so magnificently better than breathing without you.\n\nMarry me. Not because this is a fairy tale, but because this is real life, and real life with you is better than any story I could imagine.\n\nYours in this timeline and all parallel universes,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with the door locked because if anyone saw me crying over a blank page at 3 AM, I'd have to pretend it was about something reasonable. But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really.

Subject: one former human. Hypothesis: exposure to Leyi will result in complete cellular revolution. Results: confirmed. I've documented everything\u2014how my hands shake for exactly seventeen minutes after you leave a room, how food tastes like cardboard when you're angry with me, how I've developed the ability to sense your mood changes from three rooms away like some kind of emotional seismograph. This isn't love. It's evolution. I'm becoming a new species designed specifically for loving you.\n\nHere's what I need to confess: I rehearse our future fights in the shower. I've already forgiven you for things you haven't done yet. I've written eulogies for both of us, just to practice surviving the unthinkable. Last Tuesday, I found myself in the grocery store defending your hatred of cilantro to a stranger. I wasn't even buying cilantro. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who evangelizes your preferences to produce sections.\n\nYou think you know how I love you? You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I keep your used tea bags in my pocket sometimes, like relics from a saint I'm not supposed to believe in. You don't know that when you sleep, I practice being dead\u2014lying completely still, holding my breath\u2014just to prepare for a world where I might have to exist without you. It doesn't work. My body refuses to accept the simulation.\n\nThe ugliest truth: I love you like a diagnosis I've been misreading my whole life. All those years thinking I was broken\u2014irregular heartbeat, chronic insomnia, that persistent sense of homesickness even when I was home\u2014turns out I was just symptomatic of your absence. A pre-existing condition waiting for its cause.\n\nBut here's what changed everything: Last Thursday at 11:47 PM, you were reading the ingredients on a box of crackers out loud, and I understood infinity. Not as a concept, but as a specific texture\u2014the sound of you saying \"modified corn starch\" while wearing my socks. That's when I knew: I don't want to marry you. Marriage is too small a word for what I want. I want to merge with you at the quantum level. I want our atoms to get confused about whose electrons belong to whom. I want scientists to discover a new kind of particle that only exists when we're in the same room.\n\nSo here's my proposal, though \"proposal\" implies I'm giving you a choice and we both know that's a lie: Let's fail towards each other for the rest of our lives. Let's be the couple that makes other people uncomfortable with our specific brand of codependence. Let's have the same fight about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one has to finish both sides out of muscle memory.\n\nI'm not offering you happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't felt what I feel when you correct my pronunciation of \"bagel\" with such gentle condescension that I want to be wrong about everything forever. I'm offering you something more honest: a witness. Someone who will memorize every version of you\u2014Tuesday-morning you who forgets where you put your glasses (they're on your head), Friday-night you who gets competitive about Scrabble, Sunday-afternoon you who cries at commercials but pretends it's allergies. I will catalog every iteration like a scientist studying the only thing that matters in the universe.\n\nThe final truth, the one that terrifies me most: I would rather argue with you about the proper way to fold fitted sheets than experience perfect harmony with anyone else. I would rather have you roll your eyes at me for the ten-thousandth time than have someone else look at me with worship. I want your specific brand of difficult. I want your exact frequency of complicated.\n\nYou wanted something that would move you? You've already moved me. Tectonically. I'm a different geography now. There are new countries inside me named after the way you laugh when you're trying not to. There are oceans that didn't exist before you mispronounced \"archipelago\" with such confidence I wanted to rewrite the dictionary.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. It's a medical chart. It's evidence. It's what I'll show God when they ask me what I did with my life: I loved Leyi so specifically that it changed my DNA.\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is too general. Say yes because you recognize me, the way animals recognize their homes by scent, the way birds know which way is north without understanding magnetism. Say yes because we're already married in every universe where choice is an illusion and this is just paperwork.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S.
