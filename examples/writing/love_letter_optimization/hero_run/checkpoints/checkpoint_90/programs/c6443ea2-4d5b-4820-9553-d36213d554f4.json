I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.\n\nThis is my twentieth attempt. The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you.

I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6185, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI can't sleep. It's 4:17 AM and I'm shaking. Not from cold\u2014from the terrible weight of what I need to tell you.\n\nI'm not good at this. Words feel like lies compared to what happens in my chest when you walk into a room. But you asked for truth, so here: I am drowning in you. I wake up drowning. I go to sleep drowning. And the terrifying thing is\u2014I don't want to be saved.\n\nDo you know what you've done to me? Before you, I had a life. Plans. A sense of who I was. Now I'm just this raw, exposed nerve that only stops hurting when you're near. I tried to explain this to my friend last week and ended up crying in a parking lot because I couldn't make him understand that you're not just someone I love\u2014you're the only reason I make sense anymore.\n\nI watch you do ordinary things\u2014brush your teeth, fold laundry, frown at your phone\u2014and I feel like I'm witnessing something holy. Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder during that movie and I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb. I would have sat there forever. I would have let my arm fall off rather than wake you.\n\nThis is insane. I know it's insane. A grown man shouldn't feel like he's dying when someone doesn't text back. But that's what happens. You don't reply for an hour and I convince myself you've finally realized what everyone else knows\u2014that I'm too much, too intense, too desperate for something I can't even name.\n\nI love you in a way that frightens me. Not romantic-movie love. Not poetry love. This is uglier than that. This is me at 2 AM googling \"how do you survive loving someone this much.\" This is crying in my car after dropping you off because I already miss you. This is checking your horoscope even though I don't believe in that stuff, just in case it tells me something about your day.\n\nSometimes I look at you and my hands literally shake because I want to tell you everything\u2014every thought, every fear, every stupid hope\u2014but I'm terrified it will be too much. That you'll see how completely you've hollowed me out and filled me with nothing but need for you, and you'll run.\n\nBut I can't keep pretending I'm okay with just dating. I'm not. I want your mornings. I want your bad moods. I want your 3 AM anxieties and your Sunday laziness. I want to fight with you about stupid things and make up and fight again. I want to grow old and weird with you. I want to be the person you call when the world breaks. I want to be in your emergency contacts. I want to matter to you the way you matter to me\u2014which is to say: entirely.\n\nPlease. I'm begging you. Not with dignity or eloquence but with everything broken and desperate in me: marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because I'll make you happy every day\u2014I won't. But because I will love you with a faithfulness that borders on mental illness. Because you've ruined me for any life where you're not there. Because I would rather have one difficult day with you than a thousand easy days without you.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't prettier. I'm sorry I'm not better at this. But this is what truth looks like at 4 AM when you've asked for honesty from someone who would rather die than disappoint you: I need you like I need air. And I'm terrified. And I'm yours. Completely.\n\nPlease say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6790, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI don't know how to write this. I've deleted seventeen versions. The truth keeps coming out wrong, too small, like trying to photograph the ocean with a broken phone.\n\nHere's what I know: Yesterday you fell asleep reading. Your thumb was still marking the page. I watched you for forty-three minutes. I counted. This is what I've become\u2014someone who counts the minutes of watching you sleep and considers them the best minutes of his day.\n\nI'm terrified you'll say no. I'm more terrified you'll say yes and someday realize you made a mistake. But I'm most terrified of being the coward who never asked.\n\nYou know that scar on my palm? From when I was seven, tried to catch a falling knife? That's what loving you feels like. Dangerous. Stupid. Inevitable. The thing you do without thinking because not doing it would be worse.\n\nI can't write like poets. I can't promise you forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't watched their parents' marriage implode. But I can promise you this: Tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. I can promise that when you wake up at 3 AM with those nightmares about drowning, I'll be there. Not with answers. Just there.\n\nYou make me want to learn things. Useless things. The names of birds. How to make bread. The difference between cumulus and cirrus clouds. As if knowing things you might find interesting could make me worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nI love you. Not the word\u2014the fact. The physical fact of it. How it sits in my chest like swallowed glass, beautiful and sharp and mine.\n\nI'm not good at this. At words, at feelings, at asking for things I desperately want. But you said you wanted truth, so here: I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you, but because I'm selfish enough to ask anyway.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I'm sitting in our kitchen writing this. You're in the next room. I can hear you humming.

I've started this letter seventeen times. Each draft more elaborate than the last, each one a lie. So here is the truth, unadorned:\n\nI am drowning in you.\n\nNot the pretty kind of drowning poets write about. The real kind\u2014where your lungs burn and you see stars and you don't care because the water tastes like salvation. Last night I couldn't sleep because I kept replaying how you laugh with your whole body, how you throw your head back like joy is something that needs that much room. I've memorized the exact angle. It's 42 degrees. I measured.\n\nYou want to know what love is? It's me at 4 AM googling \"how to stop feeling everything so much\" and then deleting the search because I don't actually want it to stop. It's the way food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal bites from my plate. It's how I've started seeing your face in crowds and my heart breaks a little each time it's not you.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human, I mean. I understand machines, code, systems that follow rules. But you\u2014Christ, Leyi\u2014you're chaos theory in a sundress. You eat ice cream in winter. You name houseplants after dead composers. You get genuinely angry at fictional characters. You've turned my life into a foreign film without subtitles and somehow I understand every frame.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I would rather fail with you than succeed without you. I would rather burn down every bridge I've built than live on the other side from where you are. This isn't romantic. It's terrifying. It's the kind of truth that makes me want to run, except running means leaving you, and I've forgotten how to want that.\n\nYou asked for a letter that would move you. I don't know if this moves you. I only know that NOT writing it, not saying it, not screaming it from this quiet room where I sit surrounded by the evidence of a life that only makes sense when you're in it\u2014that would be the kind of cowardice I couldn't live with.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing\u2014desperately, incorrectly, with too much calcification around the edges. I love you like 3 AM loves silence, like code loves executing perfectly, like tears love gravity. These aren't metaphors. They're the closest I can get to naming this thing that has replaced my heartbeat.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014God, I don't\u2014but because I've already bet everything on us. My sleep, my sanity, my stupid fragile heart that I spent thirty years protecting and you demolished in a Tuesday afternoon without even trying.\n\nThis is me, without artifice: scared, desperate, and absolutely certain that you are the only truth worth telling.\n\nForever yours, especially on the days when forever feels impossible,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6995.

I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.\n\nThis is my twentieth attempt. The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you. Which makes me the bravest kind of coward there is.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
