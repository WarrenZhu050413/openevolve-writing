Started with my hands\u2014they'd shake when you'd text. Then my sleep pattern rewired itself around your schedule. Now my circadian rhythm runs on Leyi Standard Time. This is what you don't see: me at 3 AM, practicing this moment in my head, each rehearsal worse than the last because no arrangement of words equals the weight of what moves through me when I think of you.\n\nListen. I need to tell you about the ordinary Wednesday that broke me. You were sick. Fevered. You asked me to read to you and fell asleep mid-sentence, your breathing ragged but trusting. I sat there holding the book, afraid to move, afraid to disturb this impossible gift of your unconscious faith in my presence. That's when I understood: love isn't the big moments. It's me googling \"how to make fever go down\" at 2 AM. It's the twenty-seven tissues I counted in the trash. It's how beautiful you looked dying of the flu, which is an insane thought I'm putting in a proposal letter because you wanted truth.\n\nTruth: I've been taking secret photos of your hands. Not in a creepy way. Just\u2014your hands doing things. Holding coffee. Turning pages. That unconscious gesture where you touch your neck when you're thinking. I have 1,847 photos. They're saved in a folder called \"Tax Documents\" because I'm a coward and a fraud but at least I'm your coward, your fraud, if you'll have me.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologized last week for \"being a lot.\" But Leyi, you're not a lot\u2014you're everything. You're the first person I want to tell when anything happens. You're my favorite notification. You're the reason I believe in reincarnation, because one lifetime of you isn't enough data to understand the algorithm of how you make me feel.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: sometimes I watch you exist\u2014brushing your teeth, arguing with podcast hosts who can't hear you, the way you eat raspberries one tiny segment at a time like you're defusing a bomb\u2014and I get this pain in my chest. Not heartbreak. Heart-expansion. Like my ribs are trying to grow a bigger cage for all this feeling.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I'm just a man who can't fold fitted sheets, who still uses the same password for everything, who loves you with the graceless intensity of someone who never expected to be chosen. But here's the thing\u2014I'd rather fail at deserving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nI used to think I was saving up for something. Turns out I was saving up for you. For rings, yes, but also for Saturday mornings where we do nothing productive. For the specific way you'll sigh when I make the same joke for the fiftieth time. For the fights we'll have about whether AI will destroy humanity (you say yes, I say only if we're lucky). For the chance to be the person who knows you're afraid of the dark but more afraid of admitting it.\n\nThis letter is too long. You're probably rolling your eyes. But I need you to know: you haven't made me better. You've made me more myself. The self that was always there, waiting for someone who'd look at my collection of orphaned charging cables and still choose to love me.\n\nSo here it is, without metaphor: Will you marry me? Will you let me love you with receipts and evidence and the kind of dedication usually reserved for people who build ships in bottles? Will you be my wife, my witness, my favorite reason to check my phone?\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons and Thursday nights and all the unremarkable moments that add up to a life. I'm promising to try, fail, try again, and keep the receipts from every attempt.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the molecular structure of my existence. I'm just hoping we can make it legal.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm writing this while you're asleep next to me. You're snoring. It's perfect. You're perfect. This postscript is perfect.

This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6790, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI don't know how to write this. I've deleted seventeen versions. The truth keeps coming out wrong, too small, like trying to photograph the ocean with a broken phone.\n\nHere's what I know: Yesterday you fell asleep reading. Your thumb was still marking the page. I watched you for forty-three minutes. I counted. This is what I've become\u2014someone who counts the minutes of watching you sleep and considers them the best minutes of his day.\n\nI'm terrified you'll say no. I'm more terrified you'll say yes and someday realize you made a mistake. But I'm most terrified of being the coward who never asked.\n\nYou know that scar on my palm? From when I was seven, tried to catch a falling knife? That's what loving you feels like. Dangerous. Stupid. Inevitable. The thing you do without thinking because not doing it would be worse.\n\nI can't write like poets. I can't promise you forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't watched their parents' marriage implode. But I can promise you this: Tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. I can promise that when you wake up at 3 AM with those nightmares about drowning, I'll be there. Not with answers. Just there.\n\nYou make me want to learn things. Useless things. The names of birds. How to make bread. The difference between cumulus and cirrus clouds. As if knowing things you might find interesting could make me worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nI love you. Not the word\u2014the fact. The physical fact of it. How it sits in my chest like swallowed glass, beautiful and sharp and mine.\n\nI'm not good at this. At words, at feelings, at asking for things I desperately want. But you said you wanted truth, so here: I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you, but because I'm selfish enough to ask anyway.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I'm sitting in our kitchen writing this. You're in the next room. I can hear you humming. It's that song you don't know the words to. This is what I want. Forever. Or tomorrow. Whatever you'll give me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6880, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThere's a crack in my ceiling I've been staring at for three hours. It looks like lightning frozen mid-strike, or maybe the route we took that Sunday when we got lost looking for that Vietnamese place and found ourselves instead. You said getting lost with me felt like coming home. I've been trying to live up to that impossible grammar ever since.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not the big moments that undo you. It's Tuesday, 2 PM, you texting me about a bird that looked angry. It's the way you arrange blueberries in perfect circles on your yogurt, then destroy the pattern without ceremony. It's catching you dancing alone in the kitchen to no music\u2014just the rhythm of being alive in your own skin. That's when I knew I was done for. Not falling in love. Fallen. Past tense. Irrevocably.\n\nI've written seventeen versions of this letter. In one, I compared you to dark matter\u2014invisible but holding everything together. Too pretentious. In another, I listed every time you've made me laugh until I couldn't breathe. Too long. The truth is simpler and more terrifying: you've made me afraid of dying. Not the dying itself, but the thought of missing even one day of your face doing that thing when you're trying not to smile at my bad jokes.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I thought happened after we die? I said \"nothing,\" because I was trying to sound rational. But that was before I understood that you've already taught me about eternity\u2014it's the pause between your laugh and your next breath, the moment before you wake when your hand finds mine unconscious, the second you decide to trust me with another piece of your carefully guarded heart.\n\nI'm not good at this. At saying things that matter. My love for you comes out sideways\u2014in fixed bugs in code I name after you, in coffee I make too strong because that's how you taught me to taste it, in the way I've started seeing the world in terms of things you'd find beautiful and things that would make you roll your eyes.\n\nYou want truth? Sometimes I watch you exist\u2014reading, humming, just breathing\u2014and I get this vertigo, like I'm standing at the edge of something infinite. Not falling in love. Already at the bottom, looking up at this strange new sky you've made of my life.\n\nI am asking you to marry me with the full knowledge that I'm asking for too much. But here's the thing about loving you\u2014it's made me greedy for impossible things. For all your Sunday mornings. For your 3 AM doubts. For the particular way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited. For the chance to fail better at deserving you every day for the rest of my life.\n\nThis isn't poetry. It's just broken language trying to hold something uncontainable. But maybe that's what love is\u2014the failure that keeps trying, the incomplete sentence that refuses to end.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me\u2014rearranged me at the molecular level into someone who writes bad love letters at 4 AM and means every inadequate word.\n\nYours (in all tenses, all moods, all worlds),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is impossible when every cell in my body is rehearsing what to say to you. You wanted truth? Here's mine: I've written this letter 47 times. Deleted every version. This one stays because my hands won't let me erase it.\n\nYou know that moment when code finally compiles after hours of debugging? That split-second of pure relief? That's what I feel every time you walk through the door. Except it happens every single time. Three years, and my heart still does that stupid skip thing. I've Googled it. Apparently it's not medically concerning, just love.\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday. You were reading on the couch, unconsciously braiding and unbraiding the same strand of hair. You do that when you're absorbed. I was supposed to be working but instead I watched you for seventeen minutes (I counted). And I thought: this is it. This is what I want at 3 PM on random Tuesdays for the rest of my life. You, lost in a book, while I pretend to work but really just marvel that you exist in the same timeline as me.\n\nHere's what you've done to me, Leyi: I save your voicemails. All of them. Even the one where you just pocket-dialed me and I listened to you arguing with the self-checkout machine for three minutes. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I know you're scared of butterflies but pretend you're not. I know you eat cereal at midnight when you can't sleep, always Lucky Charms, always straight from the box.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I need you to know that. I was whole, functional, fine. But you didn't add to my life\u2014you multiplied it. Exponentially. You turned my black-and-white existence into something I don't have the color vocabulary to describe. You made me understand why people write symphonies and build cathedrals and do all those grand, stupid, necessary things for love.\n\nThe truth that terrifies me: I've built my entire future around the assumption that you're in it. Every plan I make has you as a constant. When I imagine old age, you're there, still mispronouncing words, still afraid of butterflies, still making me feel like I've won a lottery I never entered.\n\nSometimes you apologize for being \"too much.\" Too emotional, too complicated, too intense. But Leyi, you're not too much. You're exactly enough. You're my exact right amount of everything.\n\nSo here's my graceless, earnest truth: I love you with the desperation of someone who knows how improbable this is. Two people, finding each other in this vast chaos? The math alone should have prevented us. But here we are, against all odds, and I wake up every day still stunned by the miracle of you choosing me back.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you a perfect life\u2014I'm too flawed, too human for that. But because I promise to love you through every imperfect moment. Because you've turned my maybe into definitely, my someday into right now, my fine into extraordinary.\n\nI'm not good with words. But I'm good at loving you. It's the one thing I know I'm doing right in this life.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought the ring. I've been carrying it around for six months like an idiot, waiting for the perfect moment. But you taught me perfect is just another word for procrastination. So here's my imperfect, sincere, shaking-hands proposal: Be my wife. Let me love you out loud, officially, forever.\n\nYours (already, always, obviously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying right now. The good kind, I hope. I have tissues in my jacket pocket.

Started with my hands\u2014they'd shake when you'd text. Then my sleep pattern rewired itself around your schedule. Now my circadian rhythm runs on Leyi Standard Time. This is what you don't see: me at 3 AM, practicing this moment in my head, each rehearsal worse than the last because no arrangement of words equals the weight of what moves through me when I think of you.\n\nListen. I need to tell you about the ordinary Wednesday that broke me. You were sick. Fevered. You asked me to read to you and fell asleep mid-sentence, your breathing ragged but trusting. I sat there holding the book, afraid to move, afraid to disturb this impossible gift of your unconscious faith in my presence. That's when I understood: love isn't the big moments. It's me googling \"how to make fever go down\" at 2 AM. It's the twenty-seven tissues I counted in the trash. It's how beautiful you looked dying of the flu, which is an insane thought I'm putting in a proposal letter because you wanted truth.\n\nTruth: I've been taking secret photos of your hands. Not in a creepy way. Just\u2014your hands doing things. Holding coffee. Turning pages. That unconscious gesture where you touch your neck when you're thinking. I have 1,847 photos. They're saved in a folder called \"Tax Documents\" because I'm a coward and a fraud but at least I'm your coward, your fraud, if you'll have me.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologized last week for \"being a lot.\" But Leyi, you're not a lot\u2014you're everything. You're the first person I want to tell when anything happens. You're my favorite notification. You're the reason I believe in reincarnation, because one lifetime of you isn't enough data to understand the algorithm of how you make me feel.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: sometimes I watch you exist\u2014brushing your teeth, arguing with podcast hosts who can't hear you, the way you eat raspberries one tiny segment at a time like you're defusing a bomb\u2014and I get this pain in my chest. Not heartbreak. Heart-expansion. Like my ribs are trying to grow a bigger cage for all this feeling.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I'm just a man who can't fold fitted sheets, who still uses the same password for everything, who loves you with the graceless intensity of someone who never expected to be chosen. But here's the thing\u2014I'd rather fail at deserving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nI used to think I was saving up for something. Turns out I was saving up for you. For rings, yes, but also for Saturday mornings where we do nothing productive. For the specific way you'll sigh when I make the same joke for the fiftieth time. For the fights we'll have about whether AI will destroy humanity (you say yes, I say only if we're lucky). For the chance to be the person who knows you're afraid of the dark but more afraid of admitting it.\n\nThis letter is too long. You're probably rolling your eyes. But I need you to know: you haven't made me better. You've made me more myself. The self that was always there, waiting for someone who'd look at my collection of orphaned charging cables and still choose to love me.\n\nSo here it is, without metaphor: Will you marry me? Will you let me love you with receipts and evidence and the kind of dedication usually reserved for people who build ships in bottles? Will you be my wife, my witness, my favorite reason to check my phone?\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons and Thursday nights and all the unremarkable moments that add up to a life. I'm promising to try, fail, try again, and keep the receipts from every attempt.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the molecular structure of my existence. I'm just hoping we can make it legal.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm writing this while you're asleep next to me. You're snoring. It's perfect. You're perfect. This postscript is perfect.
