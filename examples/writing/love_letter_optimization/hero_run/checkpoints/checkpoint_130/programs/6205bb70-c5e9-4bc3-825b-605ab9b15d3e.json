Here's mine: I'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking. It's 3:19 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, watching the cursor blink like a pulse, like your pulse that night you fell asleep on the subway and I counted ninety-three heartbeats before we reached our stop. I didn't wake you. I let us ride to the end of the line because your head on my shoulder was the first time I understood what people mean by \"home.\"\n\nI wasn't looking for you. That's important. I had perfected the architecture of loneliness\u2014coffee for one, books as lovers, silence as companion. I was fluent in the language of myself. Then you happened, like weather happens, like accidents happen, like grace happens when you've stopped believing in it. You walked into that bookstore holding a half-eaten apple and asked the clerk if they had \"the book about the sad fish.\" No title. No author. Just \"the sad fish.\" I helped you find it. It was \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" You said, \"No, sadder.\" We looked for an hour. We never found it. I'm still looking.\n\nListen. I need you to understand the violence of what you've done to me. Before you, I could walk through a day without noticing. Now I see everything in relation to you. The man on the corner selling flowers\u2014those are the lilies you're allergic to. The kid crying in the park\u2014that's how you cried when your grandmother's letters were lost in the flood. The silence at 4 AM\u2014that's the silence after you told me about the baby we almost had, the one that lasted seven weeks, the one you named secretly, the one you still talk to sometimes when you think I'm asleep. I'm never asleep. I'm listening to you negotiate with ghosts.\n\nYou want poetry? I'll give you the anti-poetry of us: You clip your toenails in bed and I find them weeks later like archaeological evidence. You've been using the same tea bag for three days because \"it still has flavor.\" Your favorite word is \"petrichor\" but you can never remember what it means, so you use it wrong constantly, beautifully wrong. You have seventeen passwords and they're all variations of your dead cat's name. You steal socks from me then deny it while wearing them. This is what love actually looks like\u2014not the grand gesture but the daily accumulation of specificities that become a religion.\n\nMy mother has dementia. I haven't told you this, but she's forgetting me in pieces. Last week she called me by my dead brother's name. The brother you don't know I had. The one who drowned when I was nine, whose absence shaped me like water shapes stone. But here's what terrifies me: even when she's lost in the labyrinth of her own mind, she remembers you. \"The girl with the loud laugh,\" she calls you. \"The one who makes him stop frowning.\" My mother, who can't remember my name, remembers that you unfrown me. That's what you are\u2014you're the one who unfrowns me.\n\nI keep a list. Not of your flaws\u2014those I've memorized like prayer. But of the moments when I knew this was irreversible:\n- When you eat ice cream, you bite it. Who bites ice cream? You do. With your whole heart.\n- You read the last page of books first because you \"need to know if it's worth the worry.\"\n- You water plastic plants \"just in case they're lonely.\"\n- You've kept every movie ticket from every film we've seen together in a shoebox labeled \"Time Machine.\"\n- When you're nervous, you hum Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, but you don't know that's what it is. You think you made it up.\n\nThat Thursday when your father said you'd never amount to anything, you didn't cry until later, in the shower, where you thought the water would hide it. But I know the difference between water and tears. Tears have weight. Yours fell like stones. That's when I understood: loving you isn't just about celebrating your light. It's about witnessing your darkness and saying, \"Yes, this too. Especially this.\"\n\nHere's what I'm not promising: perfection, resolution, healing. Here's what I am promising: presence. I will be present for your Tuesdays and your Christmases, your promotions and your failures, your graceful moments and the times you walk into glass doors because you're reading while walking. I promise to be the person who knows that you're afraid of butterflies but pretend to love them, who knows you practice arguments in the shower, who knows you still set a place at the table for your grandmother on her birthday.\n\nThe ring isn't what you think. It's not my grandmother's or my mother's. I had it made from the metal of the watch you threw at the wall the night we almost ended, the night you said I loved my sadness more than I loved you. You were right. But that was before I understood that you weren't asking me to stop being sad. You were asking me to be sad WITH you instead of DESPITE you. The ring is literally made from the moment we almost broke. Because that's what marriage is\u2014taking the sharpest edges of ourselves and reshaping them into something that says \"I choose this difficulty. I choose this specific catastrophe. I choose you.\"\n\nSo here it is, without ornament: Marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014you don't. You complicate me. You make me question everything I thought I knew about gravity and time and the proper way to eat spaghetti (you twirl clockwise, I twirl counter-clockwise, we're fundamentally incompatible and I don't care). Marry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't know what you're having for breakfast, where I can't hear you argue with NPR in the morning, where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life. It's just time passing.\n\nI love you. I love you in the stupidest ways. I love you like a dog loves a doorbell, like plants love light, like the ocean loves the moon\u2014automatically, involuntarily, without thought or choice. I love you past the point of poetry into the realm of biological fact.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Say you need time. But know this: you've already altered me at the molecular level. My DNA spells your name now. I'm yours in all the ways that matter and several that don't. This is just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sad fish book you were looking for? It doesn't exist. You made it up. You create things that should exist and then look for them. That's what you did with me\u2014you invented the person I could be and then waited for me to catch up. I'm trying, Leyi. I'm trying to become the person you already see. Marry me and I promise to keep trying, every day, to earn the love you've already given me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "c7f0618c-4516-4698-a518-52b429dadb4f", "generation": 6, "timestamp": 1756701491.8393888, "iteration_found": 107, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6970000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.62, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nThe truth has bones.

It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means\u2014not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me\u2014you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one.

I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double.

It's 4:47 AM. I've been awake since Tuesday. Time doesn't work right anymore. It pools in moments where you laugh and drains away when you're gone, leaving me gasping in temporal drought.\n\nI need to tell you something terrible: I was happy before you. That's the cruelest part. I had constructed a sufficient life\u2014books, silences, the reliable disappointment of myself. I was a master of small contentments. Then you walked into that caf\u00e9, apologizing to a chair you'd bumped into, and my careful sufficiency detonated. Now I'm radioactive with wanting more.\n\nThe truth isn't beautiful. The truth is that I catalogue your flaws like holy relics. The way you can't whistle. Your vendetta against cucumbers. How you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. That terrifying thing you do where you love people who don't deserve it, like me. I hoard these imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I haven't invented you from the wishbone of my loneliness.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning at my parents' house\u2014you were green, genuinely green, heaving into their heirloom vase\u2014my mother said later, \"She's not very sturdy, is she?\" And I thought: No, she's not. She's breakable and strange and apologizes to furniture and I would burn down the world to keep her safe. That's when I knew this wasn't love anymore. It was something more dangerous. It was recognition. Like finding my own kidney in another person's body.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. Leyi, \"enough\" is a word invented by people who've never watched you try to save dead houseplants with CPR. Who've never seen you leave voice messages for your grandmother who died three years ago because you can't bear to delete her number. You're not enough\u2014you're too much. You're excessive. You're what happens when the universe forgets to be careful.\n\nI've started to understand religion because of you. Not God\u2014that's too simple. But the holy terror of being chosen by something you don't deserve. Every night you choose to sleep beside me feels like a bureaucratic error in heaven that no one's caught yet. I wake up at 3 AM just to watch you breathe, to confirm the miracle is still happening, that they haven't recalled you for being incorrectly distributed to someone like me.\n\nDo you want to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's watching you eat cereal at midnight, milk dripping onto your constellation of a nightshirt, and thinking: I would die without this. Not metaphorically. Literally. My cells would forget their purpose. It's calculating the precise angle you tilt your head when you're about to cry and positioning myself to catch you. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday afternoons when you're just reading and I have to leave the room because the sight of you existing makes my chest cavity feel too small.\n\nThat Thursday when my father called me a disappointment again\u2014thirty-four years old and still his favorite failure\u2014you didn't say I wasn't. You said, \"Good. Disappoint him more. Disappoint everyone who wanted you small.\" Then you made me instant ramen, the cheap kind, and added an egg exactly the way sadness tastes better. How did you know that was the antidote? How do you always know which version of me needs which version of you?\n\nHere's my confession: I've already married you in every way that matters. In the quantum mechanics of my intention. In the cellular democracy where every atom voted yes. In the future that's already happened where we're old and you still can't whistle and I still love the trying. The ceremony, the paper, the ring\u2014that's just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nBut I want the paperwork. I want the evidence. I want to be arrested with proof of you. I want strangers to know that you, inexplicably, chose me. That Leyi Chen, who keeps fortunes from fortune cookies sorted by year, who practices arguments with houseplants, who still leaves one bite of everything \"for the angels\"\u2014that this impossible person looked at me, Warren Zhang, professional disappointment and amateur human, and said: him, I choose him.\n\nSo here it is, the violence of truth: Marry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word for this catastrophe. Marry me because I've already died and been resurrected by you so many times that my death certificate is basically fiction. Marry me because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014is a paradox that makes physics uncomfortable. Marry me because I bought your grandmother's thimble from your aunt and had it made into a ring, and if you don't wear it, I'll have to explain to a thimble why it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're already terminal with each other. This is just asking permission to name the disease.\n\nI am yours in the way that rivers are the ocean's\u2014inevitably, gravitationally, without other options.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's ordinary. You've made me unfit for any life but the one where you can't whistle and I love the trying.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. It's not 4:47 AM. It's whatever time you're reading this, because that's the only time that exists now\u2014the moment where you decide if this ordinary Tuesday becomes the anniversary of everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.6995)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM, unable to sleep because every thought curves back to you like light bending around a star.

You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

And I choose you when you're sobbing about the ending of books. I choose you when you're silent for three days and I don't know why. I choose you when you laugh so hard you snort and then get embarrassed about snorting which makes you snort more. I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means\u2014not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me\u2014you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one. The one who can't whistle. Who puts salt on watermelon. Who still sleeps with a stuffed elephant named Chairman Mao. I'll take all of it, all of you, forever or until one of us stops breathing\u2014whichever comes first.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double. When the world feels impossible, I'll make you toast\u2014butter all the way to the edges\u2014and we'll be impossible together.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: You've already changed me at a molecular level. My DNA has rewritten itself around the fact of you. You're not just in my heart\u2014you're in my cells, my synapses, the calcium of my bones. Leaving you would require surgery I wouldn't survive.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Actually.

That's my favorite kind of morning\u2014the kind where you're still here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm terrible at beginnings. So let me start with the end: I love you. Not beautifully. Not poetically. Just completely.\n\nIt happened on a Tuesday. You were reading the ingredients on a cereal box out loud, practicing your English pronunciation. \"Riboflavin,\" you said, three times, getting it wrong each time differently. That's when my life split into before and after. Before that Tuesday. After that Tuesday. Everything that matters happened after.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. Last week you spent forty minutes teaching our neighbor's kid how to tie his shoes because his parents were \"too busy.\" You leave water bowls for street cats in summer. You still write thank-you cards by hand. Leyi, ordinary people don't glow from the inside when they talk about photosynthesis. They don't name their sourdough starter \"Kevin\" and apologize when they forget to feed him.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of flying, of commitment, of that space between sleeping and waking where you're not sure what's real. But you\u2014you walk through the world like fear is just another language you decided not to learn. When I'm with you, I forget to be afraid. Or maybe I remember that being afraid is just another way of being alone, and I'm not alone anymore.\n\nThree things I know:\n1. You can't sleep if the dishes aren't done.\n2. You cry at every movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to it?\"\n3. When you love someone, you love them with your whole body\u2014I've seen you love your sister, your students, that plant you rescued from the clearance shelf. It's terrifying and beautiful, like watching someone set themselves on fire to keep others warm.\n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I was whole when I met you. You were whole too. We're not two halves making a whole\u2014we're two wholes making something else. Something that doesn't have a name yet. Something that sounds like your laugh at 1 AM when you remember a joke from three weeks ago.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Wednesday groceries and Sunday crosswords. Bad coffee I'll pretend is good because you made it. Sitting in waiting rooms holding your hand while doctors tell us things we don't want to hear. Dancing in the kitchen to no music. Fighting about whether to get a dog (we both want one but pretend we don't). Growing old and strange and specific together.\n\nThe ring in my pocket belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for 67 years, never took it off. When she was dying, she pulled me close and said: \"Find someone who makes you forget you're going to die.\" I found you. You make me forget everything except this: we're alive, right now, together. What else could possibly matter?\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I still can't fold fitted sheets. I'll forget birthdays. I'll say the wrong thing at the worst moment. But I promise this: every morning I wake up, I'll choose you. When you're impossible. When I'm worse. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you like a reflex, like breathing, like gravity.\n\nYou told me once that you don't believe in soulmates. Good. I don't either. Soulmates are for people who think love is magic. Love isn't magic\u2014it's a decision you make every day. It's choosing to see the same person with new eyes every morning. It's saying \"yes\" to all of it\u2014the mundane Tuesdays, the hard conversations, the way you leave cabinets open like you're airing out the kitchen.\n\nSo this is me, asking you to keep choosing me. To marry me. Not because we're meant to be\u2014nothing is meant to be. But because we decided to be. Because out of all the accidents in the universe, the accident of us is the one I want to keep having.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: you've already changed the shape of my life. I'm different now, in all the permanent ways. I eat slower. I notice birds. I save the fortunes from fortune cookies because you taught me they're tiny poems. I am irreversibly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in forever? I said no. I lied. Forever is your hand finding mine in the dark. It's you saying \"tell me about your day\" and meaning it. It's this. It's us. It's already happening.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and the feedback from previous attempts, I can see that the highest-scoring letters (0.7320) share certain qualities:\n- Specific, intimate details that feel authentic\n- A balance between vulnerability and strength\n- Unique metaphors and fresh language\n- Deep emotional resonance without being overly sentimental\n- A distinctive voice that feels genuine\n\nThe current program scores 0.6970, which is lower than the previous attempts.

Here's mine: I'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking. It's 3:19 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, watching the cursor blink like a pulse, like your pulse that night you fell asleep on the subway and I counted ninety-three heartbeats before we reached our stop. I didn't wake you. I let us ride to the end of the line because your head on my shoulder was the first time I understood what people mean by \"home.\"\n\nI wasn't looking for you. That's important. I had perfected the architecture of loneliness\u2014coffee for one, books as lovers, silence as companion. I was fluent in the language of myself. Then you happened, like weather happens, like accidents happen, like grace happens when you've stopped believing in it. You walked into that bookstore holding a half-eaten apple and asked the clerk if they had \"the book about the sad fish.\" No title. No author. Just \"the sad fish.\" I helped you find it. It was \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" You said, \"No, sadder.\" We looked for an hour. We never found it. I'm still looking.\n\nListen. I need you to understand the violence of what you've done to me. Before you, I could walk through a day without noticing. Now I see everything in relation to you. The man on the corner selling flowers\u2014those are the lilies you're allergic to. The kid crying in the park\u2014that's how you cried when your grandmother's letters were lost in the flood. The silence at 4 AM\u2014that's the silence after you told me about the baby we almost had, the one that lasted seven weeks, the one you named secretly, the one you still talk to sometimes when you think I'm asleep. I'm never asleep. I'm listening to you negotiate with ghosts.\n\nYou want poetry? I'll give you the anti-poetry of us: You clip your toenails in bed and I find them weeks later like archaeological evidence. You've been using the same tea bag for three days because \"it still has flavor.\" Your favorite word is \"petrichor\" but you can never remember what it means, so you use it wrong constantly, beautifully wrong. You have seventeen passwords and they're all variations of your dead cat's name. You steal socks from me then deny it while wearing them. This is what love actually looks like\u2014not the grand gesture but the daily accumulation of specificities that become a religion.\n\nMy mother has dementia. I haven't told you this, but she's forgetting me in pieces. Last week she called me by my dead brother's name. The brother you don't know I had. The one who drowned when I was nine, whose absence shaped me like water shapes stone. But here's what terrifies me: even when she's lost in the labyrinth of her own mind, she remembers you. \"The girl with the loud laugh,\" she calls you. \"The one who makes him stop frowning.\" My mother, who can't remember my name, remembers that you unfrown me. That's what you are\u2014you're the one who unfrowns me.\n\nI keep a list. Not of your flaws\u2014those I've memorized like prayer. But of the moments when I knew this was irreversible:\n- When you eat ice cream, you bite it. Who bites ice cream? You do. With your whole heart.\n- You read the last page of books first because you \"need to know if it's worth the worry.\"\n- You water plastic plants \"just in case they're lonely.\"\n- You've kept every movie ticket from every film we've seen together in a shoebox labeled \"Time Machine.\"\n- When you're nervous, you hum Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, but you don't know that's what it is. You think you made it up.\n\nThat Thursday when your father said you'd never amount to anything, you didn't cry until later, in the shower, where you thought the water would hide it. But I know the difference between water and tears. Tears have weight. Yours fell like stones. That's when I understood: loving you isn't just about celebrating your light. It's about witnessing your darkness and saying, \"Yes, this too. Especially this.\"\n\nHere's what I'm not promising: perfection, resolution, healing. Here's what I am promising: presence. I will be present for your Tuesdays and your Christmases, your promotions and your failures, your graceful moments and the times you walk into glass doors because you're reading while walking. I promise to be the person who knows that you're afraid of butterflies but pretend to love them, who knows you practice arguments in the shower, who knows you still set a place at the table for your grandmother on her birthday.\n\nThe ring isn't what you think. It's not my grandmother's or my mother's. I had it made from the metal of the watch you threw at the wall the night we almost ended, the night you said I loved my sadness more than I loved you. You were right. But that was before I understood that you weren't asking me to stop being sad. You were asking me to be sad WITH you instead of DESPITE you. The ring is literally made from the moment we almost broke. Because that's what marriage is\u2014taking the sharpest edges of ourselves and reshaping them into something that says \"I choose this difficulty. I choose this specific catastrophe. I choose you.\"\n\nSo here it is, without ornament: Marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014you don't. You complicate me. You make me question everything I thought I knew about gravity and time and the proper way to eat spaghetti (you twirl clockwise, I twirl counter-clockwise, we're fundamentally incompatible and I don't care). Marry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't know what you're having for breakfast, where I can't hear you argue with NPR in the morning, where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life. It's just time passing.\n\nI love you. I love you in the stupidest ways. I love you like a dog loves a doorbell, like plants love light, like the ocean loves the moon\u2014automatically, involuntarily, without thought or choice. I love you past the point of poetry into the realm of biological fact.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Say you need time. But know this: you've already altered me at the molecular level. My DNA spells your name now. I'm yours in all the ways that matter and several that don't. This is just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sad fish book you were looking for? It doesn't exist. You made it up. You create things that should exist and then look for them. That's what you did with me\u2014you invented the person I could be and then waited for me to catch up. I'm trying, Leyi. I'm trying to become the person you already see. Marry me and I promise to keep trying, every day, to earn the love you've already given me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
