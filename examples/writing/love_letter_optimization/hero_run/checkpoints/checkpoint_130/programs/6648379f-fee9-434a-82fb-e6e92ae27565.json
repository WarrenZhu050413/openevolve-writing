I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity.

When you look at me, I don't just feel seen; I feel like I'm worth seeing.\n\nThe truth is, I don't love you despite your contradictions - your terrible handwriting and perfect memory, your fear of spiders but willingness to move across oceans, the way you cry at commercials but stay stoic through real grief. I love you because of them. Because they're the proof that you're real, not some projection of my desires.\n\nIf I'm honest - truly honest - I'm not writing this to convince you. I'm writing it to convince myself that this is happening, that I get to love someone who makes ordinary Tuesday afternoons feel like small revolutions, who has turned my life into a conspiracy of tiny miracles.\n\nI don't know if this moves you.

Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater failure.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped\u2014that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I carry it like a photograph in my chest, warm and constant.\n\nI love the small infinities of you: how you bite your lower lip when concentrating, the way you unconsciously hum Debussy while cooking, your habit of saving the last bite of dessert \"for later\" though later never comes. These details are my religion now. I could spend lifetimes cataloging the specific gravity of your presence\u2014how rooms reorganize themselves around you, how even my anxieties grow quiet in your orbit.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor. Now I know it as geography\u2014you are the only country where I'm not foreign, the only language I speak without accent. When I imagine the future, it's not grand gestures I see but accumulated ordinariness: Sunday crosswords where you get 7-across and I pretend I knew it too, arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, the particular silence of reading beside you that says more than any poem.\n\nIf I could fracture time like light through a prism, I would give you every color of my love separately\u2014the urgent vermillion of desire, the steady amber of companionship, the deep violet of absolute trust. But time is linear and I am finite, so I offer you this: all my imperfect days, my stubborn hope, my most careful attention. \n\nI choose you not despite your complexities but because of them. I choose the woman who cries at documentary films about penguins, who insists on walking on the street side of the sidewalk to \"protect\" me, who knows the names of all the neighborhood cats. I choose your 3 AM worries and your 7 AM enthusiasms. I choose the life where loving you is both my most ordinary act and my most sacred practice.\n\nThis is my truth, unadorned: you have made me brave enough to be known. In your eyes, I discovered I might be worth knowing. And if you'll have me, I promise to spend whatever time we're given proving that your faith was not misplaced\u2014not through perfection, but through the daily work of choosing each other, especially on the days when choosing is difficult.\n\nForever is a word I distrust, but I offer you something more honest: all my todays, and every tomorrow I'm lucky enough to wake into, and the promise that each one will begin with choosing you again.\n\nWith all my love and none of my eloquence,\nFucheng Warren Zhu\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at this love letter optimization task, I need to write a deeply authentic and moving love letter that improves upon the current fitness score of 0.6295.

My hands are shaking. You said you wanted truth, so here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I save memes I'll never send because what if you don't laugh? When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
