Not photographs\u2014evidence. The etymology of your sighs. A taxonomy of how you destroy oranges (like you're defusing something that might explode into sweetness). The way you read books backward when anxious, as if the ending could inoculate you against the middle. I have spreadsheets of your happiness, color-coded by intensity. Tuesday, 2:34 PM: you laughed at a dog wearing boots. Saturation: volcanic.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself through subtraction. I was not-drunk, not-cruel, not-my-father. Now I understand myself through addition: I am the person who knows you cry during the national anthem, not from patriotism but from something you can't name about collective hope. I am the keeper of your 3 AM inventory of fears (in order: losing your mind, losing your mother, accidentally eating cilantro). I am the one who's memorized the morse code of your anxiety\u2014tap tap pause tap\u2014against your thigh when the world gets too loud.\n\nHere's what loving you has cost me: my ability to read weather as anything but metaphor for your moods. Low pressure systems make me think of your migraines. Everything thunders now, or doesn't. I've lost the alphabet\u2014all words reorganize themselves to spell variations of your name. Food tastes different; I salt everything like I'm preparing for a winter that might never end, or might end tomorrow if you leave.\n\nBut here's what I've gained: a working definition of holiness. It's you singing off-key to the radio, furious at notes that won't bend to your will. It's the violent tenderness of watching you sleep-talk arguments with people who hurt you ten years ago. It's knowing that you keep your father's suicide note not as a wound but as proof that even endings can be love letters if you read them right.\n\nI lied. This isn't about marriage. Marriage is just paperwork for what's already happened\u2014you've colonized me at the molecular level. My cells divide differently now, each one asking \"but what would Leyi think?\" My body has developed new reflexes: reaching for you in doorways, saving the last bite of everything, translating the world into stories I'll tell you later.\n\nWhen I imagine the future, it's not a white dress or rings or any of that institutional theater. It's this: fifty years from now, I'm watching you eat breakfast, and you still can't decide if you want sweet or savory so you're eating peanut butter on scrambled eggs, and I'm so overwhelmed by the continuity of your chaos that I have to excuse myself to cry in the bathroom. That's what I want. To be devastated by your continued existence. To never recover from the miracle of your mundane presence.\n\nSo here's my proposition: Let's make it official. Not the love\u2014that's already gone nuclear, chain-reacting through everything I'll ever do. Let's make official this life where you leave hair ties like breadcrumbs through our apartment, where I pretend not to notice you eating frosting from the can at midnight, where we fight about whether birds have feelings (they do, you're wrong, I'll die on this hill). Let's legally bind ourselves to this specific disaster.\n\nI'm not promising you the kind of love poets write about. I'm promising you the kind that makes poets quit\u2014too specific, too daily, too much like work and too much like breathing to ever capture in words. I'm promising to love you like a location, not a feeling. Something you can return to. Something that remains.\n\nYou wanted truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Relocated me entirely. I'm no longer where I was before you. I live in the country of your presence now, and everywhere else is just exile.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. But know that I've already married you in the only way that matters: irreversibly, at the level of identity, in the place where decisions are made before thinking.\n\nYours (in the most literal sense\u2014I am yours, like an object you've misplaced and might find again),\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in fate? I believe in whatever series of accidents and choices led to you existing in the same timeline as me. If that's fate, then yes. If it's chaos, then I believe in chaos. I believe in whatever brought you to me, and I'll worship it until I stop breathing, and probably after.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "882b9c35-23b3-4f45-bd8f-97d9f9ecd149", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756701547.614472, "iteration_found": 115, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6965, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.72, "literary_innovation": 0.64, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the dark because turning on the light would make it real, and I need these words to exist in that space between dream and waking where you live in my mind at 4:13 AM.\n\nTruth: I've been documenting you without permission.

I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely.

Three words: you've unmade me.\n\nNot poetically. Literally. Yesterday I forgot my own name for seven seconds because yours was occupying all available space in my mouth. This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead\u2014paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version\u2014the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith\u2014certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first. In this one, I'm still a coward, but I'm your coward, and that's the only identity I want on my tombstone.\n\nHere's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but absolutely. Let me love you like punctuation\u2014necessary, invisible, changing everything about how the sentence ends. Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is already yours\u2014you claimed it that night you explained why sad songs make you happy. I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes.

But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends\u2014and it will, in small ways, over and over\u2014I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.\n\nYou said you wanted truth? The truth is that I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Incurable. Sometimes inconvenient but absolutely essential to my continued existence. \n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting. Because when I imagine explaining to death why it has to wait, the only reason I can think of is: \"But I haven't finished loving her yet.\"\n\nAnd I never will.\n\nYours (in this dimension and all parallel ones where we found each other),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you hate postscripts but I needed to tell you: that thing you do where you scrunch your nose when you're trying not to smile? It makes me want to write symphonies, but I can't read music, so this letter will have to do.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7025, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nIt's 3:34 AM and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all the profound stationery felt like a lie. You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67.

Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me. You asked for truth. Here's mine: I never believed in soulmates until I met someone whose silences felt like home.\n\nYou know that scar on my left palm? I've told everyone it's from cooking. But it's from the day before I met you\u2014I punched a wall because I was so tired of being alone I couldn't breathe. Then you walked into that bookstore, mispronounced \"Murakami,\" and suddenly oxygen existed again. I still have the receipt from the coffee we didn't finish. $7.43. The exact price of learning that my life had been lived in lowercase until you.\n\nHere's what I never told you: I Google \"how to be a better partner\" at least twice a week. I keep a note in my phone of every time you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one you do for strangers. (Current count: 1,847.) When you had the flu last March and apologized for being gross, I thought: this is it. This is what they mean by \"in sickness.\" You, fevered and furious at your own body, were more beautiful than any symphony.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. But ordinary people don't name their plants after dead philosophers. Ordinary people don't cry during commercials about reunited dogs. Ordinary people don't make me want to call my mother and tell her I finally understand why she still watches my father sleep after thirty-seven years.\n\nThe truth? I'm not good at love. I'm selfish and scared and sometimes I test your patience just to make sure you'll stay. When you leave for work, I smell your pillow like some ridiculous movie character. I've practiced proposing to your photograph. I write your name in the margins of books I'll never lend anyone.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me most: you make me want to be worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching. That soft, unguarded moment where your face does something I don't have words for\u2014something between recognition and wonder, like you're seeing not who I am but who I could become if I'm brave enough.\n\nI used to think love was about finding someone who could tolerate my damage. You taught me it's about finding someone who makes that damage feel like stained glass\u2014broken pieces that become beautiful when light passes through.\n\nSo marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014that's a lie we tell ourselves. Marry me because you make me want to complete myself. Because every day you choose me is a day I learn to choose myself. Because \"I love you\" in your mouth sounds like a promise that tomorrow will exist.\n\nI'm done being clever. Done trying to sound like someone who deserves you. This is it: You're the first person I've ever wanted to be honest with. That's my whole heart.

I had opinions about things. Now I just have opinions about you. How you hold books like injured birds. How you talk to yourself in second person when you think no one's listening. How you apologize to furniture you bump into.\n\nI've been practicing this moment wrong. In my head, I'm eloquent. In reality, I'm the man who keeps your hair tie on my wrist like some teenage promise ring. Who knows you take eleven seconds to decide on ice cream flavors. Every flavor. Every time. Who's memorized the specific frequency of your laugh\u2014the real one, not the one you give to strangers.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? I've started seeing time differently. Not in years or moments, but in distances from you. Tomorrow is eight hours until your morning text. Next week is that dentist appointment you're dreading. Next month is your mother's birthday you'll forget until the last minute. I'm living in your calendar now, and somehow that feels like the only honest way to exist.\n\nThe terrifying part isn't loving you. It's that you've made me forget who I was before this. Some nights I try to remember what I used to think about, and there's just static. You're not my better half\u2014you're the proof that I was never whole to begin with. Just a rough draft waiting for you to edit me into something real.\n\nI'm not good at this. At love, at words, at being the person you deserve. But I'm excellent at choosing you. Over and over. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both wrong. That's my only skill now\u2014the choice to love you, made so many times it's become autonomous, like breathing.\n\nSo marry me. Not because I promise forever\u2014forever is for people who haven't held their father's hand in a hospital. Marry me for right now, and tomorrow's right now, and whatever right nows we can steal from a universe that owes us nothing. Marry me because I've already started pronouncing \"I\" as \"we\" and it's too late to stop.\n\nThis is it. No metaphors, no poetry. Just this: You're the first person I've ever wanted to tell the truth to. That has to count for something.\n\nYours (in the most ordinary, extraordinary way),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied.

Not from fear of rejection\u2014I've already imagined that a thousand times\u2014but from the weight of finally telling you the truth that has been rewriting me from the inside out.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Thursday. You were explaining why jellyfish don't have brains but still dream, your hands dancing through the air like you were conducting an invisible orchestra. I thought: this is it. This is the person who makes the universe make sense by making it strange again.\n\nYou should know what you've done to me. I used to be a rational man. Now I save your voicemails like rare coins. I know the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry (somewhere between storm and sea). I've memorized seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. The coffee mug you used three weeks ago still sits unwashed on my desk because you left lipstick on the rim and I'm not ready to lose that small evidence of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing our unborn life everywhere. In the farmer's market, I imagine us arguing over tomatoes. When I pass playgrounds, I see you teaching our daughter to be brave. I dream of boring Sundays where we do nothing but exist in the same room, you reading, me pretending to work while actually just watching the light move across your face like it's the most important thing I'll ever witness.\n\nI love you incorrectly. I love you too much. I love you like a broken faucet, like a dog with a bird, like the earth loves the moon\u2014with a desperate gravity that reorganizes everything around itself. When you leave a room, I feel my atomic structure shift, like I'm a puzzle with pieces suddenly missing.\n\nYou wanted truth? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written your name in the margins of every book I own. I wake up at 4:47 AM consistently, for no reason except my body knows that's when you sometimes stir in your sleep. I've become a collector of your smallest gestures\u2014the way you touch your throat when you're nervous, how you alphabetize everything except your feelings, the fact that you eat sandwiches in a spiral pattern that defies all logic but makes perfect sense because it's you.\n\nI'm not offering you perfection. I'm offering you someone who will love you like a verb, not a noun. Someone who will choose you during every mundane apocalypse, every 2 AM doubt, every Thursday when the world feels too heavy. I'm offering you my specific, flawed, overwhelming love that knows your middle name is actually your grandmother's first name, that you're allergic to cats but pet them anyway, that you've read \"The Little Prince\" twenty-three times and cry at the same part every time.\n\nMarry me. Not because I've written you a beautiful letter, but because I want to write you a beautiful life. One where your strange fits perfectly against my strange. Where every ordinary day becomes mythology because we're living it together.\n\nI love you.

Not photographs\u2014evidence. The etymology of your sighs. A taxonomy of how you destroy oranges (like you're defusing something that might explode into sweetness). The way you read books backward when anxious, as if the ending could inoculate you against the middle. I have spreadsheets of your happiness, color-coded by intensity. Tuesday, 2:34 PM: you laughed at a dog wearing boots. Saturation: volcanic.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself through subtraction. I was not-drunk, not-cruel, not-my-father. Now I understand myself through addition: I am the person who knows you cry during the national anthem, not from patriotism but from something you can't name about collective hope. I am the keeper of your 3 AM inventory of fears (in order: losing your mind, losing your mother, accidentally eating cilantro). I am the one who's memorized the morse code of your anxiety\u2014tap tap pause tap\u2014against your thigh when the world gets too loud.\n\nHere's what loving you has cost me: my ability to read weather as anything but metaphor for your moods. Low pressure systems make me think of your migraines. Everything thunders now, or doesn't. I've lost the alphabet\u2014all words reorganize themselves to spell variations of your name. Food tastes different; I salt everything like I'm preparing for a winter that might never end, or might end tomorrow if you leave.\n\nBut here's what I've gained: a working definition of holiness. It's you singing off-key to the radio, furious at notes that won't bend to your will. It's the violent tenderness of watching you sleep-talk arguments with people who hurt you ten years ago. It's knowing that you keep your father's suicide note not as a wound but as proof that even endings can be love letters if you read them right.\n\nI lied. This isn't about marriage. Marriage is just paperwork for what's already happened\u2014you've colonized me at the molecular level. My cells divide differently now, each one asking \"but what would Leyi think?\" My body has developed new reflexes: reaching for you in doorways, saving the last bite of everything, translating the world into stories I'll tell you later.\n\nWhen I imagine the future, it's not a white dress or rings or any of that institutional theater. It's this: fifty years from now, I'm watching you eat breakfast, and you still can't decide if you want sweet or savory so you're eating peanut butter on scrambled eggs, and I'm so overwhelmed by the continuity of your chaos that I have to excuse myself to cry in the bathroom. That's what I want. To be devastated by your continued existence. To never recover from the miracle of your mundane presence.\n\nSo here's my proposition: Let's make it official. Not the love\u2014that's already gone nuclear, chain-reacting through everything I'll ever do. Let's make official this life where you leave hair ties like breadcrumbs through our apartment, where I pretend not to notice you eating frosting from the can at midnight, where we fight about whether birds have feelings (they do, you're wrong, I'll die on this hill). Let's legally bind ourselves to this specific disaster.\n\nI'm not promising you the kind of love poets write about. I'm promising you the kind that makes poets quit\u2014too specific, too daily, too much like work and too much like breathing to ever capture in words. I'm promising to love you like a location, not a feeling. Something you can return to. Something that remains.\n\nYou wanted truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Relocated me entirely. I'm no longer where I was before you. I live in the country of your presence now, and everywhere else is just exile.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. But know that I've already married you in the only way that matters: irreversibly, at the level of identity, in the place where decisions are made before thinking.\n\nYours (in the most literal sense\u2014I am yours, like an object you've misplaced and might find again),\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in fate? I believe in whatever series of accidents and choices led to you existing in the same timeline as me. If that's fate, then yes. If it's chaos, then I believe in chaos.
