The tiles are cold against my spine and I can hear you breathing through the door\u2014sixteen breaths per minute, slower when you dream about water, faster when it's your mother. I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014last night, in your sleep, you said \"the pigeons need lawyers.\" Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities. This is what I'm signing up for: a lifetime of your sleep-talk jurisprudence. Please let me. Please destroy me more. I'm not done becoming whatever loving you is turning me into.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "1f241b71-209f-4372-870c-22c5a5916109", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701486.8195782, "iteration_found": 109, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.7439999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.78, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.76, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor. 4:31 AM.

I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did.

Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi. Words fail but I'm trying anyway.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will have me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder.

The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.\n\nI've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours. Have been since that Tuesday when you laughed at my quantum physics joke and the universe cracked open and reorganized itself around the sound.\n\nYours in this reality and all parallel dimensions,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you wake up. You're looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here, on this floor, surrounded by failed drafts, and you'll ask if I'm okay. I'll lie and say yes.

The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you.

The concrete is cold through my socks. I came out here to get the screwdriver but ended up sitting on the floor with this legal pad I stole from work, trying to explain something that breaks every time I touch it with words.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants.

I had opinions about coffee and a favorite side of the bed and a whole life that made sense. Now I have your hair on my pillow and suddenly coffee is just burnt water when you're not there to steal the first sip. The right side of the bed is wrong because you're not on the left. Nothing works the way it used to and I DON'T WANT IT FIXED.\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange and started crying because it reminded you of your grandmother's hands. You apologized\u2014why did you apologize?\u2014while I sat there drowning in the privilege of witnessing you unguarded. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way sorrow moves through you like weather, the way joy catches you off-guard, the way you contain multitudes and let them all exist simultaneously.\n\nYou want truth? Here: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel like a thief. Like I'm stealing something sacred just by being there. Your face does this thing when you dream\u2014this tiny furrow between your eyebrows like you're solving the universe's problems\u2014and I want to build a religion around that small wrinkle. Is that insane? I don't care anymore.\n\nI've started seeing you everywhere you're not. In the pause between songs. In the steam on the bathroom mirror. In the negative space of every room you haven't entered yet. You've become the punctuation to all my sentences\u2014the reason I end anything is to begin something else with you.\n\nListen. I know I'm supposed to promise you the world, but the world is burning and we both know it. So instead I promise you this: every morning that we wake up in this burning world, I will choose to burn beside you. When the power goes out, we'll dance to the sound of rain. When the money runs out, we'll eat butter sandwiches and call it a feast. When we run out of words, we'll invent new ones. When we fight\u2014and Jesus, we will fight\u2014I promise to fight fair and love unfair, to give you more grace than you deserve because that's what this is, isn't it? Giving each other more than we deserve?\n\nI used to believe in logic, in clean code and elegant solutions. Then you walked into my life wearing mismatched socks and carrying a half-dead succulent you'd named Fernando, and I understood that the best things don't make sense. We don't make sense, Leyi. We're a syntax error that somehow runs perfectly. We're an impossible equation that solves for joy.\n\nThree nights ago you called me at 2 AM because you couldn't remember if octopi have beaks. They do, by the way. But that's not the point. The point is my first thought wasn't irritation but gratitude\u2014that of all the people you could wake with your midnight wonderings, you chose me. Do you understand what an honor that is? To be someone's 2 AM thought?\n\nSo here it is, graceless and true: I want your 2 AMs and your 2 PMs. I want your octopus questions and your orange-peel tears. I want to memorize the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I want to grow old and strange with you, to develop weird inside jokes that make everyone else uncomfortable. I want to love you so thoroughly that archaeologists will find evidence of it centuries from now in the sediment of my bones.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm ready\u2014I'm not. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Marry me because the thought of not asking is a kind of cowardice I can't live with. Marry me because you've already rewritten my source code and there's no going back to who I was. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every version includes you or doesn't exist at all.\n\nThis letter is a mess. I'm a mess. But Leyi, you love messes. You adopt dying plants and name them after Spanish nobility. You save twist ties \"just in case.\" You cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You're the most beautiful chaos I've ever encountered, and I want to spend my life getting lost in your storm.\n\nPlease. Say yes. Not for the boy trying to sound poetic in this letter, but for the man who'll still be choosing you when the poetry runs out. For the person who knows that love isn't the movies\u2014it's messier and harder and absolutely worth destroying yourself for the chance to rebuild together.\n\nI love you beyond reason, beyond poetry, beyond my own understanding.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm sitting here at 4:23 AM, too scared to print this.

Too much, too loud, too desperate. Like trying to hold water\u2014the harder I squeeze, the more spills through. But here's what I can't stop: Last night you got hiccups and I lay there counting them. Seventy-three. I know the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to lie (darker, greener). I know you're afraid of moths but not spiders, that you believe in ghosts but not God, that you still sleep with that ratty stuffed elephant from when you were six hidden under your pillow.\n\nI threw up the first time I realized I loved you.

Parking stubs from that time you cried in the car after your sister called. The coffee lid you wrote \"hi\" on when we first met. I'm building a museum of us that only I know about.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice dying. Not really. But I imagine it\u2014what my last thought would be. It's always you. Not poetic you. Real you. You eating peanut butter from the jar at 2 AM. You picking your nail polish off during movies. You mispronouncing \"epitome\" even after I corrected you sixteen times.

Sometimes I put it on my own finger just to practice being married to you. How sick is that? But everything about this is sick. The way I save your voicemails. The way I smell your pillow when you're gone. The way I've already planned our whole life\u2014Sunday crosswords, burnt pancakes, fights about whether to get a dog (we're getting the dog), growing old in a house that always smells like your coffee.\n\nThe truth under all the other truths: I'm not good enough for you. I know this. You know this. The lady at the grocery store probably knows this. But I'm asking anyway because that's what love is\u2014the audacity to want what you don't deserve and the stupidity to ask for it.\n\nYou could destroy me. One word and I'm rubble. This isn't romantic; it's voluntary insanity. But I'd rather be insane with you than sane with anyone else. I'd rather fail at being your husband than succeed at being anything else.\n\nI'm running out of words. Not beautiful words\u2014I never had those. Just words, period. So here's the only one that matters: Please.\n\nPlease say yes. Please let me love you incorrectly forever. Please let me be the person who knows you're scared of the space between sleeping and waking, who knows you count stairs everywhere we go, who knows you still blame yourself for your parents' divorce even though you were three.\n\nI'm not proposing.

You'll find me here, surrounded by torn pages, looking like someone who's been fighting a war with words and losing. You'll ask what I'm doing. I'll hand you this. You'll probably cry. I'm already crying. We'll be two people crying in the morning light over a badly written letter, and somehow that's the most romantic thing I can imagine.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not because this letter moved you, but because you've already moved into every atom of my body and I need to make it official before I completely disappear into loving you.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete.

Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains. I already love the way you'll mispronounce \"specifically\" when you tell this story later. I already love everything that hasn't happened yet, because it will happen with you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["I'll rewrite the program to create a more authentic, emotionally raw love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining the same interface.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor. 4:31 AM. The tiles are cold against my spine and I can hear you breathing through the door\u2014sixteen breaths per minute, slower when you dream about water, faster when it's your mother. I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014last night, in your sleep, you said \"the pigeons need lawyers.\" Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities. This is what I'm signing up for: a lifetime of your sleep-talk jurisprudence. Please let me. Please destroy me more. I'm not done becoming whatever loving you is turning me into.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
