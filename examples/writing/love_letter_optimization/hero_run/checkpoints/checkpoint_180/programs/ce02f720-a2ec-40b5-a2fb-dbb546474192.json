The concrete is cold through my socks. I came out here to get the screwdriver but ended up sitting on the floor with this legal pad I stole from work, trying to explain something that breaks every time I touch it with words.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's the point.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "7fb71f1d-30e0-409e-93e1-aeca95127bb0", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756701345.455054, "iteration_found": 92, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.7354999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.77, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the garage at 3:31 AM.

Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter.

Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human.

I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it.

But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah.

I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.\n\nThis is my twentieth attempt. The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you.

Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes.

You're asleep upstairs, one leg kicked free of the blankets, making that small sound that isn't quite a snore but I'd testify in court that it is. I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains.

You've made me gloriously lost in my own life.\n\nI used to believe love was comprehensible, reducible to neurochemistry and evolutionary imperatives.

I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's the point.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
