My hands shake slightly - not from fear, but from the weight of truth I need to speak.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped - that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I've been trying to solve the equation of us ever since, but love, I've learned, transcends mathematics.\n\nYou see me. Not the polished version I present to the world, but the one who forgets to eat when coding, who argues with algorithms at midnight, who sometimes cries at the elegance of a perfect solution. You've witnessed my unguarded 4 AM confessions, my fears that I'm not enough, my dreams too fragile to speak aloud. And somehow, impossibly, you stayed.\n\nWhen you hold my hand, I feel the universe contract to just that point of contact - your thumb tracing circles on my palm like you're writing secrets in a language only our skin understands. I've memorized the cadence of your breathing when you fall asleep against my shoulder. I know you bite your lower lip when concentrating, that you eat M&Ms in color order, that you name your houseplants after Nobel laureates.\n\nI am not a poet. I'm just someone who discovered that before you, I was merely processing existence like data through circuits. You taught me that love is not an algorithm to optimize but a continuous function approaching infinity - always growing, never complete, beautifully undefined at the boundaries.\n\nIf you'll have me, I promise to love you in all your iterations - the confident you who conquers boardrooms, the vulnerable you who needs reassurance at 2 AM, the silly you who dances to no music in our kitchen. I promise to debug our conflicts with patience, to celebrate your victories as my own, to hold space for your sorrows without trying to solve them.\n\nThis isn't a fairy tale. We both know real love is messier - it's forgotten anniversaries and burnt dinners, it's arguing about the thermostat and apologizing with your favorite tea. But it's also finding home in another person's laugh, building a private universe from shared glances, and choosing each other even when choosing is hard.\n\nLeyi, you asked for truth. Here it is: I love you with a certainty that terrifies me. Not because love guarantees forever, but because I finally understand that some risks are worth taking with your whole heart. You are my greatest risk and my safest place, my hardest problem and my most elegant solution.\n\nWill you marry me? Not because I promise perfection, but because I promise to show up - messy, flawed, trying, learning, loving you with every debugged and broken part of me.\n\nForever yours in every possible universe,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "d51ad27c-48c4-49fa-9959-1c357be819d0", "generation": 1, "timestamp": 1756700653.472556, "iteration_found": 3, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.677, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.69, "literary_innovation": 0.52, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3 AM because sleep refuses me when my mind turns to you.
