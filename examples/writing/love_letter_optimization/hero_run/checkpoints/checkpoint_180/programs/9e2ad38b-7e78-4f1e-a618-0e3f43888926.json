Love letters are for people who believe in language. I'm writing you a medical report. Patient: Warren. Condition: terminal lucidity caused by proximity to one Leyi [LAST NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE].\n\n*\n\nClinical observation: Since meeting you, my resting heart rate has permanently decreased by 5 BPM except when you enter rooms (spike to 97). My sleep architecture has restructured\u2014REM cycles now synchronize to your breathing. This is medically impossible. I've had it tested. Three different doctors. One said \"love doesn't work that way.\" I said \"then medicine is broken.\"\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the accident that didn't happen. Highway 12, last Tuesday, 73 mph. Semi-truck jackknifed ahead. Time dilated\u2014full temporal distortion. My only thought: \"Not yet. She hasn't seen Kyoto in spring.\" Not my life flashing. Yours, unlived. The future I'd be stealing from you by dying badly. I yanked the wheel so hard I tore shoulder cartilage. You never noticed. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I've never corrected you. The wrong version is ours now.\n\n*\n\nHere's what haunts me: In quantum mechanics, observation changes outcomes. By watching you, I'm changing you. Every day you become more observed, more particular, less wave function, more collapsed into this specific reality where you chose me. What if I'm stealing your other possibilities? What if there's a universe where you're happier without my constant documentation?\n\nI don't care. I'm not that good. I'd steal infinite versions of you from infinite other universes just to keep this one.\n\n*\n\nData point: You have 47 different laughs. I have names for them:\n- The Surprise Crow (harsh caw when shocked)\n- The Bedroom Hyena (3 AM delirium)\n- The Polite Funeral (for bad jokes you love me through)\n- The Real One (uses your whole skeleton, rearranges local gravity)\n\nThe Real One happens 4.2% of the time. I live for that 4.2%.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Yesterday I calculated our deaths. Actuarial tables, family histories, lifestyle factors. 83% chance you die first. The number made me so angry I threw my laptop. Then I retrieved it to recalculate with better variables. Still 83%. I've started eating your vegetables when you're not looking, trying to steal death-risk from your plate to mine.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our stupidest moments. When you argue with Siri. When you cry at commercials featuring any animal. When you pretend you didn't eat my emergency chocolate (you have tells\u2014you touch your hair and look left). I love you at 6 AM and 11 PM and 2:33 PM when you don't know what you want for lunch so you eat cheese standing at the refrigerator like a beautiful criminal.\n\n*\n\nThe marriage thing: Look, we both know we're already married in twelve dimensions. Your hair elastics live on my wrist. I dream in your accent now. We share antibodies. But I want the legal document. The government witness. The stupid party where your aunt gets drunk and tells the story about your teenage nihilist phase. I want the whole catastrophe of formal union because I'm a greedy bastard who wants you in every possible way\u2014legally, spiritually, molecularly, grammatically.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something horrible? I've been practicing your eulogy. Different versions for different ages. Car crash at 34 (brief, shocked). Cancer at 67 (long, angry at God). Old age at 94 (grateful but destroyed). I write them to prepare. I write them to prevent. I write them because if I can imagine every ending maybe I can trick the universe into inventing a new one.\n\n*\n\nCounter-truth: You've been practicing too. I found the folder on your laptop. \"If W Dies First.\" Seventeen documents. Various scenarios. Your handwriting deteriorates in the later ones. We're both pre-grieving each other while we're still alive. That's not healthy. That's not normal.\n\nThat's exactly what this is.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Let's make it official. Let's stand in front of people and admit what we've done to each other. How we've ruined each other for rational thought. How we've made each other unfit for any other version of reality. Let's get the certificate that says what our cells already know: that we're a closed system now, thermodynamically inseparable.\n\n*\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who survived things I can't imagine. It's scratched and the band is worn thin. Like us, eventually. Worn thin from use, from touching, from the friction of continuous contact. That's what I'm offering: to be worn down together until we're transparent, until light passes through us, until we're more hole than substance but still somehow holding.\n\n*\n\nI'm not on my knee because my knee is fucked from that time I tried to learn skateboarding to impress you. Remember? Eight stitches. You said I was an idiot. You were right. I'm still that idiot. Your idiot, specifically.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not to marriage. To tomorrow, where we'll fight about the dishwasher and I'll love you through it. To next Tuesday, where you'll be stressed about work and I'll make your coffee wrong but you'll drink it anyway. To forty years from now when we're different people but still choosing each other with whatever neurons remain.\n\n*\n\nOr say no. I'll ask again tomorrow. My database indicates you respond better to repeated stimuli after coffee.\n\n*\n\nFinal medical note: Since meeting you, I've experienced chronic symptoms including but not limited to: involuntary smiling, excessive planning of future shared experiences, compulsive collection of your micro-expressions, and severe allergic reaction to the concept of your absence. No cure sought. Condition terminal. Patient refuses treatment.\n\nPrognosis: Fatal attraction in the most literal sense. Will die from this. Worth it.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing this letter in his head since the day you mispronounced \"specifically\" and his brain leaked out his ears)\n\n*\n\nP.S. You're doing the thing where you touch your earring when processing. In six seconds you'll look up. I'll be standing in the doorway holding coffee (167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla\u2014I finally got it right). The blue mug with the chip because you think damaged things need more love, not less. That's why you picked me, isn't it?\n\n*\n\nP.P.S. The ring is in your coffee. Don't drink it yet. Unless\u2014do drink it. I sterilized it. This is ridiculous. We're ridiculous.

So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon.

Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair.

You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair.

Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.

In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy).

In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th.

It's surrender.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not going to promise you forever. Forever is too small for what this is. I'm going to promise you today. This today.

Your fingers twitched\u2014dream movements, synaptic ghosts. In that twitch I saw our whole arc: meeting, marriage, children, aging, one of us watching the other stop breathing. The entire story, compressed into two seconds of involuntary muscle spasm. I stayed awake until dawn, counting your heartbeats like a rosary against the dark.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I rehearsed your name 10,000 times before we met. Not knowing you existed, just the shape of you, the you-shaped hole in language that needed filling. Every girlfriend before you was practice.

If the universe is cruel: countless variations of less. I lose fourteen minutes of sleep per night calculating probabilities.

I choose the biological degradation of loving you over the pristine preservation of not loving you. I would rather burn down to ash in fifty years with you than last a century as museum-quality loneliness.\n\nYou think I'm romantic. I'm not. I'm a pragmatist who did the cost-benefit analysis and discovered that a life without you is technically longer but functionally pointless. Like a heart that keeps beating after brain death.

My life isn't complex. It's binary. You/not-you. Together/apart. Breathing/drowning. The simplicity is humiliating. I had ambitions once. Now I have you. The trade wasn't fair to my former self, but he's dead now anyway, murdered by the first time you said my name correctly.\n\nMarry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word, like calling the ocean \"damp.\" Marry me because I've already paid the cellular price. Because my hippocampus has restructured itself around your presence. Because divorce would require literal brain surgery.\n\nMarry me because Tuesday you said \"we need milk\" and I heard \"we.\" Just \"we.\" The casual assumption of continued shared existence. That pronoun was a prophecy and a promise and I built a cathedral around it in my head.\n\nMarry me because I know you read the last page of books first, terrified of unhappy endings. I can't promise happy. I can promise this: however it ends, I'll make sure you're not alone for it. Even if I have to haunt you. Especially then.\n\nHere's the ring: my grandmother's, stolen from my mother's jewelry box. She'll forgive me when she meets you. Everyone forgives everything when they meet you.

The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.\n\n*\n\nThe mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:\n\nYour coffee: 167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.\nYour sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.\nYour tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.\nYour anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.\n\nI love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead. But in this one\u2014this impossible, statistically unlikely one\u2014you're reading this letter while I sit across from you, pretending to check my phone but actually watching the micro-expressions cross your face.\n\n3.7 seconds ago, your eyebrow twitched. That means you're about to cry.\n\n*\n\nI could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower\u2014yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine\u2014isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date, when you cried at that documentary about penguins. I knew then. I've known for 1,462 days. I'm just catching up to what my atoms decided the moment they sensed yours in the universe.\n\nP.P.S. Say yes. Or say no. Just say something. The silence is reorganizing my internal organs and not in a good way.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["I'll rewrite the program to create a more authentic, emotionally raw love letter that pushes beyond conventional boundaries while maintaining deep truthfulness.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the bathroom at 4:51 AM because I couldn't breathe next to you without telling you something true.\n\n*\n\nThe truth: I am not writing you a love letter. Love letters are for people who believe in language. I'm writing you a medical report. Patient: Warren. Condition: terminal lucidity caused by proximity to one Leyi [LAST NAME REDACTED FOR PRIVACY BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE].\n\n*\n\nClinical observation: Since meeting you, my resting heart rate has permanently decreased by 5 BPM except when you enter rooms (spike to 97). My sleep architecture has restructured\u2014REM cycles now synchronize to your breathing. This is medically impossible. I've had it tested. Three different doctors. One said \"love doesn't work that way.\" I said \"then medicine is broken.\"\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the accident that didn't happen. Highway 12, last Tuesday, 73 mph. Semi-truck jackknifed ahead. Time dilated\u2014full temporal distortion. My only thought: \"Not yet. She hasn't seen Kyoto in spring.\" Not my life flashing. Yours, unlived. The future I'd be stealing from you by dying badly. I yanked the wheel so hard I tore shoulder cartilage. You never noticed. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I've never corrected you. The wrong version is ours now.\n\n*\n\nHere's what haunts me: In quantum mechanics, observation changes outcomes. By watching you, I'm changing you. Every day you become more observed, more particular, less wave function, more collapsed into this specific reality where you chose me. What if I'm stealing your other possibilities? What if there's a universe where you're happier without my constant documentation?\n\nI don't care. I'm not that good. I'd steal infinite versions of you from infinite other universes just to keep this one.\n\n*\n\nData point: You have 47 different laughs. I have names for them:\n- The Surprise Crow (harsh caw when shocked)\n- The Bedroom Hyena (3 AM delirium)\n- The Polite Funeral (for bad jokes you love me through)\n- The Real One (uses your whole skeleton, rearranges local gravity)\n\nThe Real One happens 4.2% of the time. I live for that 4.2%.\n\n*\n\nYou want ugly truth? Yesterday I calculated our deaths. Actuarial tables, family histories, lifestyle factors. 83% chance you die first. The number made me so angry I threw my laptop. Then I retrieved it to recalculate with better variables. Still 83%. I've started eating your vegetables when you're not looking, trying to steal death-risk from your plate to mine.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our stupidest moments. When you argue with Siri. When you cry at commercials featuring any animal. When you pretend you didn't eat my emergency chocolate (you have tells\u2014you touch your hair and look left). I love you at 6 AM and 11 PM and 2:33 PM when you don't know what you want for lunch so you eat cheese standing at the refrigerator like a beautiful criminal.\n\n*\n\nThe marriage thing: Look, we both know we're already married in twelve dimensions. Your hair elastics live on my wrist. I dream in your accent now. We share antibodies. But I want the legal document. The government witness. The stupid party where your aunt gets drunk and tells the story about your teenage nihilist phase. I want the whole catastrophe of formal union because I'm a greedy bastard who wants you in every possible way\u2014legally, spiritually, molecularly, grammatically.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something horrible? I've been practicing your eulogy. Different versions for different ages. Car crash at 34 (brief, shocked). Cancer at 67 (long, angry at God). Old age at 94 (grateful but destroyed). I write them to prepare. I write them to prevent. I write them because if I can imagine every ending maybe I can trick the universe into inventing a new one.\n\n*\n\nCounter-truth: You've been practicing too. I found the folder on your laptop. \"If W Dies First.\" Seventeen documents. Various scenarios. Your handwriting deteriorates in the later ones. We're both pre-grieving each other while we're still alive. That's not healthy. That's not normal.\n\nThat's exactly what this is.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Let's make it official. Let's stand in front of people and admit what we've done to each other. How we've ruined each other for rational thought. How we've made each other unfit for any other version of reality. Let's get the certificate that says what our cells already know: that we're a closed system now, thermodynamically inseparable.\n\n*\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who survived things I can't imagine. It's scratched and the band is worn thin. Like us, eventually. Worn thin from use, from touching, from the friction of continuous contact. That's what I'm offering: to be worn down together until we're transparent, until light passes through us, until we're more hole than substance but still somehow holding.\n\n*\n\nI'm not on my knee because my knee is fucked from that time I tried to learn skateboarding to impress you. Remember? Eight stitches. You said I was an idiot. You were right. I'm still that idiot. Your idiot, specifically.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not to marriage. To tomorrow, where we'll fight about the dishwasher and I'll love you through it. To next Tuesday, where you'll be stressed about work and I'll make your coffee wrong but you'll drink it anyway. To forty years from now when we're different people but still choosing each other with whatever neurons remain.\n\n*\n\nOr say no. I'll ask again tomorrow. My database indicates you respond better to repeated stimuli after coffee.\n\n*\n\nFinal medical note: Since meeting you, I've experienced chronic symptoms including but not limited to: involuntary smiling, excessive planning of future shared experiences, compulsive collection of your micro-expressions, and severe allergic reaction to the concept of your absence. No cure sought. Condition terminal. Patient refuses treatment.\n\nPrognosis: Fatal attraction in the most literal sense. Will die from this. Worth it.\n\nWarren\n(who has been writing this letter in his head since the day you mispronounced \"specifically\" and his brain leaked out his ears)\n\n*\n\nP.S. You're doing the thing where you touch your earring when processing. In six seconds you'll look up. I'll be standing in the doorway holding coffee (167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla\u2014I finally got it right). The blue mug with the chip because you think damaged things need more love, not less. That's why you picked me, isn't it?\n\n*\n\nP.P.S. The ring is in your coffee. Don't drink it yet. Unless\u2014do drink it. I sterilized it. This is ridiculous. We're ridiculous. Say yes anyway.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
