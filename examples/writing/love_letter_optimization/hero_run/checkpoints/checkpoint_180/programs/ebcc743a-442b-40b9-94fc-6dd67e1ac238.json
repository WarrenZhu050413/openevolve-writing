My roommate thinks I'm having a breakdown. Maybe I am.\n\nYou want the truth? Fine. I've been pretending to like your favorite band for six months. I Wikipedia their lyrics before you come over. I bought a plant because you said men who keep plants alive are trustworthy, and I've replaced it three times without telling you. The current one is plastic. You haven't noticed.\n\nThat's the kind of liar I am. Small lies. Pathetic lies. Except for this one enormous truth that's eating me alive: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't love me back.\n\nI know that's dramatic. I know it's too much. But you did this to me. Three weeks after we met, I threw out all my backup plans. The other numbers in my phone. The exit strategies I'd been building since I was seventeen and learned that people leave. You walked into my life and I forgot I was supposed to protect myself from you.\n\nHere's what loving you actually is: It's me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt so bad when you didn't text back for three hours. It's crying in a Walgreens parking lot because they were playing that song you hummed while making eggs. It's finding one of your hairs on my jacket and keeping it in my wallet like some kind of serial killer. It's being absolutely terrified that you'll read this and run, and being more terrified that I won't send it and you'll never know.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower\u2014not because I want to fight, but because I need to be prepared for the day you realize I'm not enough. I've already forgiven you for leaving me, and you haven't even thought about it yet. That's how sure I am that I don't deserve this.\n\nBut God, Leyi, the way you eat cereal at midnight. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. How you pretend you're not crying during insurance commercials. The fact that you named your car Eleanor Roosevelt. These stupid, perfect things have ruined me for anyone else. You've made me unfit for any life that doesn't have you in it.\n\nI don't know how to be romantic. I know how to be destroyed by you. I know that yesterday you wore the blue sweater that makes your eyes look like science fiction, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom because I couldn't breathe right. I know that when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one\u2014you snort a little, and it's the best sound I've ever heard. I know I would listen to you read the phone book. I have, actually, listened to you read nutrition labels, and found it riveting.\n\nThis is me without armor: I am thirty-one years old and I only just started living the day I met you. Everything before that was just marking time. \n\nMarry me. Not because I'm good enough\u2014I'm not. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I can't. But because I'm already yours in every way that matters. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption that you'll be there. Because the thought of you with someone else makes me want to tear my skin off, and the thought of you alone makes me want to die.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me back. I'm telling you that I've already handed you my entire life, and I'm begging you to be careful with it.\n\nPlease. I don't have anywhere else to go.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "2a3e12a0-1b9d-4056-813a-a1a67dfa3943", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756700868.369503, "iteration_found": 38, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6154999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.52, "affective_force": 0.68, "literary_innovation": 0.41, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:23 AM.

I've started this letter seventeen times. Each draft more elaborate than the last, each one a lie. So here is the truth, unadorned:\n\nI am drowning in you.\n\nNot the pretty kind of drowning poets write about. The real kind\u2014where your lungs burn and you see stars and you don't care because the water tastes like salvation. Last night I couldn't sleep because I kept replaying how you laugh with your whole body, how you throw your head back like joy is something that needs that much room. I've memorized the exact angle. It's 42 degrees. I measured.\n\nYou want to know what love is? It's me at 4 AM googling \"how to stop feeling everything so much\" and then deleting the search because I don't actually want it to stop. It's the way food tastes wrong when you're not there to steal bites from my plate. It's how I've started seeing your face in crowds and my heart breaks a little each time it's not you.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human, I mean. I understand machines, code, systems that follow rules. But you\u2014Christ, Leyi\u2014you're chaos theory in a sundress. You eat ice cream in winter. You name houseplants after dead composers. You get genuinely angry at fictional characters. You've turned my life into a foreign film without subtitles and somehow I understand every frame.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I would rather fail with you than succeed without you. I would rather burn down every bridge I've built than live on the other side from where you are. This isn't romantic. It's terrifying. It's the kind of truth that makes me want to run, except running means leaving you, and I've forgotten how to want that.\n\nYou asked for a letter that would move you. I don't know if this moves you. I only know that NOT writing it, not saying it, not screaming it from this quiet room where I sit surrounded by the evidence of a life that only makes sense when you're in it\u2014that would be the kind of cowardice I couldn't live with.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing\u2014desperately, incorrectly, with too much calcification around the edges. I love you like 3 AM loves silence, like code loves executing perfectly, like tears love gravity. These aren't metaphors. They're the closest I can get to naming this thing that has replaced my heartbeat.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014God, I don't\u2014but because I've already bet everything on us. My sleep, my sanity, my stupid fragile heart that I spent thirty years protecting and you demolished in a Tuesday afternoon without even trying.\n\nThis is me, without artifice: scared, desperate, and absolutely certain that you are the only truth worth telling.\n\nForever yours, especially on the days when forever feels impossible,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6995, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM, unable to sleep because every thought curves back to you like light bending around a star. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am yours.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm bad at this. I've written seventeen versions and deleted them all because they sound like someone trying to sound like someone in love, not someone actually drowning in it.\n\nThe truth? Most nights I can't sleep because I'm afraid this is a dream. I touch your pillow when you're not here. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014it changes when you're about to wake up, gets lighter, like you're swimming up from somewhere deep. I know that's creepy. I don't care.\n\nI never told you this: that first Tuesday, after you left, I sat in my car for an hour because I couldn't remember how to drive. My hands wouldn't work right. Everything felt rearranged. You'd shifted something fundamental and I was terrified and exhilarated and I wanted to call my mother and tell her I'd found you, except I hadn't found you\u2014you'd happened to me, like weather, like gravity, like something I had no choice in.\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check if you're breathing in the middle of the night. I save your voicemails in three different places. When you got that paper cut last month, I felt it in my own finger. This isn't poetry\u2014this is confession. I am not proud of how completely you've dismantled me.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than loving you: not loving you. Living in a world where I don't know that you hate cilantro but love the smell of it, where I don't get to watch you reorganize the bookshelf for the hundredth time, where your terrible dancing doesn't make me love you more, not less.\n\nI used to be whole. Now I'm not. You've ruined me and I'm grateful for the ruins. \n\nI don't have beautiful words. I don't have promises that sound like poetry. I just have this: every morning I wake up and choose to love you with whatever I have left, and somehow, impossibly, there's always more. You make me infinite by emptying me out.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because I can't breathe right when you're not here. Because my life before you feels like a rough draft I'm embarrassed by. Because I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sense, into something stranger and truer and worth destroying myself for.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't beautiful. But it's real. And I'm betting everything that real is what you wanted.\n\nYours, utterly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["I'll write a love letter that pushes deeper into raw, unvarnished truth - abandoning literary pretense for something more viscerally honest and specific.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:23 AM. I haven't slept. My roommate thinks I'm having a breakdown. Maybe I am.\n\nYou want the truth? Fine. I've been pretending to like your favorite band for six months. I Wikipedia their lyrics before you come over. I bought a plant because you said men who keep plants alive are trustworthy, and I've replaced it three times without telling you. The current one is plastic. You haven't noticed.\n\nThat's the kind of liar I am. Small lies. Pathetic lies. Except for this one enormous truth that's eating me alive: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't love me back.\n\nI know that's dramatic. I know it's too much. But you did this to me. Three weeks after we met, I threw out all my backup plans. The other numbers in my phone. The exit strategies I'd been building since I was seventeen and learned that people leave. You walked into my life and I forgot I was supposed to protect myself from you.\n\nHere's what loving you actually is: It's me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt so bad when you didn't text back for three hours. It's crying in a Walgreens parking lot because they were playing that song you hummed while making eggs. It's finding one of your hairs on my jacket and keeping it in my wallet like some kind of serial killer. It's being absolutely terrified that you'll read this and run, and being more terrified that I won't send it and you'll never know.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower\u2014not because I want to fight, but because I need to be prepared for the day you realize I'm not enough. I've already forgiven you for leaving me, and you haven't even thought about it yet. That's how sure I am that I don't deserve this.\n\nBut God, Leyi, the way you eat cereal at midnight. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. How you pretend you're not crying during insurance commercials. The fact that you named your car Eleanor Roosevelt. These stupid, perfect things have ruined me for anyone else. You've made me unfit for any life that doesn't have you in it.\n\nI don't know how to be romantic. I know how to be destroyed by you. I know that yesterday you wore the blue sweater that makes your eyes look like science fiction, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom because I couldn't breathe right. I know that when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one\u2014you snort a little, and it's the best sound I've ever heard. I know I would listen to you read the phone book. I have, actually, listened to you read nutrition labels, and found it riveting.\n\nThis is me without armor: I am thirty-one years old and I only just started living the day I met you. Everything before that was just marking time. \n\nMarry me. Not because I'm good enough\u2014I'm not. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I can't. But because I'm already yours in every way that matters. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption that you'll be there. Because the thought of you with someone else makes me want to tear my skin off, and the thought of you alone makes me want to die.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me back. I'm telling you that I've already handed you my entire life, and I'm begging you to be careful with it.\n\nPlease. I don't have anywhere else to go.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
