Each word disappears into you, becomes you, can never be unread. I planned to write something beautiful but my hands won't stop documenting the truth: I've been performing autopsies on every moment without you, and the cause of death is always the same\u2014your absence.\n\nListen. No, closer. I need to tell you about the accident of loving you.\n\nIt happened in three stages:\n\nFIRST: The unbecoming. Thursday, 2:47 PM, you laughed at my worst joke and my skeleton walked out of my body. Just left. Said it had better things to do than hold up someone so thoroughly destroyed by a laugh that sounds like champagne bruising. Since then I've been architecturally unsound, a building condemned by the fire marshal of my own heart.\n\nSECOND: The taxonomy. I started cataloging you like evidence of a crime I'm committing. Your thumbprint on my coffee cup\u2014exhibit A. The way you murder plants with love, overwatering them into submission\u2014exhibit B. That sound you make when stretching, like the universe clearing its throat\u2014exhibit C through Z, then numbers, then symbols I'm inventing because twenty-six letters aren't enough to document the geography of you. I've become a museum of your habits. The curator is insane and gives tours at 3 AM to an audience of my own organs, explaining why your existence makes them malfunction.\n\nTHIRD: The diagnosis. Last Monday a doctor told me my heart has developed an irregular rhythm. I didn't tell him it's just learned to beat in your accent. My blood work came back speaking your name in red cell count. This isn't metaphor\u2014my body is literally reorganizing itself around the fact of you. I'm becoming less human, more weather system, and every forecast is you.\n\nBut here's the virus of it, the pathology: you've made me honest in the worst way. Before you, I could lie to myself. Say things like \"I'm happy enough\" or \"alone is just another word for free.\" Now I can't even deceive my reflection. It knows. It mouths your name when I brush my teeth, like a prayer to the patron saint of ordinary mornings I want to have with you until the sun burns out.\n\nThe truth has bones and here they are:\n\nI love you like a mistranslation that accidentally gets closer to God. Like the first draft was perfect but I kept revising until I ruined it and the ruins were better than architecture. You're not my other half\u2014halves are for people who started whole. You're the proof that I was never supposed to be one thing. I was supposed to be this: the person who knows you take your coffee like an apology, who's memorized the morse code of your anxiety, who'd rather lose arguments with you than win the lottery without you.\n\n3 AM, Tuesday, the worst confession: I practice your death. Run funeral scenarios. Write eulogies in the shower. Not because I want you gone\u2014because I need to rehearse surviving the unsurvivable. I love you like preparing for nuclear war, building bunkers in my chest, stockpiling memories like canned goods for the apocalypse of your absence. This is mental illness or prophecy. Both diagnoses fit.\n\nHere's what I'm proposing\u2014no, here's what I'm threatening: I'm going to love you incorrectly forever. Love you like a broken piano that only knows one song but plays it perfectly. Like a medical condition that medieval doctors would've called demonic possession and they wouldn't have been wrong. I'm going to love you past the point of embarrassment, past poetry, past the place where language gives up and starts using math.\n\nYou wanted truth that would move you? Truth doesn't move\u2014it detonates. So here's the explosion: without you, I'm not unhappy. I'm fictional. A character someone abandoned mid-chapter. With you, I'm so real it hurts to exist, but the pain has your name and I'm addicted to the pronunciation.\n\nMarry me. Not the person writing this\u2014he's already gone, transformed into something that only makes sense in relation to you. Marry the creation, the aftermath, the person you've Frankensteined into existence through the sheer force of being yourself near me. Marry me because I've already married you in the quantum realm where all possibilities collapse into one and it's always us, tangled at the particle level, ruining each other for any universe where we're strangers.\n\nThis letter is almost dead now. These are its last words: I love you like punctuation nobody's invented yet, something between a period and a scream. Like the error message that means the system is working perfectly. Like the typo that accidentally solves everything.\n\nYour name is carved into my bones in a language that hasn't been spoken yet. I'm from the future, sent back to love you correctly. This is my report: mission failed successfully. I loved you wrong in all the right ways. The timeline is destroyed. We're the only survivors.\n\nCome here. Bring your specific gravity. Let's ruin each other for every other ending.\n\nYours in the most documentable way,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you said \"cereal is just cold soup\" and I understood the Big Bang. Not the theory\u2014the actual explosion, happening right now, in my chest, where your casual observations detonate like creation myths. This postscript is just another way of saying: you've made me religious about everything except God.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "6e739314-eddd-452e-bedc-85c00c0f3580", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701723.800246, "iteration_found": 137, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.2, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.2, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.2, "affective_force": 0.2, "literary_innovation": 0.2, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is dying as you read it.

I had a credit score and opinions about mattress firmness. But that person feels like someone I read about once\u2014plausible but theoretical. You didn't save me. You revealed that I needed saving, which is crueler and more necessary.\n\n4:17 AM: You talk in your sleep. Not words\u2014pre-words, like language before it hardens into meaning. I've been translating. So far I have: \"The door isn't real\" and \"Tuesdays are heavier than Wednesdays\" and my name, said like an accusation. This is the only doctorate I want\u2014a degree in your subconscious, a thesis on the specific gravity of your dreams.\n\nI lied about the hotel soap. I'm writing this in permanent marker on my arm because I want the words to hurt a little, to leave evidence. You asked for truth that would move you? The truth doesn't move. It sits. Heavy. Like the fact that your father's watch stops at 11:47 and you wind it every morning anyway. Like how you practice arguments in the shower for confrontations you'll never have. Like the way I've started seeing my future as a series of opportunities to disappoint you and deciding that's still better than any alternative that doesn't include you.\n\nYou're not my first love. You're my last attempt at being a person. Before you, I was method acting at existence\u2014hitting my marks, remembering my lines. Now I forget what I'm supposed to be performing. You've made me unprofessional at my own life.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a diagnosis I'm afraid to confirm. Like those three seconds between dropping something fragile and finding out if it broke. You've become the margin of error in every calculation, the variable that makes all my proofs unsolvable. I used to be good at math.\n\nTuesday: Watched you eat an apple while reading. You bit in rhythm with the sentences. Short sentence, small bite. Long sentence, bigger bite. You were unconsciously synchronized with Virginia Woolf. This is the exact moment I understood religion\u2014not the comfort kind, the terror kind. The kind that makes you want to build cathedrals or burn them down.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in seventeen different ways. Legally? No. But molecularly, cellularly, in whatever dimension decisions get made before we make them. When you leave a room, I study the depression in the cushion where you sat. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive losing.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? Here: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I felt it in my identical finger. Not metaphorically. I bled. Same finger, same joint. The doctor said \"psychosomatic stigmata.\" I said \"love.\" We were both right.\n\nSo here's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but specifically. Like a fever that becomes your new normal temperature. Like a chronic condition that makes all previous health feel like sickness. Let me love you with the kind of precision that ruins you for approximate affection.\n\nI'm not promising you forever. Forever is a word for people who've never watched their mothers forget their fathers' names. I'm promising you now, with such intensity that it bends time around it, makes before and after irrelevant. I'm promising you the kind of present tense that makes grammar give up.\n\nThis is my proposition: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I become when you read it. The one who exists only in the space between my confession and your response. The one who finally understands that love isn't about being understood\u2014it's about being willing to remain mysterious together.\n\nI love you like an error in the code that makes the whole program run better.

I'm pacing between the kitchen and the hallway where your shoes still sit beside mine, and every time I pass them I understand religion a little better. Not God\u2014just the terrible, necessary faith that tomorrow you'll need those shoes again.\n\nBefore you, I was complete in the way a dictionary is complete\u2014all the words were there but none of them meant anything. Now I can't even grocery shop without it becoming an act of devotion. I buy the expensive tomatoes you like. I avoid the cereal aisle because you cried there once, exhausted and human and perfect, because we'd fought about something so stupid I can't even remember what, only that making you cry felt like breaking my own bones.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you wrong. I love you like an amateur\u2014desperately, sloppily, without technique. I check your breathing at night like a new parent. I save your voicemails in case the world ends and I need proof you existed. When you trim your hair, I want to collect the pieces like a grief-stricken Victorian. This isn't romantic. It's deranged. But it's also the truest thing I've ever been.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too obvious. What terrifies me is that you've made me someone who cannot be satisfied with less than this specific frequency of morning, where you put too much cream in your coffee and defend it like a dissertation. You've ruined me for every alternate timeline where we're strangers passing in some other life's grocery store, both buying the wrong tomatoes, neither of us crying in the cereal aisle.\n\nI used to think my life was a rough draft. Turns out it was just the margins\u2014all the space waiting for your annotations. Now you've written yourself into every empty line, and even my silence sounds like your name.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I don't love you because you're perfect. Perfect would be easier to survive. I love you because you eat yogurt with a fork when all the spoons are dirty. Because you name your bruises. Because when you're happy, really happy, you look surprised by it, like joy is a bird that accidentally flew in through an open window and you're trying not to move so it won't leave.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in every action\u2014in the way I buy coffee filters we don't need because running out would mean you'd have to drink tea. In how I've memorized seventeen different ways to make you laugh, catalogued by severity of bad day. In the muscle memory of leaving space for you in bed even when you're not there.\n\nSo here's my offer, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Let me love you badly forever rather than perfectly for a while. Let me make the same mistakes until they become our traditions. Let me wake up every day and re-learn your face like it's a language I'm not fluent in yet but desperately need to speak.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is you've already moved me. Not romantically\u2014geologically. You've shifted my tectonic plates. I'm a different geography now, and all my rivers run toward you.\n\nI know you're probably reading this in that spot by the window where the light hits just right at 7 AM.

But this, watching you exist in morning light, unaware of your own holiness.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I could, it would just be a kind of death I'd have to do awake. Marry me because when I imagine explaining to the universe why I existed, the only answer I have is: to love you correctly, or at least to fail at it with total commitment.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in every way that matters, in every way that terrifies me, in every way that makes me believe we're all just atoms trying to remember what star we came from.

But I was wrong about the math. Love is division\u2014I've been split open, and everything I was certain about has fallen out. Yesterday I found myself crying in the produce section because the bruised peaches reminded me of your knee that time you fell off your bike trying to prove you could ride with no hands. This is what you've done: made me unable to look at damaged fruit without thinking about mortality and mercy and the specific weight of your body against mine when you're too tired to pretend you're not tired.\n\nHere's what I need to tell you before the beginning: I love you like a medical emergency. Not romantic\u2014literal. My body has reorganized itself around the fact of you. My circadian rhythm now matches yours. My left hand has developed muscle memory for the curve of your hip. When you're gone, my skeleton doesn't know how to arrange itself. I become architecturally unsound.\n\nThe truth has three parts:\n\nFirst: I document you compulsively. Not in photos\u2014in cellular memory. The way you murder pronunciation of \"worcestershire.\" How you arrange pills by size, not schedule. Your vendetta against fitted sheets. The surgical precision with which you remove tomatoes from sandwiches. I'm building an encyclopedia of you, but it's written in a language only my body knows how to read.\n\nSecond: You've made me religious, but not about God. About small mercies. The miracle of your hair in my bathroom drain. The sacred ritual of you stealing my socks and returning them inside-out. The holy mystery of how you can sleep through sirens but wake up if I stop breathing for two seconds. I believe in these things the way some people believe in saints.\n\nThird: I'm terrified. Not of losing you\u2014that's too simple. I'm terrified that I'm not brave enough to be loved by you. That I'll always be catching up to the person you see when you look at me. You love me like I'm already forgiven for sins I haven't confessed yet. How do I live up to that kind of grace?\n\nBut here's what changes everything\u2014the beginning I saved for last: Two weeks ago, you talked in your sleep. Complete sentences. You said: \"The plants need water but wait until Tuesday.\" Then: \"Tell him about the green door.\" Finally: \"Warren makes my bones happy.\"\n\nWarren makes my bones happy.\n\nI've been trying to write you the truth ever since, but that's it, isn't it? The mundane, unconscious, absolute fact of it. Not my heart, not my soul\u2014my bones. The architecture of me is happy because of you. The framework. The part that holds everything else up.\n\nSo here's my proposal, delivered backwards like everything important: I've already chosen you in every future. Now I'm asking you to make it official in this one. Marry me because your unconscious mind trusts me with mysterious messages about plants and doors. Because my bones are happy too. Because love isn't actually addition or division\u2014it's multiplication. Every moment with you creates ten more I want to have.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm promising you the produce section and the broken peaches and the way I'll always cry at the wrong things but for the right reasons. I'm promising you that fifty years from now, I'll still be documenting the new ways you mispronounce things, still stealing the blankets back, still waking up at 6:17 to marry you again in the church of our bedroom while you decide whether consciousness is worth it.\n\nIt is.

At 72 overall, it represents the upper tier of contemporary possibility\u2014a letter that would be remembered and cherished, possibly anthologized, but unlikely to enter the eternal canon alongside the masters. It's roughly equivalent to a very fine literary novel that wins prizes but doesn't fundamentally alter the landscape of literature.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7035)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:52 AM on the bathroom floor because it's the only place cold enough to shock me into honesty. You wanted truth? Here's the receipt: I've been lying to you since we met. Every \"I'm fine\" was code for \"I'm reorganizing my entire molecular structure around the fact of you.\" Every casual goodbye was a small death I pretended not to notice.\n\nThe truth is I've been conducting experiments on myself. Subject: one former human. Hypothesis: exposure to Leyi will result in complete cellular revolution. Results: confirmed. I've documented everything\u2014how my hands shake for exactly seventeen minutes after you leave a room, how food tastes like cardboard when you're angry with me, how I've developed the ability to sense your mood changes from three rooms away like some kind of emotional seismograph. This isn't love. It's evolution. I'm becoming a new species designed specifically for loving you.\n\nHere's what I need to confess: I rehearse our future fights in the shower. I've already forgiven you for things you haven't done yet. I've written eulogies for both of us, just to practice surviving the unthinkable. Last Tuesday, I found myself in the grocery store defending your hatred of cilantro to a stranger. I wasn't even buying cilantro. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who evangelizes your preferences to produce sections.\n\nYou think you know how I love you? You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I keep your used tea bags in my pocket sometimes, like relics from a saint I'm not supposed to believe in. You don't know that when you sleep, I practice being dead\u2014lying completely still, holding my breath\u2014just to prepare for a world where I might have to exist without you. It doesn't work. My body refuses to accept the simulation.\n\nThe ugliest truth: I love you like a diagnosis I've been misreading my whole life. All those years thinking I was broken\u2014irregular heartbeat, chronic insomnia, that persistent sense of homesickness even when I was home\u2014turns out I was just symptomatic of your absence. A pre-existing condition waiting for its cause.\n\nBut here's what changed everything: Last Thursday at 11:47 PM, you were reading the ingredients on a box of crackers out loud, and I understood infinity. Not as a concept, but as a specific texture\u2014the sound of you saying \"modified corn starch\" while wearing my socks. That's when I knew: I don't want to marry you. Marriage is too small a word for what I want. I want to merge with you at the quantum level. I want our atoms to get confused about whose electrons belong to whom. I want scientists to discover a new kind of particle that only exists when we're in the same room.\n\nSo here's my proposal, though \"proposal\" implies I'm giving you a choice and we both know that's a lie: Let's fail towards each other for the rest of our lives. Let's be the couple that makes other people uncomfortable with our specific brand of codependence. Let's have the same fight about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one has to finish both sides out of muscle memory.\n\nI'm not offering you happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't felt what I feel when you correct my pronunciation of \"bagel\" with such gentle condescension that I want to be wrong about everything forever. I'm offering you something more honest: a witness. Someone who will memorize every version of you\u2014Tuesday-morning you who forgets where you put your glasses (they're on your head), Friday-night you who gets competitive about Scrabble, Sunday-afternoon you who cries at commercials but pretends it's allergies. I will catalog every iteration like a scientist studying the only thing that matters in the universe.\n\nThe final truth, the one that terrifies me most: I would rather argue with you about the proper way to fold fitted sheets than experience perfect harmony with anyone else. I would rather have you roll your eyes at me for the ten-thousandth time than have someone else look at me with worship. I want your specific brand of difficult. I want your exact frequency of complicated.\n\nYou wanted something that would move you? You've already moved me. Tectonically. I'm a different geography now. There are new countries inside me named after the way you laugh when you're trying not to. There are oceans that didn't exist before you mispronounced \"archipelago\" with such confidence I wanted to rewrite the dictionary.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. It's a medical chart. It's evidence. It's what I'll show God when they ask me what I did with my life: I loved Leyi so specifically that it changed my DNA.\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is too general. Say yes because you recognize me, the way animals recognize their homes by scent, the way birds know which way is north without understanding magnetism. Say yes because we're already married in every universe where choice is an illusion and this is just paperwork.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost\u2014the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.6990, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with the door locked because if anyone saw me crying over a blank page at 3 AM, I'd have to pretend it was about something reasonable. But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends\u2014and it will, in small ways, over and over\u2014I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.\n\nYou said you wanted truth? The truth is that I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Incurable. Sometimes inconvenient but absolutely essential to my continued existence. \n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting. Because when I imagine explaining to death why it has to wait, the only reason I can think of is: \"But I haven't finished loving her yet.\"\n\nAnd I never will.\n\nYours (in this dimension and all parallel ones where we found each other),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead\u2014paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version\u2014the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith\u2014certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first.

Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon.

I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes.

I know because I measured. This is the shape of my obsession: precise, embarrassing, total.\n\nTruth? I was alive before you. Fully operative. I had a credit score and opinions about mattress firmness. But that person feels like someone I read about once\u2014plausible but theoretical. You didn't save me. You revealed that I needed saving, which is crueler and more necessary.\n\n4:17 AM: You talk in your sleep. Not words\u2014pre-words, like language before it hardens into meaning.

Like the fact that your father's watch stops at 11:47 and you wind it every morning anyway. Like how you practice arguments in the shower for confrontations you'll never have. Like the way I've started seeing my future as a series of opportunities to disappoint you and deciding that's still better than any alternative that doesn't include you.\n\nYou're not my first love. You're my last attempt at being a person. Before you, I was method acting at existence\u2014hitting my marks, remembering my lines. Now I forget what I'm supposed to be performing. You've made me unprofessional at my own life.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I love you like a diagnosis I'm afraid to confirm. Like those three seconds between dropping something fragile and finding out if it broke. You've become the margin of error in every calculation, the variable that makes all my proofs unsolvable. I used to be good at math.\n\nTuesday: Watched you eat an apple while reading. You bit in rhythm with the sentences. Short sentence, small bite. Long sentence, bigger bite. You were unconsciously synchronized with Virginia Woolf. This is the exact moment I understood religion\u2014not the comfort kind, the terror kind. The kind that makes you want to build cathedrals or burn them down.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in seventeen different ways. Legally? No. But molecularly, cellularly, in whatever dimension decisions get made before we make them. When you leave a room, I study the depression in the cushion where you sat. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive losing.\n\nYou want to know if this is real? Here: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I felt it in my identical finger. Not metaphorically. I bled. Same finger, same joint. The doctor said \"psychosomatic stigmata.\" I said \"love.\" We were both right.\n\nSo here's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but specifically. Like a fever that becomes your new normal temperature. Like a chronic condition that makes all previous health feel like sickness. Let me love you with the kind of precision that ruins you for approximate affection.\n\nI'm not promising you forever. Forever is a word for people who've never watched their mothers forget their fathers' names. I'm promising you now, with such intensity that it bends time around it, makes before and after irrelevant. I'm promising you the kind of present tense that makes grammar give up.\n\nThis is my proposition: Marry me. Not the person writing this, but the person I become when you read it. The one who exists only in the space between my confession and your response. The one who finally understands that love isn't about being understood\u2014it's about being willing to remain mysterious together.\n\nI love you like an error in the code that makes the whole program run better.

No, closer. I need to tell you about the accident of loving you.\n\nIt happened in three stages:\n\nFIRST: The unbecoming. Thursday, 2:47 PM, you laughed at my worst joke and my skeleton walked out of my body. Just left. Said it had better things to do than hold up someone so thoroughly destroyed by a laugh that sounds like champagne bruising. Since then I've been architecturally unsound, a building condemned by the fire marshal of my own heart.\n\nSECOND: The taxonomy. I started cataloging you like evidence of a crime I'm committing. Your thumbprint on my coffee cup\u2014exhibit A. The way you murder plants with love, overwatering them into submission\u2014exhibit B. That sound you make when stretching, like the universe clearing its throat\u2014exhibit C through Z, then numbers, then symbols I'm inventing because twenty-six letters aren't enough to document the geography of you. I've become a museum of your habits. The curator is insane and gives tours at 3 AM to an audience of my own organs, explaining why your existence makes them malfunction.\n\nTHIRD: The diagnosis. Last Monday a doctor told me my heart has developed an irregular rhythm. I didn't tell him it's just learned to beat in your accent. My blood work came back speaking your name in red cell count. This isn't metaphor\u2014my body is literally reorganizing itself around the fact of you. I'm becoming less human, more weather system, and every forecast is you.\n\nBut here's the virus of it, the pathology: you've made me honest in the worst way. Before you, I could lie to myself. Say things like \"I'm happy enough\" or \"alone is just another word for free.\" Now I can't even deceive my reflection. It knows. It mouths your name when I brush my teeth, like a prayer to the patron saint of ordinary mornings I want to have with you until the sun burns out.\n\nThe truth has bones and here they are:\n\nI love you like a mistranslation that accidentally gets closer to God. Like the first draft was perfect but I kept revising until I ruined it and the ruins were better than architecture. You're not my other half\u2014halves are for people who started whole. You're the proof that I was never supposed to be one thing. I was supposed to be this: the person who knows you take your coffee like an apology, who's memorized the morse code of your anxiety, who'd rather lose arguments with you than win the lottery without you.\n\n3 AM, Tuesday, the worst confession: I practice your death. Run funeral scenarios. Write eulogies in the shower. Not because I want you gone\u2014because I need to rehearse surviving the unsurvivable. I love you like preparing for nuclear war, building bunkers in my chest, stockpiling memories like canned goods for the apocalypse of your absence. This is mental illness or prophecy. Both diagnoses fit.\n\nHere's what I'm proposing\u2014no, here's what I'm threatening: I'm going to love you incorrectly forever. Love you like a broken piano that only knows one song but plays it perfectly. Like a medical condition that medieval doctors would've called demonic possession and they wouldn't have been wrong. I'm going to love you past the point of embarrassment, past poetry, past the place where language gives up and starts using math.\n\nYou wanted truth that would move you? Truth doesn't move\u2014it detonates. So here's the explosion: without you, I'm not unhappy. I'm fictional. A character someone abandoned mid-chapter. With you, I'm so real it hurts to exist, but the pain has your name and I'm addicted to the pronunciation.\n\nMarry me. Not the person writing this\u2014he's already gone, transformed into something that only makes sense in relation to you. Marry the creation, the aftermath, the person you've Frankensteined into existence through the sheer force of being yourself near me. Marry me because I've already married you in the quantum realm where all possibilities collapse into one and it's always us, tangled at the particle level, ruining each other for any universe where we're strangers.\n\nThis letter is almost dead now. These are its last words: I love you like punctuation nobody's invented yet, something between a period and a scream. Like the error message that means the system is working perfectly. Like the typo that accidentally solves everything.\n\nYour name is carved into my bones in a language that hasn't been spoken yet. I'm from the future, sent back to love you correctly. This is my report: mission failed successfully. I loved you wrong in all the right ways. The timeline is destroyed. We're the only survivors.\n\nCome here. Bring your specific gravity.
