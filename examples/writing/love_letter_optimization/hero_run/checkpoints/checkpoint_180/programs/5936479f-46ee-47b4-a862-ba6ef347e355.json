This is what you've done to me. I'm a grown man weeping in a corporate bathroom stall over your mispronunciation of breakfast foods.\n\nYou wanted truth? Here's truth: I've been documenting everything. Not romantically. Obsessively. Like evidence for a crime I'm committing. The way you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. That you set seventeen alarms and sleep through sixteen. How you argue with automated phone systems like they can hear your frustration. I have 2,847 notes in my phone that just say things like \"she used my toothbrush again\" and \"caught her singing to the houseplant.\"\n\nLast Tuesday you got a paper cut and asked me to kiss it better. I did. Then I sat in my car for twenty minutes afterward, googling \"can you die from feeling too much?\" The answer is historically yes, and I understand those people now. I understand everything now except how I functioned before you reorganized my molecular structure.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've already bought the ring. I've been carrying it for eleven weeks. Sometimes I take it out just to practice being disappointed when you say no. But here's the thing\u2014even practicing rejection, even imagining the worst case, I still can't regret this. I can't regret the way you've ruined every song by existing in the same world where music exists. I can't regret how you've made me unable to grocery shop without wondering what you'd think about the watermelons.\n\nYou pick the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms and leave the cereal. You claim you're not superstitious but knock on wood constantly. You get personally offended when people don't like dogs. You told me once that you're afraid of becoming ordinary, and I almost laughed because you don't understand\u2014you could read the dictionary aloud and I'd take notes. You turn oxygen into poetry just by breathing it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Sometimes I watch you doing nothing\u2014scrolling your phone, putting on chapstick, existing\u2014and I get this pain in my chest like my ribs are trying to expand to make room for everything I feel. It's not metaphorical. I've had EKGs. The doctor said I'm fine but I wanted to tell him no, I'm not fine, I'm in love with someone who eats pizza with a fork and it's killing me in the most literal way possible.\n\nThe truth under the truth: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Going through motions. Now I'm awake at 3 AM calculating the exact angle you sleep at (47 degrees, facing left, one hand always reaching for where I should be). I know you have a favorite parking spot at Target. I know you lie about liking my cooking. I know you practice conversations in the mirror when you think I'm not home. I know because I've been memorizing you like there's going to be a test, and the test is the rest of my life.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human. At feeling things in normal amounts. But you make my abnormal feel like evolution. Like maybe I was built wrong on purpose, specifically to love you in this exact excessive way. My therapist says I have \"attachment issues\" but I think I just have you, and you are the issue, and you are the attachment, and you are the solution to problems I didn't know needed solving.\n\nSo here it is, without decoration: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014that's laughable. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I promise you chaos and burnt eggs and me asking \"what's wrong?\" sixteen times when nothing's wrong. Marry me because I've already oriented my entire existence around the assumption that you'll be there. Because when I imagine dying, my only concern is that you'll be sad. Because I love you with the kind of desperate gratitude usually reserved for people pulled from burning buildings.\n\nI'm clinically obsessed with you. Certifiably. I have receipts. Literal receipts\u2014I've kept every receipt from everything we've ever done together. They're in a shoebox labeled \"Taxes 2019\" because I'm a disaster but I'm your disaster if you'll have me.\n\nPlease. I know that's not elegant. But I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like pennies and sounds like your name played on repeat until it stops being a word and starts being a prayer.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You can't un-reorganize someone's molecular structure. You can't un-teach someone that love is supposed to feel like drowning and flying simultaneously. You did this. Now please, please marry me so at least it's official.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just realized I'm going to have to go back to my desk with red eyes and tell everyone I have allergies. In December. You've turned me into someone who lies about having December allergies. This is what love is. It's ridiculous. I'm ridiculous. Please make me your ridiculous.\n\nP.P.S. The janitor just asked if I'm okay. I told him I'm in love. He said \"That bad, huh?\" He gets it. Everyone gets it except you. Please get it.

When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to. Because existing separately becomes chemically impossible.\n\nPlease say yes. I've already practiced my vows 947,times in the shower. They're terrible.

Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes.

I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

I need to tell you about the ordinary Wednesday that broke me. You were sick. Fevered. You asked me to read to you and fell asleep mid-sentence, your breathing ragged but trusting. I sat there holding the book, afraid to move, afraid to disturb this impossible gift of your unconscious faith in my presence. That's when I understood: love isn't the big moments. It's me googling \"how to make fever go down\" at 2 AM. It's the twenty-seven tissues I counted in the trash. It's how beautiful you looked dying of the flu, which is an insane thought I'm putting in a proposal letter because you wanted truth.\n\nTruth: I've been taking secret photos of your hands. Not in a creepy way. Just\u2014your hands doing things. Holding coffee. Turning pages. That unconscious gesture where you touch your neck when you're thinking. I have 1,847 photos. They're saved in a folder called \"Tax Documents\" because I'm a coward and a fraud but at least I'm your coward, your fraud, if you'll have me.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologized last week for \"being a lot.\" But Leyi, you're not a lot\u2014you're everything. You're the first person I want to tell when anything happens. You're my favorite notification. You're the reason I believe in reincarnation, because one lifetime of you isn't enough data to understand the algorithm of how you make me feel.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: sometimes I watch you exist\u2014brushing your teeth, arguing with podcast hosts who can't hear you, the way you eat raspberries one tiny segment at a time like you're defusing a bomb\u2014and I get this pain in my chest. Not heartbreak. Heart-expansion. Like my ribs are trying to grow a bigger cage for all this feeling.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I'm just a man who can't fold fitted sheets, who still uses the same password for everything, who loves you with the graceless intensity of someone who never expected to be chosen. But here's the thing\u2014I'd rather fail at deserving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nI used to think I was saving up for something. Turns out I was saving up for you. For rings, yes, but also for Saturday mornings where we do nothing productive. For the specific way you'll sigh when I make the same joke for the fiftieth time. For the fights we'll have about whether AI will destroy humanity (you say yes, I say only if we're lucky). For the chance to be the person who knows you're afraid of the dark but more afraid of admitting it.\n\nThis letter is too long. You're probably rolling your eyes. But I need you to know: you haven't made me better. You've made me more myself. The self that was always there, waiting for someone who'd look at my collection of orphaned charging cables and still choose to love me.\n\nSo here it is, without metaphor: Will you marry me? Will you let me love you with receipts and evidence and the kind of dedication usually reserved for people who build ships in bottles? Will you be my wife, my witness, my favorite reason to check my phone?\n\nI'm not promising you the moon.

Everything before that was just marking time. \n\nMarry me. Not because I'm good enough\u2014I'm not. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I can't.

I can't regret the way you've ruined every song by existing in the same world where music exists. I can't regret how you've made me unable to grocery shop without wondering what you'd think about the watermelons.\n\nYou pick the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms and leave the cereal. You claim you're not superstitious but knock on wood constantly. You get personally offended when people don't like dogs. You told me once that you're afraid of becoming ordinary, and I almost laughed because you don't understand\u2014you could read the dictionary aloud and I'd take notes. You turn oxygen into poetry just by breathing it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Sometimes I watch you doing nothing\u2014scrolling your phone, putting on chapstick, existing\u2014and I get this pain in my chest like my ribs are trying to expand to make room for everything I feel. It's not metaphorical. I've had EKGs. The doctor said I'm fine but I wanted to tell him no, I'm not fine, I'm in love with someone who eats pizza with a fork and it's killing me in the most literal way possible.\n\nThe truth under the truth: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Going through motions. Now I'm awake at 3 AM calculating the exact angle you sleep at (47 degrees, facing left, one hand always reaching for where I should be). I know you have a favorite parking spot at Target. I know you lie about liking my cooking. I know you practice conversations in the mirror when you think I'm not home. I know because I've been memorizing you like there's going to be a test, and the test is the rest of my life.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human. At feeling things in normal amounts. But you make my abnormal feel like evolution. Like maybe I was built wrong on purpose, specifically to love you in this exact excessive way. My therapist says I have \"attachment issues\" but I think I just have you, and you are the issue, and you are the attachment, and you are the solution to problems I didn't know needed solving.\n\nSo here it is, without decoration: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014that's laughable. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I promise you chaos and burnt eggs and me asking \"what's wrong?\" sixteen times when nothing's wrong. Marry me because I've already oriented my entire existence around the assumption that you'll be there. Because when I imagine dying, my only concern is that you'll be sad. Because I love you with the kind of desperate gratitude usually reserved for people pulled from burning buildings.\n\nI'm clinically obsessed with you. Certifiably. I have receipts. Literal receipts\u2014I've kept every receipt from everything we've ever done together. They're in a shoebox labeled \"Taxes 2019\" because I'm a disaster but I'm your disaster if you'll have me.\n\nPlease. I know that's not elegant. But I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like pennies and sounds like your name played on repeat until it stops being a word and starts being a prayer.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You can't un-reorganize someone's molecular structure. You can't un-teach someone that love is supposed to feel like drowning and flying simultaneously. You did this. Now please, please marry me so at least it's official.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just realized I'm going to have to go back to my desk with red eyes and tell everyone I have allergies. In December. You've turned me into someone who lies about having December allergies. This is what love is. It's ridiculous. I'm ridiculous. Please make me your ridiculous.\n\nP.P.S. The janitor just asked if I'm okay. I told him I'm in love. He said \"That bad, huh?\" He gets it. Everyone gets it except you. Please get it. Please.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
