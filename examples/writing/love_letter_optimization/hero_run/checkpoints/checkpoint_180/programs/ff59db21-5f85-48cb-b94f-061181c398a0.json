My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back.

Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things.

Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.

My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally.

This is what truth does to a body that's spent three years lying about being okay without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nStart here: I've been keeping receipts. Literal receipts. Every place we've been. $7.42, bodega coffee, you put salt in yours by mistake and drank it anyway to not make the owner feel bad. $234.67, emergency room visit, you thought you were dying but it was just your first panic attack and you held my hand so hard you left bruises shaped like forgiveness. $0.00, sunset on the roof, you said \"we're going to die\" and I said \"I know\" and we kissed like punctuation at the end of the world's longest run-on sentence.\n\nTotal: $48,293.12 worth of proof we existed in the same timeline. I keep them in a shoebox labeled \"EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE\" though I'm not sure what I'm defending against except maybe the possibility that I imagined you.\n\n*\n\nYou want truth? I've been writing your eulogy since our fourth date. Not because I'm morbid. Because my brain insists on preparing for every universe where I have to explain you to strangers using past tense. Version 26 starts: \"She ate ice cream in winter.\" Version 89: \"She was allergic to cats but pet them anyway.\" Version 132, the one I practice in the shower: \"She taught me that love isn't a feeling, it's a location. And I'm still standing there, in Tuesday, October 9th, 3:47 PM, when she looked at me like I was both the question and the answer.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what happened: Before you, I was fluent in seven programming languages. Now I can barely remember English. Yesterday I called a spoon \"the soup shovel.\" My coworker asked what was wrong with me. I said \"I'm in love\" and he said \"Oh\" like I'd announced terminal illness. Maybe he's right. Maybe this is terminal. The way you've metastasized through my whole system. Inoperable. Untreatable. Chronic condition: You.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the birds. Every morning, 5:23 AM, they start. Same three notes. I used to sleep through it. Now I wake up and think: they're announcing you're still alive. The birds know. They're not singing, they're taking attendance, and every morning you're still here, still breathing at 67 breaths per five minutes (I've counted), still existing despite the statistical impossibility of two people finding each other in a universe this vast and hostile to permanence.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. Three of your bobby pins. The fortune from the cookie you didn't eat (it says \"Your future is written in another's heartbeat\"\u2014too on the nose, universe). A voicemail where you're crying about your grandmother. I play it sometimes just to remember you're real enough to grieve. These stolen objects are my insurance policy against forgetting.\n\nBut also: You steal from me. Every morning you take my first thought. Every night, my last exhale. You've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you're not stealing my covers, my fries, my favorite side of the bed. You're a thief and I'm Stockholm syndrome incarnate, in love with my captor.\n\n*\n\nThe accident that almost happened: Interstate 90, eighteen-wheeler jackknifed. I saw it happening in slow motion and thought: Not her. Take me. Rearrange the physics. I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Missed by inches. You were singing that song you always get wrong. You never knew how close. I pulled over later and threw up from relief. You thought it was the gas station sushi. I let you think that. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n*\n\nYou know what I realized at 3 AM last Thursday? Love isn't addition. It's division. I'm half a person now. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically\u2014literally. I put my keys in the refrigerator. I wore two different shoes to work. I tried to unlock my apartment with my MetroCard. My brain only works in your proximity. This is probably a medical condition. I don't want to be cured.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for the romance. Not for the symbolism. But because my DNA has already rewritten itself to include you in its survival requirements. Because my sleep cycle synchronized to yours without permission. Because my immune system recognizes you as self, not other. At this point, leaving you would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you need exactly four ice cubes in your drinks. Because I've memorized the seventeen different ways you sigh and what each one means. Because I've already planned our fights about paint colors and whose parents to visit for holidays and whether our hypothetical children should learn piano or violin (both, obviously).\n\nMarry me because last week you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that would concern cardiologists. Because you've seen me ugly-cry at a Pixar movie and still let me hold your hand in public. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where we can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, hidden in the ice cream you'll eat tonight at 11:17 PM (you always do when you can't sleep). It belonged to my grandmother who said yes during the Depression because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\"\n\nWe have more time than they did. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're different people who happened to love each other once.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not proposing a fairy tale. I'm proposing a documentary. The real kind, where sometimes we're boring, sometimes we're cruel, sometimes we forget to be grateful. Where we fight about money and get old and lose our edges. Where one of us gets sick first. Where one of us has to learn to sleep alone again.\n\nBut also: where we get 20,000 mornings of you stealing my coffee. Where your hair goes gray and I get to watch it happen. Where we become those old people who still hold hands and everyone assumes we just met but really we've been holding hands so long we've forgotten how to let go.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical conspiracy between neurons. Say yes because you already know the weight of my silence. Because your things are already here. Because we've been practicing forever since the day we met.\n\nSay yes because the alternative\u2014a universe where I don't know that you eat pickles when you're sad, where you don't steal my socks, where I don't get to watch you win arguments with furniture\u2014isn't a universe worth inhabiting.\n\n*\n\nI love you like a grudge. Like a debt. Like a chronic condition. Like the ocean loves drowning things. Like tomorrow loves lying about being guaranteed.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like I'm trying to love you for all the parallel universes where we never met. Like I'm trying to make up for all the centuries that happened before you.\n\nBut also: I love you like Tuesday loves Wednesday. Quietly. Inevitably. Without alternative.\n\n*\n\nCome find me. I'm in the kitchen, pretending to read, failing to breathe. When you walk in, I'll pretend I wasn't waiting. We both know I'm lying. We both know you know. This is what love is: lying together about the small things so we can tell the truth about the big ones.\n\nThe big truth: You're going to say yes. Not because of this letter. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because you already named our hypothetical dog. Because we've both been married to each other since before we met, just waiting for our bodies to catch up with what our atoms already knew.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every receipt, every timestamp, every piece of evidence that you existed, that we existed, that this impossible thing happened)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is crying. The right one will start in three seconds. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date when you cried at the aquarium. Not at the dolphins. At the jellyfish. You said they looked lonely. That's when I knew I'd love you wrong for the rest of my life.\n\nP.P.S. The ring might be cold. But you'll wear it anyway. You can't help yourself with surprises. You're already reaching for the freezer. I'm watching. I'll always be watching. That's either a promise or a threat. Both. Everything is both with us.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7295, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with your pen\u2014the one you chew when thinking.

I wanted to warn you about me then. How I catalog exits. How I love like the house is already on fire.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I still have the receipt from our first coffee. $8.47.

My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5\u00b0F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.\n\nI bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're already wearing it. You can't help yourself with surprises. Your tell is that you touch your hair when hiding something. You're doing it now.

It's the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited, that little 'pacific' that somehow contains entire oceans. It's how you eat ice cream in winter because \"temperature is just a social construct,\" then steal my jacket anyway. It's the seventeen seconds every morning between when I wake and when I remember you're real, and how those seventeen seconds of forgetting make the remembering feel like winning the universe on repeat.\n\nI've been keeping inventory.

I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter 200 times in my head, deleted 199 for containing the word \"soul.\" I'm terrified that I love you more than you love me, and equally terrified of the opposite. When you had the flu last March, I googled \"can you die from someone else's fever\" because your suffering felt like mine but worse\u2014mine I could bear, yours rewired my understanding of unbearable.\n\nBut here's the thing about truth\u2014it's smaller than we think. It's not \"I would die for you\" (though I would). It's \"I'll kill the spiders even though I'm also afraid.\" It's not \"you complete me.\" It's \"before you, I never noticed I was incomplete.\" It's this: when I imagine different futures, you're the only constant that doesn't feel like a limitation but like the opposite\u2014like suddenly having infinite variables because with you, even the ordinary becomes unprecedented.\n\nI could tell you about the Sunday you cried at the ending of that ridiculous movie about penguins, how your empathy for animated birds made me want to be worthy of living on the same planet. I could map the constellation of freckles on your left shoulder (Orion's belt, but better). I could confess that I've already planned our arguments twenty years from now, and how even in imagination, your angry face makes me want to kiss you until we forget what we were fighting about.\n\nInstead, I'll tell you this: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity, or the speed of light\u2014something fundamental that doesn't require belief to be true. I love you at the quantum level, where observation changes everything and nothing simultaneously. I love you past the heat death of the universe, which sounds like hyperbole but feels like underselling it.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know that tomorrow without you is just time, not a future. Marry me because we've already started forever; I'm just asking for the paperwork. Marry me because when I say your name, even in my head, my mouth makes the shape of home.\n\nYours in this universe and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. \u2013 If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to learn interpretive dance.

You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I see the program has achieved a strong fitness score of 0.8570, with particularly high marks in affective_force (0.89) and phenomenological_authenticity (0.87).
