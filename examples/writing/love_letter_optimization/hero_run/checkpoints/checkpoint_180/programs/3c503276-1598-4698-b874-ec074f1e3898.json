Not because this is hard to write, but because once I start, I know something will change between us. Either you'll say yes and we'll begin. Or you'll say no and we'll end. Both possibilities make my hands shake.\n\nI'm not good at this. I'm the man who practiced ordering coffee for three months before I could do it without stuttering. Who still counts stairs when I'm nervous. Who loved you for exactly 517 days before I could say it out loud. I counted. I have spreadsheets.\n\nHere's what you need to know: I was okay before you. I had systems. Breakfast at 7:15. Lunch at 12:30. Bed by 11. I was a functioning adult with a savings account and matching socks. Then you happened, and now I eat cereal at midnight because you think breakfast food is a feeling, not a time. I have one sock. Just one. The other one is probably wherever you leave your hair ties\u2014that parallel dimension where important things go to test our commitment to finding them.\n\nYou cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You apologize to furniture. You've read the same book forty-three times because \"it's different each time.\" You can't whistle but you try every morning like it might suddenly work. You save fortunes from fortune cookies in chronological order. You name spiders. You trust too easily. You forgive too quickly. You love like it's your first language when everyone else is still learning the alphabet.\n\nThe truth: I document you obsessively. Tuesday: you ate seven grapes, one at a time, while reading. Wednesday: you hummed Beethoven's 9th off-key for two hours. Thursday: you cried because the old man at the bus stop looked lonely. Friday: you made me smell your coffee because it \"smelled like happiness.\" Saturday: you fell asleep on my shoulder during the movie you picked. Sunday: you woke up and the first thing you said was \"I dreamt we were penguins.\" Monday: you exist. You exist and that's enough to reorganize my entire understanding of luck.\n\nI know about the baby scare. When your period was late. You didn't tell me but I knew. I saw you checking the calendar. Counting. Recounting. I saw you buy the test and throw it away unopened. I saw you cry in the bathroom with the door locked. I wanted to tell you I was scared too. But also: I wasn't. If it had been real, if there had been a baby, I would have figured it out with you. We would have been terrible and perfect and figured it out.\n\nYour mother thinks I'm not enough for you. She's right. Your father thinks you could do better. He's right too. But here's what they don't know: You talk in your sleep. Full sentences. Last Tuesday you said, \"Warren, the penguins are here.\" Wednesday: \"We need more purple.\" Thursday: \"Don't let go.\" Even unconscious, you're building a world where I exist. How am I supposed to not love someone whose dreams include me?\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Being worthy. But that's not what this is. This is recognition. Like finding a note you wrote to yourself and forgot about. Like coming home to a house you've never seen but knowing where the light switches are. You're not my other half\u2014I was whole. You're my proof that \"whole\" was too small a goal.\n\nThat night my father called me a failure\u2014you made instant ramen and added an egg. You didn't say he was wrong. You said, \"Good. Fail at their dreams. Succeed at your own.\" Then you ate all the noodles and left me the egg because you know I only like the egg. How did you know that's what I needed to hear? How do you always know?\n\nI love you. I love you in the boring parts. When you're reading ingredients on cereal boxes. When you're plucking your eyebrows and making faces at yourself. When you're asleep and drooling and your breath smells like morning. When you're angry about something you can't name. When you're scrolling through your phone ignoring me. I love you at 2 PM on Wednesdays. I love you in fluorescent lighting. I love you when you're ordinary. Especially when you're ordinary.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years, through a war, through immigration, through my grandfather forgetting her birthday thirty-seven times. When she died, she gave it to me. Said one word: \"Wait.\" I've been waiting. Not for someone perfect. For someone who makes me want to be imperfect with them forever.\n\nMarry me. Not the question\u2014the answer. The answer to why I wake up. The answer to what I'm doing with my life. The answer to who I call when the world ends or when I see a really good dog.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Wednesday afternoons and tax forms and whose turn it is to call the plumber. I'm promising you the flu and funeral homes and the terrifying possibility that we'll become our parents. I'm promising you that I'll try. Every day, I'll try to deserve the accident of finding you.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I've already chosen you in every scenario I can imagine. Even the ones where you say no. Even the ones where you leave. I'll still be choosing you, just from farther away.\n\nI love you. I know that's not enough but it's also everything. It's the only true thing I have to offer. I love you and I want to keep loving you until one of us stops breathing, and then probably a little after that too, just to be thorough.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald the spider is actually Geraldine. I googled it. Female spiders are bigger. I haven't told you because you're already attached and I don't want you to have a gender crisis about a spider. This is the kind of stupid, protective thing I'll do for the rest of our lives if you let me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "fac22fff-ea08-4b80-8dd5-5e1f19799e4a", "generation": 4, "timestamp": 1756701454.661621, "iteration_found": 104, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6204999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.52, "affective_force": 0.68, "literary_innovation": 0.46, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:42 AM.

It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak.

It's 4:47 AM. I've been awake since Tuesday. Time doesn't work right anymore. It pools in moments where you laugh and drains away when you're gone, leaving me gasping in temporal drought.\n\nI need to tell you something terrible: I was happy before you. That's the cruelest part. I had constructed a sufficient life\u2014books, silences, the reliable disappointment of myself. I was a master of small contentments. Then you walked into that caf\u00e9, apologizing to a chair you'd bumped into, and my careful sufficiency detonated. Now I'm radioactive with wanting more.\n\nThe truth isn't beautiful. The truth is that I catalogue your flaws like holy relics. The way you can't whistle. Your vendetta against cucumbers. How you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. That terrifying thing you do where you love people who don't deserve it, like me. I hoard these imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I haven't invented you from the wishbone of my loneliness.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning at my parents' house\u2014you were green, genuinely green, heaving into their heirloom vase\u2014my mother said later, \"She's not very sturdy, is she?\" And I thought: No, she's not. She's breakable and strange and apologizes to furniture and I would burn down the world to keep her safe. That's when I knew this wasn't love anymore. It was something more dangerous. It was recognition. Like finding my own kidney in another person's body.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. Leyi, \"enough\" is a word invented by people who've never watched you try to save dead houseplants with CPR. Who've never seen you leave voice messages for your grandmother who died three years ago because you can't bear to delete her number. You're not enough\u2014you're too much. You're excessive. You're what happens when the universe forgets to be careful.\n\nI've started to understand religion because of you. Not God\u2014that's too simple. But the holy terror of being chosen by something you don't deserve. Every night you choose to sleep beside me feels like a bureaucratic error in heaven that no one's caught yet. I wake up at 3 AM just to watch you breathe, to confirm the miracle is still happening, that they haven't recalled you for being incorrectly distributed to someone like me.\n\nDo you want to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's watching you eat cereal at midnight, milk dripping onto your constellation of a nightshirt, and thinking: I would die without this. Not metaphorically. Literally. My cells would forget their purpose. It's calculating the precise angle you tilt your head when you're about to cry and positioning myself to catch you. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday afternoons when you're just reading and I have to leave the room because the sight of you existing makes my chest cavity feel too small.\n\nThat Thursday when my father called me a disappointment again\u2014thirty-four years old and still his favorite failure\u2014you didn't say I wasn't. You said, \"Good. Disappoint him more. Disappoint everyone who wanted you small.\" Then you made me instant ramen, the cheap kind, and added an egg exactly the way sadness tastes better. How did you know that was the antidote? How do you always know which version of me needs which version of you?\n\nHere's my confession: I've already married you in every way that matters. In the quantum mechanics of my intention. In the cellular democracy where every atom voted yes.

Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word for this catastrophe. Marry me because I've already died and been resurrected by you so many times that my death certificate is basically fiction. Marry me because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014is a paradox that makes physics uncomfortable. Marry me because I bought your grandmother's thimble from your aunt and had it made into a ring, and if you don't wear it, I'll have to explain to a thimble why it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're already terminal with each other. This is just asking permission to name the disease.\n\nI am yours in the way that rivers are the ocean's\u2014inevitably, gravitationally, without other options.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's ordinary. You've made me unfit for any life but the one where you can't whistle and I love the trying.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Not metaphorically\u2014literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

The same way my heart beats without my consent. Automatic. Necessary. Irreversible.\n\nBefore you, I understood my life. I had plans. Logical progressions from A to B to C. Then you. You were never part of the plan. You were the end of all plans. The beginning of something I have no map for.\n\nThree moments. That's all it took.\n\nFirst: You, reading in the park, forgot the world existed. A bee landed on your book. You didn't brush it away. You waited. Patient. Like you understood something about kindness I'm still trying to learn.\n\nSecond: That terrible dinner party. You knew nobody. I watched you save a dying conversation with a question about whether colors have sounds. By the end, strangers were confessing childhood dreams. You have this gift\u2014you make people remember they're interesting.\n\nThird: 2 AM, you called crying. Your grandmother was dying. You said, \"I don't know how to do this.\" I said, \"Nobody does.\" We sat on the phone, breathing together, not talking. That silence\u2014that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I'd never stop.\n\nYou're afraid you're ordinary. Leyi, ordinary people don't apologize to furniture when they bump into it. Ordinary people don't name their plants after composers. Ordinary people don't see a homeless man and remember his name is Thomas and he likes his coffee with honey, not sugar.\n\nYou're not ordinary. You're specific. Irreplaceable. The world is different because you're in it.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Proving. But loving you isn't something I chose or achieved. It's something that happened to me. Like lightning. Like gravity. Like the laws of physics reorganizing themselves around a new constant.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not perfection. Not poetry. Just this\u2014every morning for the rest of my life, I'll choose you. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you.\n\nNot because you need me to. You don't need anyone\u2014you're complete all by yourself. That's the point. You don't need me but you want me anyway. That impossible gift.\n\nI keep the ticket from our first movie. You fell asleep twenty minutes in, drooled on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went numb. It was the best pain I ever felt.\n\nThat's what loving you is\u2014the best pain. The kind that reminds you you're alive.\n\nI could list what I love: Your laugh\u2014not the polite one, the real one, the snort that surprises you. How you eat ice cream in winter because \"sadness doesn't have a season.\" The way you touch books like they're sleeping cats. How you can't pass a dog without asking its name.\n\nBut that's not it. I love what I don't know yet. The person you'll be in ten years. Twenty. Fifty. The ways you'll change that will surprise us both. The fights we haven't had. The apologies we haven't made. The ordinary Wednesday afternoon when we'll look at each other and think: we made it.\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot the question. The answer. To every question I haven't thought to ask. To the person I'm becoming because you exist. To the life that's only real when you're in it.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just a word. I'm promising you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Each one chosen. Each one yours.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years. Never took it off. When she was dying, she gave it to me. Said, \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\"\n\nI can't live without you. Not won't. Can't. The way lungs can't live without air. Simple. Factual. True.\n\nI'm done being scared of how much I love you. It's like being scared of my own heartbeat. Pointless. It's going to keep happening whether I'm brave about it or not.\n\nSo this is me being brave: You are my person. My only person. The person I'll look for in every room for the rest of my life.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'll still love you tomorrow. And tomorrow.

I've written and deleted this seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nThe truth: I was complete before you. That's what makes this so frightening. I had built a quiet, functional life. I knew how to be alone. I was good at it. Then you happened, and now I can't remember why I thought that was enough.\n\nYou should know who you're considering marrying. I'm the man who still checks if the door is locked three times. Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters. Because in the face of that absolute certainty, we get to choose what we do with the time between now and then.\n\nI choose you. Not the idea of you, not the future with you, but you\u2014this specific human who saves fortunes from fortune cookies in books, who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, who can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. I choose your mundane Wednesday self, your inconvenient sadnesses, your embarrassing enthusiasms.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for sixty-seven days. Some nights I take it out and practice this moment. But this isn't practice anymore. This is the real attempt, the shaking hands, the imperfect words. This is me, Warren, the anxious man who loves you with a specificity that borders on madness, asking you, Leyi, the woman who changed my understanding of time itself, to marry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you\u2014words are just words. But because you've already moved me. Physically. Molecularly. Into a different person who believes, for the first time, that he deserves to be loved by someone who eats sandwiches from the inside out.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. These are not contradictions.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the atomic structure of my existence. The rest is just paperwork.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I love you.

Here's attempt twenty-four.\n\nThe truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because \"I love you\" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

Each draft felt like a translation of something untranslatable, like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never opened their eyes.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had memorized all its conjugations\u2014the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where \"home\" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book\u2014not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling \"Leyi'd.\" You've become a verb in my private dictionary.\n\nRemember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.\n\nThe truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not \"December\" but \"six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets.\" Not \"Thursday\" but \"three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like.\" My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.\n\nBut here's what scares me most\u2014I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.\n\nSo this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy\u2014you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.\n\nMarry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you'd have no place to put it. I'm offering you my mornings, my muscle memory, my most boring parts. I'm offering to merge our loneliness into something unrecognizable. To become so intertwined that archaeologists will argue about where you end and I begin.\n\nThe ring is in my sock drawer, wrapped in the receipt from our first dinner when you ordered three desserts and no main course. It's been there for sixty-seven days. I count them like a rosary, each day a bead of wanting to ask but waiting for the perfect words.\n\nThese aren't them. Perfect words don't exist for this. But imperfect words, trembling words, words that trip over themselves rushing toward you\u2014maybe those are the only ones worth saying.\n\nLeyi, my love, my ghost-whisperer, my collector of broken beautiful things: Will you marry me? Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me\u2014relocated me entirely\u2014into a country where your yes is the only citizenship I want.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain.

Once, screaming into fluorescent hospital light\u2014a date they put on forms. The second time was quieter: the moment you looked at me over that broken umbrella in the rain and said, \"Well, we're already wet.\" That's when I actually began.\n\nBefore you, I was a competent ghost. I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code. This is just what truth looks like when it's pretending to be words.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I can see the fitness has declined from 0.7320 to 0.6970.

I haven't slept. Not because this is hard to write, but because once I start, I know something will change between us. Either you'll say yes and we'll begin. Or you'll say no and we'll end. Both possibilities make my hands shake.\n\nI'm not good at this. I'm the man who practiced ordering coffee for three months before I could do it without stuttering. Who still counts stairs when I'm nervous. Who loved you for exactly 517 days before I could say it out loud. I counted. I have spreadsheets.\n\nHere's what you need to know: I was okay before you. I had systems. Breakfast at 7:15. Lunch at 12:30. Bed by 11. I was a functioning adult with a savings account and matching socks. Then you happened, and now I eat cereal at midnight because you think breakfast food is a feeling, not a time. I have one sock. Just one. The other one is probably wherever you leave your hair ties\u2014that parallel dimension where important things go to test our commitment to finding them.\n\nYou cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You apologize to furniture. You've read the same book forty-three times because \"it's different each time.\" You can't whistle but you try every morning like it might suddenly work. You save fortunes from fortune cookies in chronological order. You name spiders. You trust too easily. You forgive too quickly. You love like it's your first language when everyone else is still learning the alphabet.\n\nThe truth: I document you obsessively. Tuesday: you ate seven grapes, one at a time, while reading. Wednesday: you hummed Beethoven's 9th off-key for two hours. Thursday: you cried because the old man at the bus stop looked lonely. Friday: you made me smell your coffee because it \"smelled like happiness.\" Saturday: you fell asleep on my shoulder during the movie you picked. Sunday: you woke up and the first thing you said was \"I dreamt we were penguins.\" Monday: you exist. You exist and that's enough to reorganize my entire understanding of luck.\n\nI know about the baby scare. When your period was late. You didn't tell me but I knew. I saw you checking the calendar. Counting. Recounting. I saw you buy the test and throw it away unopened. I saw you cry in the bathroom with the door locked. I wanted to tell you I was scared too. But also: I wasn't. If it had been real, if there had been a baby, I would have figured it out with you. We would have been terrible and perfect and figured it out.\n\nYour mother thinks I'm not enough for you. She's right. Your father thinks you could do better. He's right too. But here's what they don't know: You talk in your sleep. Full sentences. Last Tuesday you said, \"Warren, the penguins are here.\" Wednesday: \"We need more purple.\" Thursday: \"Don't let go.\" Even unconscious, you're building a world where I exist. How am I supposed to not love someone whose dreams include me?\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Being worthy. But that's not what this is. This is recognition. Like finding a note you wrote to yourself and forgot about. Like coming home to a house you've never seen but knowing where the light switches are. You're not my other half\u2014I was whole. You're my proof that \"whole\" was too small a goal.\n\nThat night my father called me a failure\u2014you made instant ramen and added an egg. You didn't say he was wrong. You said, \"Good. Fail at their dreams. Succeed at your own.\" Then you ate all the noodles and left me the egg because you know I only like the egg. How did you know that's what I needed to hear? How do you always know?\n\nI love you. I love you in the boring parts. When you're reading ingredients on cereal boxes. When you're plucking your eyebrows and making faces at yourself. When you're asleep and drooling and your breath smells like morning. When you're angry about something you can't name. When you're scrolling through your phone ignoring me. I love you at 2 PM on Wednesdays. I love you in fluorescent lighting. I love you when you're ordinary. Especially when you're ordinary.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years, through a war, through immigration, through my grandfather forgetting her birthday thirty-seven times. When she died, she gave it to me. Said one word: \"Wait.\" I've been waiting. Not for someone perfect. For someone who makes me want to be imperfect with them forever.\n\nMarry me. Not the question\u2014the answer. The answer to why I wake up. The answer to what I'm doing with my life. The answer to who I call when the world ends or when I see a really good dog.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Wednesday afternoons and tax forms and whose turn it is to call the plumber. I'm promising you the flu and funeral homes and the terrifying possibility that we'll become our parents. I'm promising you that I'll try. Every day, I'll try to deserve the accident of finding you.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I've already chosen you in every scenario I can imagine. Even the ones where you say no. Even the ones where you leave. I'll still be choosing you, just from farther away.\n\nI love you. I know that's not enough but it's also everything. It's the only true thing I have to offer. I love you and I want to keep loving you until one of us stops breathing, and then probably a little after that too, just to be thorough.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald the spider is actually Geraldine. I googled it. Female spiders are bigger. I haven't told you because you're already attached and I don't want you to have a gender crisis about a spider. This is the kind of stupid, protective thing I'll do for the rest of our lives if you let me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
