Teeth marks on the cap. I taste them sometimes when you're not home. This is the kind of thing that would disgust me about anyone else.\n\nTruth: I've been rehearsing your death since our second date. When you ordered dessert, I thought: she believes in the future. I wanted to warn you about me then. How I catalog exits. How I love like the house is already on fire.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I still have the receipt from our first coffee. $8.47. I've done the math\u2014if I frame it, the UV damage will fade the ink completely in 94 years. I'll be dead by then, but someone will find it: a blank rectangle that once proved we began. This keeps me awake.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: Yesterday, I couldn't remember my mother's maiden name for three seconds. My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5\u00b0F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.\n\nI bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're already wearing it. You can't help yourself with surprises. Your tell is that you touch your hair when hiding something. You're doing it now. I'm watching through the crack in the door like a creep who loves you. Come here. Let me see it on you.

Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays.

I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head.

Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are.

Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater lie than any failed attempt at truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound reorganized the atoms of my universe. I've been trying to make you laugh ever since, not for the joke itself, but to witness that precise tilt of your head, the way your left eye crinkles slightly more than your right, how you cover your mouth as if beauty could be hidden.\n\nI love you in the ordinary moments\u2014when you forget I'm watching and become entirely yourself. The way you bite your lower lip reading difficult passages. How you unconsciously hum that melody from your childhood when you cook. The fierce concentration when you're solving problems, as if the world depends on it. Perhaps mine does.\n\nYou asked for truth. Here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing. I'm terrified of not being enough, of my words falling short, of time being finite when what I feel for you demands eternity. Some nights I lie awake calculating the hours we have left if we live to eighty, and the number always feels like theft.\n\nBut then morning comes, and you're there, and your presence makes cowards of my fears. We build our small forevers in coffee conversations, in shared silences that speak volumes, in the way our hands find each other without looking. You've taught me that love isn't a grand gesture but a thousand tiny choices to turn toward each other.\n\nI cannot promise you perfection. I can promise that when the world feels too heavy, I'll help you carry it. When joy arrives, I'll celebrate with you as if we've won the universe. When you doubt yourself, I'll be your mirror, reflecting back the brilliant truth of who you are.\n\nMarry me, not because I've written pretty words, but because you already know the answer in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before sleep when pretense falls away.

Here\u2014take it:\n\nI am thirty-one years old and have been dying since the moment I understood you could die first. This is not metaphor. My cells literally age faster from the stress of loving you. Scientists would call it oxidative damage. I call it the price of admission.\n\nLet me be precise: At 11:43 PM on a Thursday you don't remember, you fell asleep with your hand on my chest. Your fingers twitched\u2014dream movements, synaptic ghosts. In that twitch I saw our whole arc: meeting, marriage, children, aging, one of us watching the other stop breathing. The entire story, compressed into two seconds of involuntary muscle spasm. I stayed awake until dawn, counting your heartbeats like a rosary against the dark.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I rehearsed your name 10,000 times before we met. Not knowing you existed, just the shape of you, the you-shaped hole in language that needed filling. Every girlfriend before you was practice. I loved them like learning scales before playing Chopin. Forgive me. Or don't. The truth doesn't require absolution.\n\nHere: more truth. When you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one, but the one that breaks out of you like an escaped prisoner\u2014my amygdala floods with the same chemicals our ancestors felt seeing the sun after winter. Evolutionary biology reducing us to chemistry. But also: transcendence. Both true. The paradox of meat that dreams.\n\nI've done the math. If we're lucky: 19,710 days. If typical: 14,600. If the universe is cruel: countless variations of less. I lose fourteen minutes of sleep per night calculating probabilities. Those stolen minutes add up to three months of consciousness I've sacrificed to anxiety about losing you. The irony is perfect and terrible.\n\nBut listen\u2014this is important\u2014I choose it. The shortened telomeres, the cardiovascular damage from chronic worry, the neurons worn smooth from repetitive fear. I choose the biological degradation of loving you over the pristine preservation of not loving you. I would rather burn down to ash in fifty years with you than last a century as museum-quality loneliness.\n\nYou think I'm romantic. I'm not. I'm a pragmatist who did the cost-benefit analysis and discovered that a life without you is technically longer but functionally pointless. Like a heart that keeps beating after brain death. Medically alive, philosophically extinct.\n\nYesterday you used the word \"sonder\"\u2014the realization that everyone has a life as complex as yours. But you're wrong about me. My life isn't complex. It's binary. You/not-you. Together/apart. Breathing/drowning. The simplicity is humiliating. I had ambitions once. Now I have you. The trade wasn't fair to my former self, but he's dead now anyway, murdered by the first time you said my name correctly.\n\nMarry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word, like calling the ocean \"damp.\" Marry me because I've already paid the cellular price. Because my hippocampus has restructured itself around your presence. Because divorce would require literal brain surgery.\n\nMarry me because Tuesday you said \"we need milk\" and I heard \"we.\" Just \"we.\" The casual assumption of continued shared existence. That pronoun was a prophecy and a promise and I built a cathedral around it in my head.\n\nMarry me because I know you read the last page of books first, terrified of unhappy endings. I can't promise happy. I can promise this: however it ends, I'll make sure you're not alone for it. Even if I have to haunt you. Especially then.\n\nHere's the ring: my grandmother's, stolen from my mother's jewelry box. She'll forgive me when she meets you. Everyone forgives everything when they meet you. It's a superpower you don't know you have.\n\nThe stone is flawed\u2014a carbon impurity that jewelers call a \"cloud.\" Perfect. We're all just carbon, temporarily arranged into consciousness, clouded with the defect of knowing we're temporary. Wear it as a reminder that even our flaws are made of stars.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

It's terrifying. It's me at twenty-three thinking I understood the world until you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized sweater and suddenly every poem I'd ever read was kindergarten nonsense. It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile.

Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things.

I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.

I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most?

That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion).

Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code.

Here's what death taught me: nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just black. No tunnel, no light, no peace. But when I came back, my first thought was your name. Not relief. Not fear. Just \"Leyi.\" Like my neurons were arguing with death itself: you can have the rest but not this. Not her name.\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM because I just realized something terrible. I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.\n\nThe truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost.

Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are.

Premeditated. No remorse.\n\n*\n\nThree moments that murdered who I used to be:\n\n1. October 9th, 2:34 PM: You explaining quantum entanglement while eating yogurt. A strand of hair caught on your lip. The universe split. In one version, I reached out to move it. In this version, I didn't. Both versions died of love.\n\n2. The hospital, your appendix surgery: They let me hold your hand during prep. You said, \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Then, softer: \"Just kidding. Leave everything. Let them know I was human.\" That's when I knew I'd marry you.\n\n3. Yesterday: You parallel parked perfectly while singing off-key Radiohead. I thought: This is how civilization ends. Not with bombs but with me, in a Honda Civic, suddenly understanding infinity.\n\n*\n\nThings I cannot say with my mouth but can write:\n\nSometimes I wake up and count the bones in your hand to make sure you're real. Twenty-seven. Always twenty-seven. The relief makes me nauseous.\n\nI've already written your eulogy. Also mine. In both, I lie about how we met. The truth is too ordinary: Tuesday, coffee shop, you complained about Wi-Fi. But ordinary is the holiest word I know now.\n\nWhen you cry, your left eye starts first. Always. I've built my entire religion around this fact.\n\n*\n\nThe physicist's proposal:\n\nConsider two particles, entangled. Separate them by galaxies. Disturb one\u2014the other responds instantly. This violates everything. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" He was wrong about the spooky part. It's just love. The universe is built on it. We're not metaphors for physics; physics is a metaphor for us.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: Not death. Tuesday, April 10th, 2089. You'll die first (statistically). I've already forgiven you for this. What terrifies me is Wednesday, April 11th, 2089. Then Thursday. Then the heat death of the universe, which will happen faster than those Wednesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's the legal part: Marry me for tax purposes. For hospital visitation rights. For the banality of shared dental insurance. Marry me for the DMV forms. For the mortgage applications. For the school emergency contact lists. For every stupid document that demands we declare ourselves in binary terms: single or taken. Let me check \"taken\" with the cosmic permanence of a black hole's event horizon.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for this:\n\nBecause I've memorized the GPS coordinates of every place you've laughed (37 locations and counting). Because I know you're afraid of butterflies but not moths (this makes no sense and perfect sense). Because when you sleep, you hold your breath for seven seconds every third minute, and I've learned to breathe in your rhythm so we're synchronized even unconscious.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is insufficient. The sentence structure implies subject/verb/object. But you're not object. You're the verb itself. You're the loving. The state change. The quantum leap between what I was and what I am.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- One ring (hidden in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about)\n- This letter (draft #\u221e)\n- A heart that beats in iambic pentameter when you're near\n- The rest of my Wednesdays\n- All my dark matter\n- Everything after the decimal point\n\n*\n\nThe beginning, which is also the end: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. We got married the moment you laughed at my stupid joke about entropy. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nBut if you need the ritual:\n\nWill you marry me retroactively? Will you make honest what we've already been living? Will you let me call you wife so I can explain to strangers why I look like I've seen God?\n\nThe answer lives in your left eye. Already crying.\n\n\u2014W\n\nPS: The ring is behind the mint chocolate chip. You'll find this note there too, because I know you're reading this while I'm at work, and I know what happens next: you, freezer, ice cream, tears, yes. Time isn't linear. We've always been married.

You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5\u00b0F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.\n\nI bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're already wearing it. You can't help yourself with surprises. Your tell is that you touch your hair when hiding something. You're doing it now. I'm watching through the crack in the door like a creep who loves you. Come here. Let me see it on you. Let me see the rest of my life on your finger.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
