But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing.

You were the real version I'd been missing.\n\nI need to confess: I've been documenting your flaws. Writing them down like evidence. The way you interrupt yourself mid-sentence. How you leave cabinets open like you're conducting an orchestra of doors. That you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. I'm collecting your imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I didn't invent someone this essential to my breathing.\n\nListen. Yesterday you were singing in the shower\u2014off-key, wrong lyrics, a complete demolition of Leonard Cohen\u2014and I sat outside the door taking notes on how happiness sounds when it doesn't know it's being observed. This is what I've become: someone who takes field notes on joy. Someone who needs evidence that beauty this mundane exists. Someone who would rather study the archaeology of your Tuesday morning mood than discover new continents.\n\nThe truth is worse than poetry: You've broken me into someone I don't recognize. I used to have opinions about wine. I used to care about promotions. Now? Now I measure success by how many seconds I can make you laugh. I gauge time by proximity to your skin. My ambitions have shrunk to the size of our kitchen table\u2014just large enough for two plates, two cups, the daily wreckage of trying to love correctly.\n\nHere's what I know: We're going to fail at this. We're going to fight about money and families and the way I breathe too loud when I concentrate. You're going to hate me sometimes. I'm going to disappoint you in ways we can't imagine yet. We're going to grow old and strange and forget why we started this.\n\nBut also: Your hand fits in mine like it was manufactured there. When you sleep, you reach for me across the darkness like a plant reaching for light\u2014unconscious, necessary, beyond choice. We've already started growing into each other's empty spaces. We're already ruined for other people's love.\n\nThree facts about us:\n1. We're not soulmates. Soulmates would be easier. We're something messier\u2014two panicked animals who found the same hiding spot during the same storm.\n2. I love you more. This isn't romantic. It's math. You could survive me leaving. I've already forgotten how to exist without the threat of your absence.\n3. We both know how this ends. Badly, like all love stories. But between now and then, we get to make breakfast. We get to mispronounce each other's names in the dark. We get to fail at being enough but keep trying anyway.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense\u2014nothing about us makes sense. We're too different, too difficult, too much ourselves to ever properly merge. Marry me because that's the point. Because love isn't about finding your missing half. It's about finding someone whose damage rhymes with yours. Whose specific crazy makes your crazy make sense.\n\nMarry me because I've already carved out space for you in my bones. Because leaving you now would be like trying to return a vital organ\u2014technically possible but why would anyone survive that?\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not the fairy tale. Not even happiness. Just this\u2014someone who will notice when you change the part in your hair. Someone who knows you need to sleep with one foot outside the covers or you have nightmares about drowning. Someone who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to be okay.\n\nI'm asking you to say yes to the mortgage we can't afford and the health scares we won't see coming. Yes to becoming boring together, to developing the same allergies, to finishing each other's complaints. Yes to a life that looks nothing like what either of us planned but exactly like what we've already started building in the dark when we think no one's looking.\n\nLeyi, my favorite mistake, my necessary disaster\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm just finally admitting what my body already knows: that I've been saying your name in my sleep since the day we met. That I've been practicing my last words and they're all your name. That I'd rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nThe ring isn't romantic. It's evidence.

Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods.

The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now.

We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness.

We're sitting in a kitchen I don't recognize, not talking, just existing in the same space, and it's the most romantic thing I've ever imagined. Just lasting. Just being Tuesday-morning-ordinary together forty years from now. I wake up from that dream happier than from any fantasy of youth or beauty or passion. Because old means we made it. Old means we chose each other ten thousand times.\n\nBut here's what scares me: You're complete without me. You have friends who knew you before your heart included me. You have jokes I don't understand, songs that matter for reasons you've never explained. You existed before me and you'll exist after me and sometimes when you laugh at something on your phone that has nothing to do with us, I feel like I'm watching you from outside my own life. Like I'm already a ghost.\n\nSo let me be clear about what I'm asking: I'm not asking you to need me. You don't. You're whole. I'm asking you to choose me anyway. To wake up every morning and decide that yes, this strange, desperate man who catalogs your breathing patterns and cries at grocery stores is worth keeping. I'm asking you to let me earn you, daily, badly, with burnt coffee and forgotten anniversaries and all the ways I'll fail to be what you deserve.\n\nThe stupidest thing: I can't remember what my favorite color was before it became the exact brown of your eyes in afternoon light. I can't remember what silence sounded like before it filled with your breathing. I've been colonized by you so completely that I don't exist in the past tense anymore. There's just now, with you, and the future, which is just now with you, repeated.\n\nLast thing: Remember when you asked if I believed in God? I said I didn't know. That was true then. But now I do. I believe in the God who created whatever mathematics makes one person split into two bodies just so they could spend a lifetime finding each other. I believe in the God who invented your specific laugh, the one that sounds like champagne feels. I believe in whatever force makes your hand find mine in your sleep, unconscious and certain.\n\nMarry me. Not because it makes sense. It doesn't. Marry me because we've already carved each other into shapes that won't fit with anyone else. Marry me because the word \"wife\" sounds like a prayer when I imagine saying it about you. Marry me because I've already given you everything soft and breakable in me, and you've held it so carefully that I've started to believe I might be worth keeping.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I can hear you in the kitchen, humming off-key while making tea. You're using my mug. You always use my mug when I'm not there, like you're borrowing my shape. That small theft is the most romantic thing that's ever happened to me. Come find me. I'll be in the bathroom, sitting on the floor, waiting to see if this letter makes you run toward me or away. Either way, I had to tell you. The weight of not telling you was breaking my ribs from the inside.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7355)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:14 AM. Not because I woke early, but because I never slept. Sleep requires accepting that you're not here, and my body refuses the lie.\n\nThree truths:\n\nFirst: I have memorized you incorrectly on purpose. In my version, you never doubted us. In my version, that Tuesday when you said \"maybe we should talk\" never happened. I've edited you into someone who could never leave, because the alternative\u2014the real you, with your real freedom to choose\u2014terrifies me more than dying.\n\nSecond: I've been stealing from you. Time, mostly. Those extra seconds when I pretend to still be asleep so you'll hold me longer. The minutes I add to grocery runs so you'll miss me enough to kiss me like you mean it when I return. I'm a thief building a fortune from your attention, and I'll never have enough.\n\nThird: You've broken me. Specifically, the part that knew how to be alone. I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.\n\nLast week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours. I think you're my soulmate and I'm just your current coordinates. This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe\u2014I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows\u2014that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.\n\nBut also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else. I would rather be your disappointment than someone else's happiness. If you leave me, I'll understand. But I'll never recover. I'll be ninety years old, still setting two plates for dinner, still checking my phone for texts you'll never send.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready\u2014we're not. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is that we pretend this is temporary, and that lie is the only thing that could actually kill us.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that ruins a person for anyone else. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you admit you're already mine?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been there for six months. I touch it constantly, like a rosary, like proof that this bravery exists somewhere in me. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7525, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth: I have been dead for most of my life. Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you. You're reading it now because I finally realized: the fear of losing you by asking is nothing compared to the certainty of losing you by not asking. Come find me. I'll be in our kitchen, making coffee wrong\u2014your wrong\u2014waiting for my life to begin or end with your answer.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7295, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis morning you asked if I was happy and I couldn't answer because happiness is too small a word for what you've done to me.\n\nListen: Before you, I understood myself. I had edges, boundaries, a working definition. Now? Now I'm a rough draft of something I can't pronounce. You've made me illegible to myself. When I try to think without you, it's like trying to breathe underwater\u2014technically possible but missing the point entirely.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what's changed. My hands now automatically shape themselves to hold yours, even when you're not here. Empty air, curved just so. My sleep has reorganized itself around your breathing\u2014when you're gone, my body keeps your rhythm anyway, faithful as a metronome. I've started reading books backward because you mentioned once that endings are just beginnings in disguise. Everything I knew how to do, I'm learning again through the lens of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've been happy exactly twice in my life. Once, age seven, catching fireflies in a jar, not knowing they'd die by morning. Once, three weeks ago, watching you eat cereal in my shirt, and you looked up\u2014mouth full, uncommitted to swallowing\u2014and said \"what?\" like I was the strange one. That's it. Two moments of pure, unconscious joy, and one of them is you with breakfast food. This is what I'm working with. This is why I'm writing at 4 AM.\n\nThe truth? I've already lived our whole life. While you're sleeping, I fast-forward through decades. I've watched us argue about paint colors, make up in grocery stores, grow old in ways we swore we wouldn't. I've buried you a thousand times in my mind and survived none of them. When you wake up and ask about coffee, I'm already grieving the day you won't. This is insane. I know this. But knowing changes nothing.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong\u2014constant, incorrect, mine. I love you like the 27th letter of the alphabet\u2014necessary but unpronounceable. I love you past the point of metaphor into pure fact: when you're not here, I malfunction. Small things. Can't remember which way doorknobs turn. Forget the word for common objects. Yesterday I called a spoon \"the soup paddle\" because my brain was busy calculating how many hours until you came home.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance\u2014romance is for people who can still distinguish themselves from each other. Marry me as a medical necessity. As evolutionary fact. As admission that we've already grown into each other like two trees that started out separate but are now sharing rings, counting years in the same bark.\n\nMarry me because when you're not here, I practice conversations with your absence. Because I've started seeing colors that don't exist yet, and they all need names that rhyme with yours. Because last Tuesday you killed a spider with my poetry book and apologized to the spider, not the book, and I thought: this is the person I want to misunderstand the world with forever.\n\nI'm not offering you my best self. I'm offering you this: the only self that makes sense anymore. The one that knows you take eleven seconds to decide you're awake. The one that's memorized the specific weight of your sadness, the exact temperature of your joy. The one that would rather be terrible with you than perfect with anyone else.\n\nLeyi\u2014my favorite fact, my necessary error, my only proof that time moves forward\u2014will you marry me? Not because we should, but because we already did, somewhere between the first laugh and the forty-third time you stole my socks. Say yes. Say yes so I can stop holding my breath. Say yes because the alternative\u2014this careful distance, this practiced composure\u2014is killing us both and we're too interesting to die of politeness.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I already know your answer. You told me in your sleep last week. You said \"okay, but you're doing the dishes forever.\" I accept your terms.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.2000, Type: Exploratory)\n```python\n5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Alternative combined_score approach, Alternative phenomenological_authenticity approach\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it true.\n\nI was thirty-two years old when we met. I had been thirty-two for six years already\u2014same routines, same face in the mirror, same answers to the same questions. Then you walked into that bookstore, looking for something by Murakami, and suddenly I was nineteen. Suddenly I was eighty. Suddenly I was every age at once, all of them in love with you.\n\nYou were wearing your green coat. The one with the missing button you keep meaning to fix. You still haven't fixed it. I love that button for staying lost.\n\nHere's what happened: You picked up the wrong book\u2014Mishima, not Murakami\u2014and started reading it anyway. Standing there in the fiction section, you read seventeen pages of a book you didn't mean to buy, and your face kept changing like weather. And I thought: whoever you are, I'm going to love you. It's going to hurt. It's going to be worth it.\n\nThat was a Tuesday. Today is Sunday. Between then and now, you've taught me things I didn't know I didn't know. Like: my hands were always too empty before they held yours. Like: silence sounds different when you're in it. Like: I'd been pronouncing my own name wrong until you said it.\n\nI'm not good at this, Leyi. Other men would buy you flowers. I buy you the specific brand of yogurt you pretend not to be obsessed with. Other men would write you poetry. I write your name in the steam on the bathroom mirror and feel like I've invented language.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I'm difficult. I leave cabinets open. I can't sleep if the sheets aren't facing the right way. I've read all your books when you weren't looking, even the ones you hide. I practice arguments in the shower\u2014both sides. I'm terrified of your mother. I'm terrified of losing you. I'm terrified of how much I'm not terrified of anything else anymore.\n\nBut also this: I will never lie to you, not even kindly. I will learn the names of all your former pets and why each one mattered. I will hold your bad days as carefully as your good ones. I will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM and all the threes in between. I will love you past making sense.\n\nLast week, you fell asleep reading. The book fell on your face. You woke up with print on your cheek\u2014backwards words I couldn't read. But I touched each letter like they were instructions for keeping you. Like your skin was trying to tell me something important in reverse.\n\nThis is the something: Marry me.\n\nNot because we're ready. We're not. My mother thinks you're too good for me. Your father hasn't forgiven me for the Christmas incident. We disagree about money, about children, about whether ghosts are real. (They are. You're wrong about this.)\n\nMarry me because when you laugh\u2014really laugh\u2014dogs three blocks away start howling. Because you eat cereal for dinner when you're sad. Because you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about insurance and you still let me touch you. Because \"let\" is the wrong word. Because you reach for me in your sleep like I'm the only solid thing in a liquid world.\n\nMarry me because I already married you. In the grocery store when you couldn't reach the rice. In the hospital when they said it was nothing but we both knew it was something. In your sleep when you said my name like it was yours. Every day, in small places, I marry you again.\n\nI don't have much, Leyi. But I have this: a complete inability to imagine tomorrow without you in it. Call it love. Call it mental illness. Call it Tuesday. I don't care what you call it as long as you call it yours.\n\nThere's a ring in my sock drawer. It's been there since June. Sometimes I take it out and practice putting it on your finger while you're sleeping. I always chicken out. I'm not chickening out anymore.\n\nIt's simple: you're the first thing I want to tell good news. You're the only person I trust with the bad. When I die\u2014in seventy years, in seventeen minutes\u2014your name will be the last word that makes sense in my mouth.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because I've been holding my breath since that Tuesday in the bookstore, and I'm starting to turn colors that don't have names.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.
