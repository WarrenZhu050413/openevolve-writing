My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork. The kind that makes existing feel less like accident and more like purpose.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me.\n\nI'm asking you to let me keep loving you.\n\nThere's a difference.\n\nBoth are true.\n\nBoth are everything.\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before either of us knew what yours meant)\n\n*\n\nP.S.

This is the forty-third draft. The others are ash.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Sixteen seconds dead, sophomore year. No light, no tunnel. Just deletion. But in that nothing\u2014before thought, before I remembered having a name\u2014there was this pull. Like debt written in atoms. Three years later you walked into that bookstore. The debt was you.\n\n*\n\nSince then I've been taking evidence:\n\nYour breathing: 11-13 per minute awake, 9-11 asleep.\nYour left eye: always tears first.\nThe scar on your ankle: seventeen millimeters, from the bike at eight years old.\nHow you hold pencils: wrong, between middle and ring finger.\nYour coffee: 167 degrees exactly or you wait.\n\nThis isn't love. It's surveillance. I'm building a backup of you in case the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nTuesday you sang to our dying plant. It lived another week. Wednesday you argued with Siri for twenty minutes about the pronunciation of \"foyer.\" Thursday you cried at a video of elderly dogs. I documented everything. I'm not romantic. I'm terrified. Every time you leave a room I practice never seeing you again.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about why I count: After death, numbers were all I trusted. Sixteen seconds gone. Three years until you. Eleven months before I said your name right. Four sugars in your tea when you're sad. Two in coffee when you're not. Seven times you've slept with your hand on my chest like checking I'm still here.\n\nNumbers don't lie. You're here. Still here. Impossibly here.\n\n*\n\nBut listen\u2014I love you wrong. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb. With neurons that refuse to accept absence. Yesterday I called a door \"the wooden hole.\" My brain is rejecting language that doesn't include you. The doctor says it's stress. I say it's accuracy. Everything is just the space between you leaving and returning.\n\n*\n\nYou've asked for truth, so here: I've already attended your funeral 1,847 times. Different causes. The mundane ones hurt most\u2014choking on takeout, slipping in rain, forgetting to wake up. In the worst version I give a beautiful eulogy. In the honest version I don't survive the drive home.\n\nThen morning comes and you're still here, stealing my socks, mispronouncing \"specifically,\" existing at me so aggressively that atoms rearrange themselves to accommodate you.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's Wednesdays. Because I've been carrying your ring for 1,100 days through seven airports, three funerals, and one surgery. It's become an organ. Removing it would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee damage and the same favorite terrible song.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where you don't leave hair ties on my gear shift, where I don't know you're afraid of butterflies, where Chinese food doesn't disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, in the ice cream you'll eat at 11:17 tonight when you can't sleep. You hate cold fingers but you'll put it on anyway just to warm it up. That's when you'll know I've been planning this since you cried at penguins on our third date. Not because they were sad. Because they were \"too dressed up for the occasion.\" That's when my atoms recognized their assignment.\n\n*\n\nI don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love songs. They love weather. What I have needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between prayer and criminal confession.\n\n*\n\nYour left eye is crying. Right one starts in three seconds. Here\u2014I brought tissues. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting. \n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who wrote \"someone out there is going to ruin me\" on March 15th, 2019, and the universe started building you)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: High-Performer)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7320, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:17 AM with your hair tie around my wrist. You left it Tuesday. I've been wearing it like a tourniquet for whatever's hemorrhaging inside me.\n\n*\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been keeping receipts. Not metaphorically. Actually keeping them. Coffee, February 9th, $7.23. Thai food, March 15th, $34.89. That bookstore where we met, June 1st, $0.00\u2014because you insisted on buying the book we both reached for. I have 1,847 receipts in a shoebox. This isn't love. It's evidence for a crime I'm about to commit: asking you to marry someone who saves trash because it proves you were real.\n\n*\n\nI died once. Fourteen seconds. Training accident, never told you. Want to know what death taught me? Nothing profound. Just this: the last thing I thought wasn't about God or meaning. It was: \"I never learned her middle name.\" Then they brought me back, and the first thing I did was look you up. It's Marie. Leyi Marie. I say it sometimes when you're sleeping, like a prayer to keep you existing.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I've forgotten how to sleep without checking your pulse. Not romantically\u2014literally pressing two fingers to your neck at 2 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM. You caught me once. Said \"what are you doing?\" I said \"making sure.\" You said \"of what?\" I couldn't say: \"that the universe hasn't noticed what it gave me and taken it back.\"\n\n*\n\nTuesday, you cried at a video of penguins. Not sad crying\u2014joy crying. Your left eye first (always left). I filmed you secretly. Not the penguins. You. Your face doing that thing where happiness breaks through like light under a door. I watch it when you travel. Seventeen times last trip. My phone thinks I'm insane. My phone is correct.\n\n*\n\nWant more truth? I practice your eulogy. Different versions. Car accident: \"She sang off-key to every song and I would give my hearing to hear it again.\" Cancer: \"She fought like she argued\u2014irrationally, magnificently, until the universe gave up first.\" Old age: \"We had 19,847 mornings and I remember every coffee order.\" This is mental illness. Also preparation. Also love.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I love you at 6 PM on Wednesdays. In your fury at automatic sinks that don't sense your hands. In how you eat hamburgers (all toppings fall out, every time, you never learn). In your mother saying I'm \"interesting\" which means \"disappointing.\" In the way you'll look at fifty-three\u2014I can see it already when you squint at menus, those lines forming like maps to our future.\n\n*\n\nRemember the almost-accident? Interstate 90, that semi ran the red. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I saw death coming and my only thought was: \"not her, rearrange physics, take me twice.\" We missed by inches. You never knew. Kept singing. I pulled over to vomit from relief. You rubbed my back, thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n*\n\nHere's the ugliest part: I'm not good enough for you. I know this. You know this. The barista knows this. But here's what they don't know: I love you like a dog. Not poetically\u2014literally. With the same desperate gratitude, the same terror of abandonment, the same belief that you're the best thing that ever happened to mammals. I would sleep by your door. I would learn any trick. I would forget my own name if you'd just keep coming home.\n\n*\n\nThe biological facts: My circadian rhythm synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes your cells as self (I had this tested\u2014the lab thought I was joking). My left ventricle literally changed shape. The cardiologist said \"love doesn't do this.\" I said \"then what's your diagnosis?\" He had none.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived 1,297 days including that Tuesday you thought I was cheating but I was actually learning to make your grandmother's soup (still can't\u2014the woman took secrets to her grave). Because in infinite universes, only this one has us both conscious, concurrent, and arguing about the thermostat.\n\n*\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where you don't leave hair ties, where I don't save receipts, where your leftover pad thai doesn't disappear at 2 AM\u2014that's not a life. That's just time happening to someone else's body.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in your coffee mug. The chipped one you refuse to throw away because \"damaged things need more love, not less.\" I've been carrying it for two years. Some days it's all that keeps my pants up. Today it's all that's keeping me breathing.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an organ loves blood\u2014desperately, constantly, without any ability to do otherwise. The surgery to remove you would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a surgeon. She said \"that's not how bodies work.\" I said \"mine does.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nJust that.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe word that ruined all other words. That made my mouth finally make sense.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say it soon.\n\nMy cells are reorganizing, waiting.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. \u2014 You're crying now. Both eyes this time. I can hear you from the bedroom where I'm pretending to sleep but actually listening to you exist. Come here. Bring the ring. Bring your tears. Bring your righteous fury that I hid this from you. Bring your laugh that rearranges matter. Bring your yes. Please bring your yes.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That receipt from the bookstore? Turn it over. I wrote something that day: \"Just met the reason I'll never sleep properly again.\" I meant it romantically then. I mean it literally now. Your breathing is the metronome of my consciousness. Without it, I'm just noise.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name isn't Marie. It's Lynn. But you smiled when I was wrong, and that smile is why I save receipts\u2014to prove moments like that happened, when you loved me despite my failures, which is the only kind of love that matters.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6215, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:17 AM. Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since Tuesday when you said you needed this letter.\n\nThe truth? I don't know how to write this. I've started nineteen times. This is the twentieth. My hands are shaking and I keep deleting sentences because they sound like someone trying to sound like they're in love instead of just... being in love.\n\nSo here's what's true:\n\nWhen I was seven, my grandfather died. I remember asking my mother why she was crying so much, and she said: \"When you love someone for a long time, they become part of your body. When they leave, it's not grief\u2014it's phantom limb syndrome.\" I didn't understand then. I do now. You're already in my nervous system. If you left, I'd keep reaching for you. Muscle memory doesn't forget.\n\nI'm scared of almost everything. Seriously. Scared of cancer, car accidents, plane crashes, food poisoning, identity theft, climate change, brain aneurysms. But mostly I'm scared that one morning I'll wake up and you'll be sixty-three and I'll be sixty-five and we'll have spent our whole lives being careful instead of being honest. So here's honest:\n\nI talk to you when you're not here. Full conversations. Both sides. You usually win the arguments.\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and have to leave the room because the feeling is too big. It's like trying to hold the ocean in my chest. I go to the bathroom and sit on the floor and just breathe until I can come back to bed without waking you up with how much I love you.\n\nI know this sounds crazy but: I loved you before we met. There's no other explanation for why I saved that empty seat next to me for twenty-nine years. Not consciously. But every woman I dated, I was comparing to someone who didn't exist yet. Then you walked in and my body said: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nThe worst part about loving you? It made me ordinary. I used to think I was special, complicated, interesting. Then you happened and suddenly I'm just another person destroyed by love, saying the same things everyone says: \"I can't live without you.\" \"You complete me.\" \"You're everything.\" These clich\u00e9s used to make me laugh. Now they make me cry because I understand why millions of people couldn't find better words. There aren't any.\n\nBut also the small things: You eat pizza with a fork. You cry at commercials with dogs. You think 2+2=5 when you're tired. You hum when you're nervous. You can't sleep without your left foot outside the blanket. You pretend you don't like my terrible puns but you smile\u2014just a little\u2014before you groan.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for seven months. Not because I was waiting for the perfect moment but because I was scared you'd realize you could do better. You can, by the way. Do better. But please don't.\n\nHere's what I promise: I'll love you wrong. I'll love you too much. I'll embarrass us at parties with how I look at you. I'll forget important dates but remember that you hate wool sweaters. I'll mess up. Daily. But I'll show up. Also daily.\n\nI can't promise you the moon or stars or whatever people promise. But I can promise this: When you can't sleep, I'll tell you boring stories about my day until you drift off. When you're sad, I'll make terrible jokes until you laugh despite yourself. When you're happy, I'll be happy just watching you be happy. When we're old, I'll still see you exactly as you are right now, Tuesday afternoon, reading this letter with your coffee getting cold.\n\nMarry me. Not because of this letter. Marry me because you already know my answer when you ask \"what do you want for dinner?\" (Whatever you want.) Marry me because we've been practicing being married for three years. Marry me because the other day you referred to my mother as \"mom\" without thinking about it and she cried.\n\nMarry me because I can't write poetry but I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve you anyway.\n\nLeyi, I don't have beautiful words. I just have this: \n\nYou're my person. The one I want to tell everything to. The one I want next to me when the test results come back. The one I want to argue with about thermostats and loading the dishwasher correctly. The one I want to watch get old.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Either way, I'm already yours.\n\nBut say yes.\n\nPlease.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with borrowed time\u20143:51 AM, the hour when truth becomes involuntary.\n\n*\n\nHere's what they don't tell you: I've been dead.

Three years later, you walked in. The promise was you.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? I've been building an archive. Evidence of us:\n\nEntry #1: You, eating soup in winter. The steam making small prayers above the bowl. I thought: this is how religions begin.\n\nEntry #847: Your hand on my chest while sleeping. I held my breath for three minutes rather than disturb that specific pressure holding the universe together.\n\nEntry #1,973: Today. You, reading this.

Statistical probability says you'll die first\u201473.6% chance. I've punched walls over this number. But here's what the math doesn't know: I've been practicing dying since we met. Every night, small rehearsals. By the time it happens, I'll be so good at being dead, I'll go first just to spite the statistics.\n\n*\n\nThe accident we almost had\u2014Interstate 90, you were singing off-key, I saw the truck jackknifing and thought: take me, rearrange physics, I'll pay any price. We missed by inches. You never knew. You kept singing. That song you always get wrong. I pulled over later to vomit from relief. You thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you has done: I'm medically different. My sleep synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes you as self. My DNA has literally rewritten sections\u2014I had it tested. The doctor said \"that's impossible.\" I said \"I know.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I love you like a pathology. Like a chronic condition. I've stolen things\u2014your pencil with teeth marks, three bobby pins, a voicemail where you're crying. These are my insurance against forgetting. Meanwhile, you've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you don't exist, furious about the dishwasher.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our mundane apocalypses. In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy). In the way you'll look at seventy-three, squinting at screens, those lines I already want to trace.\n\n*\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because the alternative\u2014a universe where your toothbrush doesn't live here, where I don't know you need exactly four ice cubes, where you don't steal my socks\u2014isn't a universe. It's just atoms arranged wrongly.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about pasta.\n\nMarry me because I've been carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at jellyfish, said they looked lonely\u2014that's when I knew I'd love you wrong forever).\n\n*\n\nBut mostly: marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday you mispronounced my name and my brain thought: \"Oh. There's the person who's going to ruin me for everyone else.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is hidden where you'll find it\u2014in your coffee mug, the one with the chip, because you believe broken things deserve more love, not less.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I don't love you. Love is too small, a word people use for pizza. What I have needs a new language\u2014something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper pennies. Something that makes the word \"forever\" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: my atoms have already chosen.
