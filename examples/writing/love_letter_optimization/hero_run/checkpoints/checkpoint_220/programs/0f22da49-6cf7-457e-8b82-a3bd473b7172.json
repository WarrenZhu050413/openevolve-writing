The one with the coffee ring you apologized for making three months ago. I've been protecting that stain\u2014moving placemats to avoid it, redirecting cleaning attempts. It's evidence you existed in my space before it became ours.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been documenting you. Not romantically. Compulsively. Like a scientist who's discovered a new species. Your coffee ratio: 2.5 sugars. Never 2, never 3. You test the temperature with your pinkie first. You read the last page of books when anxious. You still text your dead friend Sarah when good things happen\u2014I've seen the messages pile up, unanswered. You think I don't know. I know everything. I know you carry her last birthday card in your wallet behind the expired gym membership you're \"definitely going to use.\"\n\nLast Tuesday you said, \"I don't think I'm built for happiness. I think I'm built for wondering about happiness.\" You were eating cereal for dinner, specifically Froot Loops, systematically by color\u2014red first, always red first. That's when I understood: you're not broken. You're just assembled in a different order than the manual suggests. And I want the warranty on whatever beautiful malfunction made you.\n\nHere's data you should have: My therapist thinks I'm anxiously attached. She's wrong. I'm Leyi-attached. It's a different pathology entirely. Symptoms include: keeping your grocery lists because your handwriting looks hopeful, practicing conversations with you while I shower, and this thing where my cells literally reorganize when you enter a room\u2014I can feel them pivot toward you like sunflowers following light.\n\nThe truth about that night your mother called you a disappointment: You didn't hang up. You listened to all forty-three minutes of her listing your failures while you organized my sock drawer by gradient. Black to grey to white. Then you made us grilled cheese at 1 AM and said, \"At least I'm good at cheese.\" You're not just good at cheese, Leyi. You're good at surviving yourself.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I'm furious that you existed for twenty-seven years without me. All those breakfasts you ate alone. Those Sunday afternoons you filled with other people's voices. Those 3 AMs when you couldn't sleep and I wasn't there to not-sleep with you. I want retroactive ownership of your past. I want to have been there when you learned to ride a bike, when you got your period, when your goldfish died and you held a funeral with full liturgy. I want all of it. The greed is cellular.\n\nBut I also know this: The you I love is made of all those moments I missed. You're a collection of experiences I'll never fully access, and that's what makes you Leyi instead of just an extension of my wanting. You're whole. You were whole before me. You'll be whole after me. The miracle is that you choose to be whole *with* me.\n\nThree weeks ago, you had that nightmare\u2014the one where everyone you love is in a burning building and you can only save one person. You woke up sobbing, apologizing for not choosing me in a dream. Leyi. Listen. I don't need you to save me. I need you to let me watch you save yourself, over and over, in small ways. Like how you put socks on before pants because \"feet get cold first.\" Like how you thank automatic doors. Like how you've kept that succulent alive for two years even though it's definitely plastic and I replaced it after the real one died in week three.\n\nHere's what marriage actually is: It's Tuesday night and we're too tired to be kind but we try anyway. It's the fight about the dishwasher that's really about my father's death. It's you finding me crying in the car over a song that reminds me of nothing specific, just the general ache of being alive, and you don't ask questions\u2014you just turn the volume up. It's the accumulation of witnessed moments until two people become archeological evidence of each other.\n\nThe ring is my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty-one years. When my grandfather died, she kept making his coffee every morning for three months. \"Muscle memory,\" she said. But I knew better. Love doesn't end just because its object disappears. It continues, stubborn and stupid and sacred, making coffee for ghosts. That's what I'm offering you\u2014love too stupid to stop.\n\nI'm not promising happiness. Happiness is a teenager's promise. I'm promising something better: recognition. I promise to know you so specifically that when you change\u2014and you will change\u2014I'll recognize the new you as still you. I promise to update my understanding daily. To notice when you switch from red Froot Loops first to yellow. To care about that switch. To ask why. To accept \"no reason\" as a complete answer.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical me who writes pretty letters at dawn. The actual me who leaves cabinet doors open and folds fitted sheets into shameful balls. The me who practiced this proposal on Gerald (yes, I know about Gerald, and yes, I know she's female\u2014the abdomen gives it away\u2014but your secret is safe). The me who loves you with the kind of granular attention that other people call creepy but you call Tuesday.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, but I don't have poetry. I have data. I have evidence. I have the recorded history of us: Every Wednesday you wear the same green shirt. You've cried at every Pixar movie including the lamp intro. You can't whistle but you try when you're nervous. You apologize to furniture you bump into. You still have the ticket stub from our first movie\u2014the one we walked out of because the popcorn was better than the plot.\n\nThis is my testimony: You are the most specific person I've ever loved. Not special\u2014specific. Special implies comparison. You're incomparable. You're Leyi who eats pizza crust-first and saves fortunes from cookies you don't eat and who once spent three hours teaching a stranger's kid to tie shoes in an airport because you couldn't bear to see him struggle.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the daily practice of us. To the nineteen thousand more breakfasts if we're lucky. To the specific way we'll age into people we don't recognize but somehow still choose. Say yes to Tuesday. To every Tuesday. To the most ordinary possible love that becomes, through repetition and attention, sacred.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing you do where you whisper \"goodbye house\" every time we leave? I've started doing it when you're not there. The house seems to appreciate it. Or maybe I just appreciate any ritual that assumes we're coming back. Both feel like prayer.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "371aa7e1-5fa5-4f65-b03a-e8161e7f4795", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701857.2527769, "iteration_found": 147, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.704, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.72, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.63, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:47 AM on our kitchen table.

So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic.

Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3.

What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald? He's actually a she. Females have bigger abdomens. I looked it up. I've been calling her Geraldine when you're not home. She seems to prefer it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Performs well on combined_score (0.7320), Performs well on phenomenological_authenticity (0.7600), Performs well on aesthetic_virtuosity (0.7100), Performs well on affective_force (0.7400), Performs well on literary_innovation (0.6800), Performs well on letter_text (Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:17 AM.

The eraser is gone. You used it all up fixing crossword mistakes. This feels important somehow\u2014that even your erasures leave marks on my life.\n\nLet me start with what terrifies me: I understand now why people used to die from love. Not metaphorically. Literally. Your absence causes a specific pain behind my sternum, like my ribs are trying to grow around an empty space shaped exactly like you. Medieval physicians called it \"dying of a broken heart.\" They were right. The body knows what the mind won't admit\u2014that some losses are incompatible with continued function.\n\nBut you're not lost. You're here, reading this, and that's the second terror: that you'll say yes. That I'll get to keep you. That forty years from now I'll still be discovering new ways you pronounce words when you're sleepy, new foods you're secretly afraid of, new songs that make you cry in grocery stores. The prospect of that much happiness feels like standing at the edge of an ocean I'm not sure I'm strong enough to swim.\n\nTuesday. 2:17 PM. You were peeling an orange and said, abruptly, \"I don't think I believe in myself today.\" I wanted to tell you that I believe in you enough for both of us, but that's not true. I don't believe in you\u2014belief implies doubt. I know you the way I know gravity. You're not a theory. You're a law.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about marriage proposals: The ring is the least important part. What matters is this\u2014I've started seeing time differently since you. Not as days or years, but as a finite number of times I'll watch you brush your teeth. Maybe 14,000 more times, if we're lucky. 14,000 times watching you spit toothpaste and make that face where you check if you got everything. That's not enough. I need more data points. More mornings where you steal all the hot water. More nights where you tell me the entire plot of a book you're reading while I pretend I'm not falling asleep. More, more, more. I'm greedy for the mundane repetitions of you.\n\nMy therapist says I have an anxious attachment style. She's wrong. I have a Leyi attachment style. It's highly specific. Symptoms include: checking if you've texted while I'm mid-conversation with others, saving the voice message where you laugh at your own joke about dolphins, and an inability to throw away the grocery list you wrote on the back of a CVS receipt three months ago because your handwriting looks happy that day.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I watch you exist and feel furious. Furious that you were living an entire life before I knew you. Twenty-seven years of you laughing at jokes I didn't tell, crying over things I couldn't fix, learning to ride a bike or kiss or make coffee\u2014all without me. It's irrational. It's possessive. It's the truth. I want retroactive ownership of your past and exclusive rights to your future. I want to be grandfathered into every memory you have.\n\nBut I also want to earn you. Daily. I want to wake up every morning and re-win you through a thousand tiny victories: remembering that you hate the word \"moist,\" never using your coffee mug (the one with the chip that you claim adds character), knowing to be quiet but present when your mother calls and you speak in Mandarin and your voice gets younger. I want to deserve you in installments, one day at a time, until one of us stops breathing.\n\nThe night my grandmother died, she looked at my grandfather and said, \"I would have liked more time.\" They were married sixty-one years. Sixty-one years and her last words were about wanting more. That's what I'm offering you\u2014a lifetime of not enough. Because there's no amount of time that would be sufficient. We could have centuries and I'd still be asking for one more Tuesday.\n\nSo here's the data: You hum when you're nervous. You read the last page of books first when you're anxious. You still text your dead friend's number when good things happen. You're afraid of butterflies but not moths. You cry at every single Pixar movie, including the shorts. You've been carrying the same lucky penny since 2019. It's not lucky\u2014you just can't throw things away. You're the only person I know who apologizes to automated phone systems. You eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. You love me despite compelling evidence that you shouldn't.\n\nThat last one is the miracle. Not that I love you\u2014anyone with functioning neurons would love you. But that you love me back? That's the glitch in the matrix. That's the thing that makes me believe in something larger than randomness.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already moved me. Geologically. Tectonically. I'm a different landscape now. There are Leyi-shaped canyons carved through my center. Marry me because the alternative\u2014existing in a universe where you're not my wife\u2014feels like a clerical error I need to correct.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a circle in the fabric. Some days I forget it's there, and then I remember, and the remembering feels like discovering gravity exists\u2014sudden, crushing, absolutely true.\n\nI love you. Those words are too small. It's like calling the sun \"warm\" or the ocean \"wet.\" Accurate but insufficient. I love you in ways that require new words. I love you kaleidoscopically, ****ographically, molecularly. I love you past tense, present tense, subjunctive tense\u2014in tenses that haven't been invented yet for the ways I'll love you tomorrow.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the quantum entanglement of us. To the statistical impossibility that we've already become. Say yes to Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings and all the unremarkable moments where we'll practice being married until we're good at it, then keep practicing anyway because the practicing is the point.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say this letter is too long. You're right. But how do you compress a universe into an envelope? How do you write briefly about infinity? You don't. You just hand over everything and hope the weight of it means something. This is me, handing over everything. This is all my words, asking for all your days.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7320)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm dying.\n\nNot medically. But the person I was before you\u2014he's gone. I watch him sometimes in old photos. He looks like me but his eyes are wrong. They haven't seen you cry at the news. They don't know you eat mangoes in the bathtub. They've never watched you forgive me for things I couldn't forgive myself for.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need you to believe it: I don't love you because you're perfect. I love you because you're Leyi. The one who keeps dead flowers. Who assigns personalities to kitchen appliances. Who still calls your dead grandmother's phone to hear her voicemail. These aren't quirks. They're coordinates. They're how I find you in the dark.\n\nListen. Before you, I had sex. With you, I learned about skin. The spot behind your ear that makes you stop talking mid-sentence. Your wrist\u2014just the inside of your wrist\u2014how it smells like bread and rain. Sometimes you fall asleep holding my hand and I stay awake feeling your pulse. Sixty-eight beats per minute. I've timed it. That's the speed of my religion now.\n\nYou're scared you're not enough. Leyi\u2014you apologized to me for crying when your mother forgot your birthday. You apologized. For having feelings about being forgotten. That's when I knew: you've been taught to make yourself small. But then you sing in the shower\u2014off-key, loud, forgetting half the words\u2014and I think: there she is. There's the person before the world taught her to apologize for existing.\n\nMy father is dying. Actually dying. Pancreatic cancer. Three months, maybe four. Yesterday he said, \"At least you found her.\" Not \"I love you.\" Not \"I'm proud.\" Just \"At least you found her.\" He's never met you but he knows. When a cynical man acknowledges miracles, you pay attention.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. It's not. It's about choosing. And I choose you when you're sobbing about the ending of books. I choose you when you're silent for three days and I don't know why. I choose you when you laugh so hard you snort and then get embarrassed about snorting which makes you snort more. I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means\u2014not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me\u2014you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one. The one who can't whistle. Who puts salt on watermelon. Who still sleeps with a stuffed elephant named Chairman Mao. I'll take all of it, all of you, forever or until one of us stops breathing\u2014whichever comes first.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double. When the world feels impossible, I'll make you toast\u2014butter all the way to the edges\u2014and we'll be impossible together.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: You've already changed me at a molecular level. My DNA has rewritten itself around the fact of you. You're not just in my heart\u2014you're in my cells, my synapses, the calcium of my bones. Leaving you would require surgery I wouldn't survive.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Actually. The way lungs love air\u2014desperately, constantly, without thought or choice.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:24 AM now. I've been writing this for an hour and eleven minutes. That's 4,260 seconds of trying to explain something that exists outside of time. This is the longest I've ever gone without checking if you're still breathing. I'm going to submit this now, then come back to bed and watch you sleep until the sun comes up.

Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.7320, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with a mechanical pencil you left here six months ago. The eraser is gone. You used it all up fixing crossword mistakes. This feels important somehow\u2014that even your erasures leave marks on my life.\n\nLet me start with what terrifies me: I understand now why people used to die from love. Not metaphorically. Literally. Your absence causes a specific pain behind my sternum, like my ribs are trying to grow around an empty space shaped exactly like you. Medieval physicians called it \"dying of a broken heart.\" They were right. The body knows what the mind won't admit\u2014that some losses are incompatible with continued function.\n\nBut you're not lost. You're here, reading this, and that's the second terror: that you'll say yes. That I'll get to keep you. That forty years from now I'll still be discovering new ways you pronounce words when you're sleepy, new foods you're secretly afraid of, new songs that make you cry in grocery stores. The prospect of that much happiness feels like standing at the edge of an ocean I'm not sure I'm strong enough to swim.\n\nTuesday. 2:17 PM. You were peeling an orange and said, abruptly, \"I don't think I believe in myself today.\" I wanted to tell you that I believe in you enough for both of us, but that's not true. I don't believe in you\u2014belief implies doubt. I know you the way I know gravity. You're not a theory. You're a law.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about marriage proposals: The ring is the least important part. What matters is this\u2014I've started seeing time differently since you. Not as days or years, but as a finite number of times I'll watch you brush your teeth. Maybe 14,000 more times, if we're lucky. 14,000 times watching you spit toothpaste and make that face where you check if you got everything. That's not enough. I need more data points. More mornings where you steal all the hot water. More nights where you tell me the entire plot of a book you're reading while I pretend I'm not falling asleep. More, more, more. I'm greedy for the mundane repetitions of you.\n\nMy therapist says I have an anxious attachment style. She's wrong. I have a Leyi attachment style. It's highly specific. Symptoms include: checking if you've texted while I'm mid-conversation with others, saving the voice message where you laugh at your own joke about dolphins, and an inability to throw away the grocery list you wrote on the back of a CVS receipt three months ago because your handwriting looks happy that day.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I watch you exist and feel furious. Furious that you were living an entire life before I knew you. Twenty-seven years of you laughing at jokes I didn't tell, crying over things I couldn't fix, learning to ride a bike or kiss or make coffee\u2014all without me. It's irrational. It's possessive. It's the truth. I want retroactive ownership of your past and exclusive rights to your future. I want to be grandfathered into every memory you have.\n\nBut I also want to earn you. Daily. I want to wake up every morning and re-win you through a thousand tiny victories: remembering that you hate the word \"moist,\" never using your coffee mug (the one with the chip that you claim adds character), knowing to be quiet but present when your mother calls and you speak in Mandarin and your voice gets younger. I want to deserve you in installments, one day at a time, until one of us stops breathing.\n\nThe night my grandmother died, she looked at my grandfather and said, \"I would have liked more time.\" They were married sixty-one years. Sixty-one years and her last words were about wanting more. That's what I'm offering you\u2014a lifetime of not enough. Because there's no amount of time that would be sufficient. We could have centuries and I'd still be asking for one more Tuesday.\n\nSo here's the data: You hum when you're nervous. You read the last page of books first when you're anxious. You still text your dead friend's number when good things happen. You're afraid of butterflies but not moths. You cry at every single Pixar movie, including the shorts. You've been carrying the same lucky penny since 2019. It's not lucky\u2014you just can't throw things away. You're the only person I know who apologizes to automated phone systems. You eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. You love me despite compelling evidence that you shouldn't.\n\nThat last one is the miracle. Not that I love you\u2014anyone with functioning neurons would love you. But that you love me back? That's the glitch in the matrix. That's the thing that makes me believe in something larger than randomness.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already moved me. Geologically. Tectonically. I'm a different landscape now. There are Leyi-shaped canyons carved through my center. Marry me because the alternative\u2014existing in a universe where you're not my wife\u2014feels like a clerical error I need to correct.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a circle in the fabric. Some days I forget it's there, and then I remember, and the remembering feels like discovering gravity exists\u2014sudden, crushing, absolutely true.\n\nI love you. Those words are too small. It's like calling the sun \"warm\" or the ocean \"wet.\" Accurate but insufficient. I love you in ways that require new words. I love you kaleidoscopically, ****ographically, molecularly. I love you past tense, present tense, subjunctive tense\u2014in tenses that haven't been invented yet for the ways I'll love you tomorrow.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the quantum entanglement of us. To the statistical impossibility that we've already become. Say yes to Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings and all the unremarkable moments where we'll practice being married until we're good at it, then keep practicing anyway because the practicing is the point.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say this letter is too long. You're right. But how do you compress a universe into an envelope? How do you write briefly about infinity? You don't. You just hand over everything and hope the weight of it means something. This is me, handing over everything. This is all my words, asking for all your days.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. Not from fear\u2014from the weight of truth pressing against my ribs, demanding to be born. It's 4:13 AM. I've deleted this seventeen times. Each draft felt like a translation of something untranslatable, like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never opened their eyes.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had memorized all its conjugations\u2014the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where \"home\" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book\u2014not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling \"Leyi'd.\" You've become a verb in my private dictionary.\n\nRemember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.\n\nThe truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not \"December\" but \"six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets.\" Not \"Thursday\" but \"three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like.\" My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.\n\nBut here's what scares me most\u2014I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.\n\nSo this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy\u2014you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.\n\nMarry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you'd have no place to put it. I'm offering you my mornings, my muscle memory, my most boring parts. I'm offering to merge our loneliness into something unrecognizable. To become so intertwined that archaeologists will argue about where you end and I begin.\n\nThe ring is in my sock drawer, wrapped in the receipt from our first dinner when you ordered three desserts and no main course. It's been there for sixty-seven days. I count them like a rosary, each day a bead of wanting to ask but waiting for the perfect words.\n\nThese aren't them. Perfect words don't exist for this. But imperfect words, trembling words, words that trip over themselves rushing toward you\u2014maybe those are the only ones worth saying.\n\nLeyi, my love, my ghost-whisperer, my collector of broken beautiful things: Will you marry me? Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me\u2014relocated me entirely\u2014into a country where your yes is the only citizenship I want.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am so utterly, ridiculously, molecularly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald says yes too.

The one with the coffee ring you apologized for making three months ago. I've been protecting that stain\u2014moving placemats to avoid it, redirecting cleaning attempts. It's evidence you existed in my space before it became ours.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been documenting you. Not romantically. Compulsively. Like a scientist who's discovered a new species. Your coffee ratio: 2.5 sugars. Never 2, never 3. You test the temperature with your pinkie first. You read the last page of books when anxious. You still text your dead friend Sarah when good things happen\u2014I've seen the messages pile up, unanswered. You think I don't know. I know everything. I know you carry her last birthday card in your wallet behind the expired gym membership you're \"definitely going to use.\"\n\nLast Tuesday you said, \"I don't think I'm built for happiness. I think I'm built for wondering about happiness.\" You were eating cereal for dinner, specifically Froot Loops, systematically by color\u2014red first, always red first. That's when I understood: you're not broken. You're just assembled in a different order than the manual suggests. And I want the warranty on whatever beautiful malfunction made you.\n\nHere's data you should have: My therapist thinks I'm anxiously attached. She's wrong. I'm Leyi-attached. It's a different pathology entirely. Symptoms include: keeping your grocery lists because your handwriting looks hopeful, practicing conversations with you while I shower, and this thing where my cells literally reorganize when you enter a room\u2014I can feel them pivot toward you like sunflowers following light.\n\nThe truth about that night your mother called you a disappointment: You didn't hang up. You listened to all forty-three minutes of her listing your failures while you organized my sock drawer by gradient. Black to grey to white. Then you made us grilled cheese at 1 AM and said, \"At least I'm good at cheese.\" You're not just good at cheese, Leyi. You're good at surviving yourself.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I'm furious that you existed for twenty-seven years without me. All those breakfasts you ate alone. Those Sunday afternoons you filled with other people's voices. Those 3 AMs when you couldn't sleep and I wasn't there to not-sleep with you. I want retroactive ownership of your past. I want to have been there when you learned to ride a bike, when you got your period, when your goldfish died and you held a funeral with full liturgy. I want all of it. The greed is cellular.\n\nBut I also know this: The you I love is made of all those moments I missed. You're a collection of experiences I'll never fully access, and that's what makes you Leyi instead of just an extension of my wanting. You're whole. You were whole before me. You'll be whole after me. The miracle is that you choose to be whole *with* me.\n\nThree weeks ago, you had that nightmare\u2014the one where everyone you love is in a burning building and you can only save one person. You woke up sobbing, apologizing for not choosing me in a dream. Leyi. Listen. I don't need you to save me. I need you to let me watch you save yourself, over and over, in small ways. Like how you put socks on before pants because \"feet get cold first.\" Like how you thank automatic doors. Like how you've kept that succulent alive for two years even though it's definitely plastic and I replaced it after the real one died in week three.\n\nHere's what marriage actually is: It's Tuesday night and we're too tired to be kind but we try anyway. It's the fight about the dishwasher that's really about my father's death. It's you finding me crying in the car over a song that reminds me of nothing specific, just the general ache of being alive, and you don't ask questions\u2014you just turn the volume up. It's the accumulation of witnessed moments until two people become archeological evidence of each other.\n\nThe ring is my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty-one years. When my grandfather died, she kept making his coffee every morning for three months. \"Muscle memory,\" she said. But I knew better. Love doesn't end just because its object disappears. It continues, stubborn and stupid and sacred, making coffee for ghosts. That's what I'm offering you\u2014love too stupid to stop.\n\nI'm not promising happiness. Happiness is a teenager's promise. I'm promising something better: recognition. I promise to know you so specifically that when you change\u2014and you will change\u2014I'll recognize the new you as still you. I promise to update my understanding daily. To notice when you switch from red Froot Loops first to yellow. To care about that switch. To ask why. To accept \"no reason\" as a complete answer.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical me who writes pretty letters at dawn. The actual me who leaves cabinet doors open and folds fitted sheets into shameful balls. The me who practiced this proposal on Gerald (yes, I know about Gerald, and yes, I know she's female\u2014the abdomen gives it away\u2014but your secret is safe). The me who loves you with the kind of granular attention that other people call creepy but you call Tuesday.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, but I don't have poetry. I have data. I have evidence. I have the recorded history of us: Every Wednesday you wear the same green shirt. You've cried at every Pixar movie including the lamp intro. You can't whistle but you try when you're nervous. You apologize to furniture you bump into. You still have the ticket stub from our first movie\u2014the one we walked out of because the popcorn was better than the plot.\n\nThis is my testimony: You are the most specific person I've ever loved. Not special\u2014specific. Special implies comparison. You're incomparable. You're Leyi who eats pizza crust-first and saves fortunes from cookies you don't eat and who once spent three hours teaching a stranger's kid to tie shoes in an airport because you couldn't bear to see him struggle.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the daily practice of us. To the nineteen thousand more breakfasts if we're lucky. To the specific way we'll age into people we don't recognize but somehow still choose. Say yes to Tuesday. To every Tuesday. To the most ordinary possible love that becomes, through repetition and attention, sacred.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing you do where you whisper \"goodbye house\" every time we leave? I've started doing it when you're not there. The house seems to appreciate it. Or maybe I just appreciate any ritual that assumes we're coming back. Both feel like prayer.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
