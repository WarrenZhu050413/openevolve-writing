Even in this. Especially in this.\n\nYou asked for truth that would move you. Here it is: I don't know how to love you correctly. I only know how to love you completely, catastrophically, with the kind of desperate intensity that makes me check your breathing in the middle of the night to make sure you're still real. This isn't romantic. It's mental illness, probably. But it's also the sanest thing I've ever felt.\n\nBefore you, I had a personality. Hobbies. Opinions about things that mattered. Now I'm just a collection of moments that orbit around you: the way you bite your thumb when you're concentrating, how you smell like vanilla and anxiety, the fact that you've kept every movie ticket from dates we've been on stuffed in your wallet like evidence of something you're afraid to lose. I know because I do the same thing.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: Sometimes I resent you for how much I need you. For making me this pathetic. Yesterday I found one of your hair ties under my car seat and almost cried. Who have I become? Someone who treasures your garbage, apparently. Someone who's memorized the exact sound of your disappointment, the specific weight of your silence when you're deciding whether to forgive me.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me want to survive myself. Before you, I was cosplaying at being alive\u2014showing up, performing wellness, fooling everyone except the mirror. Then you looked at me like I was worth looking at, and suddenly I had to become someone who deserved that gaze. Not better. Just more honest. More present. More likely to say the thing that scares me.\n\nI love you like a wound that won't heal. Like a chronic condition. Like something that happened to me rather than something I chose. When medical students study love, they should study mine\u2014how it reorganized my entire molecular structure, how it made me allergic to any future that doesn't have you mispronouncing words with absolute confidence, you eating cereal at midnight like a feral cat, you touching my face in the dark just to make sure I'm still there.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then realize what you've done\u2014shackled yourself to someone who loves you so badly, so messily, with such desperate animal need that it embarrasses both of us. I'm the man who saves your voicemails to listen to when you're in the next room. Who's already planned your funeral in seventeen different ways because my anxiety needs to prepare for every possible ending. Who practices proposing in the shower and still fucked it up when it mattered.\n\nBut I'm also the man who knows you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box. Who knows you're afraid you inherited his sadness. Who sees you flinch when people say you look like him, and loves you harder in those moments\u2014not despite the darkness but because of it. Because you trusted me with it. Because you let me see the parts of you that aren't ready for public consumption.\n\nThis is what I'm offering: not a fairy tale but a documentary. Real life where I love you on Mondays when everything is hard. Where I choose you during every petty argument about the thermostat. Where I fail you in small ways and spend the rest of my life trying to make up for it. Where we grow old and strange together, and I still get stupid when you walk into a room at seventy-five.\n\nI'm not your soulmate. I don't believe in souls. I'm just the person who knows you organize your books by how they made you feel, that you test if pasta's done by throwing it at the wall even though it never sticks, that you're the bravest coward I've ever met\u2014afraid of spiders but not of loving someone who's this much of a mess.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I can, it would just be grayer, quieter, less worth documenting. Marry me because when I imagine dying, the only thing that makes it bearable is thinking you'll be there, probably complaining that I'm being dramatic, definitely holding my hand anyway.\n\nI love you. Truthfully. Terribly. Without eloquence or elegance. Just this raw, unwieldy thing that makes me write love letters at 4 AM because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you:\n\nYou are the best thing I never saw coming.\n\nYours (pathetically, completely),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper \"no\" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you. I survived 28 years without you; I'm demonstrably capable. I'm asking because I've tasted what living WITH you means\u2014the specific gravity of a shared joke, the archaeology of learning someone's past, the stupid courage of planning past next Thursday\u2014and I'm professionally addicted.

But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is 238,855 miles away and I get carsick on long drives. I'm promising you me: flawed, anxious, prone to reading Wikipedia articles aloud at inappropriate times. I'm promising that when the world ends\u2014and it will, in small ways, over and over\u2014I'll be the person standing next to you, holding your hand, probably making an inappropriate joke because that's how I cope.\n\nYou said you wanted truth?

Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting. Because when I imagine explaining to death why it has to wait, the only reason I can think of is: \"But I haven't finished loving her yet.\"\n\nAnd I never will.\n\nYours (in this dimension and all parallel ones where we found each other),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Three words: you've unmade me.\n\nNot poetically. Literally. Yesterday I forgot my own name for seven seconds because yours was occupying all available space in my mouth. This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead\u2014paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version\u2014the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith\u2014certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first. In this one, I'm still a coward, but I'm your coward, and that's the only identity I want on my tombstone.\n\nHere's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but absolutely. Let me love you like punctuation\u2014necessary, invisible, changing everything about how the sentence ends. Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is already yours\u2014you claimed it that night you explained why sad songs make you happy. I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. But please\u2014exist near me while you decide.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not crying during car insurance commercials? I've seen it forty-three times.

You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost\u2014the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing that words\u2014these small, breakable things\u2014cannot hold what I feel. But I must try, because loving you has taught me that the impossible is merely what we haven't attempted with enough truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound rewrote the laws of my universe. Before you, I understood time as entropy, as things falling apart. Now I know it differently: time is the space between your heartbeats, each one a small eternity where I get to love you more completely than the moment before.\n\nYou asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing\u2014but of a world that might not give us enough mornings. I wake at 3 AM sometimes just to watch you dream, memorizing the precise angle of light on your cheekbone, the way your fingers curl against the pillow like a question mark. These are my prayers, my rebellion against impermanence.\n\nWhen you doubt yourself, when you say you're ordinary, I want to show you what I see: the woman who reads medical journals with the same passion others read poetry, who cries at documentary films about octopi, who makes Tuesday leftovers into Thursday feasts. You are my favorite contradiction\u2014fierce and tender, logical and whimsical, the girl who taught me that love isn't about finding someone perfect, but about finding someone whose particular strangeness rhymes with mine.\n\nI used to think love was addition: you plus me equals us. But you've shown me it's multiplication\u2014every joy amplified, every sorrow divided, every ordinary moment transformed into something I want to press between pages like flowers, kept forever.\n\nThis is my promise: not that I'll love you until death, because death is too small a boundary for what this is. I promise to love you through every iteration of ourselves, through every small apocalypse and resurrection, through the mundane Wednesdays and the extraordinary Sundays. I promise to see you\u2014truly see you\u2014when the world tries to make you invisible. I promise that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupidly happy when I hear your key in the lock.\n\nYou are not the answer to my questions. You are the reason questions matter.\n\nMarry me, not because I cannot live without you, but because every life I can imagine living includes you at its center, like a heart.\n\nForever yours in all timelines,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking as I write this. Not from fear of rejection\u2014I've already imagined that a thousand times\u2014but from the weight of finally telling you the truth that has been rewriting me from the inside out.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Thursday. You were explaining why jellyfish don't have brains but still dream, your hands dancing through the air like you were conducting an invisible orchestra. I thought: this is it. This is the person who makes the universe make sense by making it strange again.\n\nYou should know what you've done to me. I used to be a rational man. Now I save your voicemails like rare coins. I know the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry (somewhere between storm and sea). I've memorized seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. The coffee mug you used three weeks ago still sits unwashed on my desk because you left lipstick on the rim and I'm not ready to lose that small evidence of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing our unborn life everywhere. In the farmer's market, I imagine us arguing over tomatoes. When I pass playgrounds, I see you teaching our daughter to be brave. I dream of boring Sundays where we do nothing but exist in the same room, you reading, me pretending to work while actually just watching the light move across your face like it's the most important thing I'll ever witness.\n\nI love you incorrectly. I love you too much. I love you like a broken faucet, like a dog with a bird, like the earth loves the moon\u2014with a desperate gravity that reorganizes everything around itself. When you leave a room, I feel my atomic structure shift, like I'm a puzzle with pieces suddenly missing.\n\nYou wanted truth? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written your name in the margins of every book I own. I wake up at 4:47 AM consistently, for no reason except my body knows that's when you sometimes stir in your sleep. I've become a collector of your smallest gestures\u2014the way you touch your throat when you're nervous, how you alphabetize everything except your feelings, the fact that you eat sandwiches in a spiral pattern that defies all logic but makes perfect sense because it's you.\n\nI'm not offering you perfection. I'm offering you someone who will love you like a verb, not a noun. Someone who will choose you during every mundane apocalypse, every 2 AM doubt, every Thursday when the world feels too heavy. I'm offering you my specific, flawed, overwhelming love that knows your middle name is actually your grandmother's first name, that you're allergic to cats but pet them anyway, that you've read \"The Little Prince\" twenty-three times and cry at the same part every time.\n\nMarry me. Not because I've written you a beautiful letter, but because I want to write you a beautiful life. One where your strange fits perfectly against my strange. Where every ordinary day becomes mythology because we're living it together.\n\nI love you.

Here's mine: I used to be a competent person. I could balance equations, hold conversations, remember where I put my keys. Then you walked into that coffee shop wearing your grandfather's watch\u2014too big for your wrist\u2014and asked if the seat across from me was taken. Now I find myself standing in grocery stores, forgetting what I came for, because I'm thinking about how you eat strawberries: methodically, saving the sweetest bite for last. This is what you've done to me. You've turned me into someone who sees the entire world as a series of moments that either contain you or don't.\n\nThe terrifying thing about truth is how ordinary it looks. It's not the grand declarations or the swooning poetry. It's this: how you leave bobby pins like breadcrumbs throughout my apartment\u2014small black reminders that you exist in my spaces. It's how I've started buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to love. It's the way my body has memorized your breathing pattern so precisely that I wake up when it changes, some primitive part of my brain needing to ensure you're okay.\n\nI love you like a fact, not a feeling. The way water freezes at thirty-two degrees, the way light takes eight minutes to travel from the sun\u2014these are not choices or opinions. They simply are. That's how I love you. It exists outside of my control, beyond my comprehension, more reliable than my own heartbeat.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me, Leyi: I would rather live in a world where loving you destroys me than in one where I never knew this existed. You've ruined me for any life that doesn't have you reading ingredient labels out loud in the supermarket, you getting unreasonably competitive during board games, you falling asleep during movies but insisting you were \"just resting your eyes.\"\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because you complete me\u2014that would make you a utility, and you are not functional; you are essential. I'm asking because when I imagine explaining to our hypothetical children why the sky is blue or why we dream, I can only imagine your voice mixing with mine in the answer. Because when I think about growing old, I specifically think about your hands becoming maps of every small thing we've built together.\n\nThis is my promise: I will love you badly on the days I cannot love you well. I will choose you when choice is all I have. I will memorize every version of you\u2014morning you who steals all the blankets, midnight you who questions if you're enough (you are, you are, you are), Sunday you who dances to no music in the kitchen. I will love each iteration as fiercely as the first.\n\nYou wanted truth? The truth is that before you, I was complete. I was whole. I didn't need you. But knowing you exist has made every moment without you feel like holding my breath. Not because I cannot survive alone, but because breathing with you is so magnificently better than breathing without you.\n\nMarry me.

I only know how to love you completely, catastrophically, with the kind of desperate intensity that makes me check your breathing in the middle of the night to make sure you're still real. This isn't romantic. It's mental illness, probably. But it's also the sanest thing I've ever felt.\n\nBefore you, I had a personality. Hobbies. Opinions about things that mattered. Now I'm just a collection of moments that orbit around you: the way you bite your thumb when you're concentrating, how you smell like vanilla and anxiety, the fact that you've kept every movie ticket from dates we've been on stuffed in your wallet like evidence of something you're afraid to lose. I know because I do the same thing.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: Sometimes I resent you for how much I need you. For making me this pathetic. Yesterday I found one of your hair ties under my car seat and almost cried. Who have I become? Someone who treasures your garbage, apparently. Someone who's memorized the exact sound of your disappointment, the specific weight of your silence when you're deciding whether to forgive me.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me want to survive myself. Before you, I was cosplaying at being alive\u2014showing up, performing wellness, fooling everyone except the mirror. Then you looked at me like I was worth looking at, and suddenly I had to become someone who deserved that gaze. Not better. Just more honest. More present. More likely to say the thing that scares me.\n\nI love you like a wound that won't heal. Like a chronic condition. Like something that happened to me rather than something I chose. When medical students study love, they should study mine\u2014how it reorganized my entire molecular structure, how it made me allergic to any future that doesn't have you mispronouncing words with absolute confidence, you eating cereal at midnight like a feral cat, you touching my face in the dark just to make sure I'm still there.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then realize what you've done\u2014shackled yourself to someone who loves you so badly, so messily, with such desperate animal need that it embarrasses both of us. I'm the man who saves your voicemails to listen to when you're in the next room. Who's already planned your funeral in seventeen different ways because my anxiety needs to prepare for every possible ending. Who practices proposing in the shower and still fucked it up when it mattered.\n\nBut I'm also the man who knows you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box. Who knows you're afraid you inherited his sadness. Who sees you flinch when people say you look like him, and loves you harder in those moments\u2014not despite the darkness but because of it. Because you trusted me with it. Because you let me see the parts of you that aren't ready for public consumption.\n\nThis is what I'm offering: not a fairy tale but a documentary. Real life where I love you on Mondays when everything is hard. Where I choose you during every petty argument about the thermostat. Where I fail you in small ways and spend the rest of my life trying to make up for it. Where we grow old and strange together, and I still get stupid when you walk into a room at seventy-five.\n\nI'm not your soulmate. I don't believe in souls. I'm just the person who knows you organize your books by how they made you feel, that you test if pasta's done by throwing it at the wall even though it never sticks, that you're the bravest coward I've ever met\u2014afraid of spiders but not of loving someone who's this much of a mess.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I can, it would just be grayer, quieter, less worth documenting. Marry me because when I imagine dying, the only thing that makes it bearable is thinking you'll be there, probably complaining that I'm being dramatic, definitely holding my hand anyway.\n\nI love you. Truthfully. Terribly. Without eloquence or elegance. Just this raw, unwieldy thing that makes me write love letters at 4 AM because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you:\n\nYou are the best thing I never saw coming.\n\nYours (pathetically, completely),\nWarren\n\nP.S.
