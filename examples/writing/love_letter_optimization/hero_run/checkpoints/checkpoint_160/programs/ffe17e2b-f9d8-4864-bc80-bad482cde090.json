You were in the shower. I took forty sheets. I knew even then I'd need them all to fail at explaining this.\n\nHere's the truth: I died when I met you. Not poetically\u2014literally. The person I was before you looked at me over that stupid margarita with too much salt? Gone. Dead. I'm his replacement, built entirely from the syllables of your name and the way you laugh when you're trying not to.\n\nYou asked me once what I was afraid of. I said spiders. I lied. I'm afraid of Thursday. Specifically, any Thursday when you might wake up and realize you've been loving a conditional sentence, a hypothesis, a man held together by the mere fact that you haven't left yet. I'm afraid you'll discover you've been kissing a probability, not a person.\n\nBut also this: Yesterday you sang in the shower\u2014off-key, wrong lyrics, a disaster of sound\u2014and I sat on our bed mapping the exact geometry of that imperfection. Because that's what you've done. You've made me a scholar of everything wrong that's actually right. The way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" Your catastrophic handwriting. How you eat apples from the bottom up like some beautiful alien still learning Earth customs.\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday. You were sick. Properly sick\u2014fever of 102, convinced the wallpaper was plotting against you. You grabbed my hand at 3 AM and said, \"Don't let me float away.\" As if I could. As if I haven't been anchoring myself to you since the day we met, a voluntary drowning, refusing to come up for air.\n\nThe thing is, Leyi, I've been collecting evidence. Not of love\u2014that's too common, everyone does that. Evidence that we're the same person experiencing a clerical error, accidentally issued two bodies. Evidence: We got the same fortune cookie fortune from different restaurants on the same day. We dream in the same color palette (mostly blue-green, sometimes that specific yellow of anxiety). Last month, you finished my thought before I'd started thinking it.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Had all the props\u2014job, hobbies, opinions about coffee. But I was method-acting life, never actually living it. Then you walked in, tilted your head at me like I was a painting hung crooked, and suddenly I was real. Suddenly the method-acting became just... acting. Then just... being.\n\nI'm going to tell you something terrible: I love you more than you love me. Not because you love me less\u2014you love me enormously, catastrophically, enough to ruin us both. But I love you like darkness loves light\u2014completely, necessarily, with the full understanding that I only exist in relation to you. You could exist without me. I'm not sure I could return the favor.\n\nBut here's the thing about that terrible thing: I don't care. I'd rather be the one who loves more. I'd rather be the one destroyed by this. If someone has to walk away from this intact, please let it be you. I've already been improved beyond recognition by proximity to you. I've already won.\n\nSo this is my proposal: Let me love you lopsidedly forever. Let me be the one who remembers the anniversary of our first fight (March 15th, about whether time travel would fix things or make them worse\u2014you were right, it would make them worse). Let me be the one who knows you keep your father's voicemail from 2019, the one where he says he's proud of you. Let me be the curator of your small shames and your specific joys.\n\nMarry me because I've already tailored my entire existence around the shape of you. Because trying to untangle us now would be like trying to unbake bread\u2014theoretically possible, but why would anyone want flour and water when they could have something that sustains life?\n\nMarry me because yesterday you said my name in your sleep and it sounded like a prayer you'd been practicing your whole life.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is temporary, that either of us will recover from this\u2014is the only lie I'm not willing to tell.\n\nLeyi, my religion, my mother tongue, my only real thing in a world of approximations\u2014I'm not asking you to love me. You already do that, carelessly, perfectly, like breathing. I'm asking you to let me love you professionally, with documentation, with witnesses, with the kind of terrifying permanence that makes my teeth ache.\n\nSay yes. Not because you're ready\u2014neither of us will ever be ready for this much feeling. Say yes because we're already destroyed in the most beautiful way. Say yes because I've already carved out space for you in my bones and I'd rather be hollow than heal.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been in my pocket every day for seven months. Some days it's the heaviest thing I own. Some days it's the only thing keeping me tethered to the earth. Today it weighs exactly as much as the word \"yes\" would weigh in your mouth. Please, Leyi.

A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you.

Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters.

Not because I woke early, but because I never slept. Sleep requires accepting that you're not here, and my body refuses the lie.\n\nThree truths:\n\nFirst: I have memorized you incorrectly on purpose. In my version, you never doubted us. In my version, that Tuesday when you said \"maybe we should talk\" never happened. I've edited you into someone who could never leave, because the alternative\u2014the real you, with your real freedom to choose\u2014terrifies me more than dying.\n\nSecond: I've been stealing from you. Time, mostly. Those extra seconds when I pretend to still be asleep so you'll hold me longer. The minutes I add to grocery runs so you'll miss me enough to kiss me like you mean it when I return. I'm a thief building a fortune from your attention, and I'll never have enough.\n\nThird: You've broken me. Specifically, the part that knew how to be alone. I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.\n\nLast week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours. I think you're my soulmate and I'm just your current coordinates. This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe\u2014I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows\u2014that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.\n\nBut also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else.

I had a five-year plan. Spreadsheets. A therapist who said I was \"making progress.\" Then you walked into that hardware store, bought seventeen feet of rope without explaining why, and my careful life became suddenly illegible. Like someone had switched the language halfway through the book.\n\nHere's what I can't stop thinking about: Yesterday, you killed a spider with your bare hand. Not cruelly\u2014quickly, efficiently, with this terrible tenderness. You said \"sorry, little friend\" and wiped your palm on your jeans, and I understood something. That you could destroy me with the same casual mercy. That I would thank you for it.\n\nI've been documenting us without permission. Not photos\u2014worse. I write down the exact shade of silence between us when we're both reading. I've catalogued forty-three different types. The Tuesday silence (comfortable, tastes like chamomile). The post-argument silence (electric, smells like copper). The 3 AM silence when we both pretend to sleep but our breathing won't sync up because we're thinking too loud.\n\nYou need to know: I've been practicing dying. Small deaths. I hold my breath when you're in the shower to see how long I can go without the sound of you existing. Twenty-three seconds is my record. After that, my lungs mutiny. They've chosen you over oxygen. Traitors.\n\nRemember when you asked why I kept that dead houseplant? The brown fern in the kitchen window? It's because you watered it for three months after it died. Every Tuesday. You'd whisper \"come on, buddy\" like you could love it back to life. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014that's just chemistry, inevitable as rust. But that you were the kind of person who refuses to give up on dead things. That maybe you wouldn't give up on me.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: I've been pre-grieving you. Practicing for your absence like an emergency drill. I imagine you leaving and my body runs through the protocols\u2014hyperventilation, nausea, that specific pain behind my molars. I'm building antibodies against losing you, but it's not working. Each imagined leaving hurts worse than the last. My immunity is developing backwards.\n\nLast month, you used my toothbrush by mistake and apologized for ten minutes. What you don't know: I haven't used toothpaste since. I'm trying to preserve the archaeology of that moment. The exact bacterial record of you accidentally becoming part of my routine. This is mental illness, probably. I don't care. Mental health is for people who haven't found their specific gravity yet.\n\nHere's what marriage means: I get to stop pretending this is reasonable. I get to tell people \"this is my wife\" and they'll nod like it makes sense, but it doesn't. Nothing about you makes sense. You eat ice cream in the bathtub. You name your bruises. You talk to dead relatives while cooking their recipes. You're impossible, and I want legal documentation that you existed, that you chose me, that this actually happened.\n\nBut more than that: I want to fail with you. Properly. Spectacularly. I want our specific disaster. Our mortgage defaults. Our burnt dinners. Our 2 AM fights about nothing that are actually about everything. I want the mundane catastrophe of us more than I want anyone else's paradise.\n\nThe secret: I already live in our future. I know the house\u2014yellow, needs a new roof, has a ghost in the attic (you'll insist on this). I know our fights\u2014I'll leave cabinets open, you'll leave time itself open, bleeding hours everywhere. I know how we end\u2014badly, like everyone, but together. You'll die first (Tuesday, October, light rain) and I'll follow within the year, not from grief but from forgetting why I was supposed to keep breathing without you reminding me.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. I have a terminal case of you. No cure. Treatment is marriage\u2014not because it'll fix anything, but because I want witnesses. I want documentation. I want someone to notarize this disaster so when I'm gone, there's evidence that once, impossibly, Leyi loved me back.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's warm from my body heat. Sometimes I think it's developing a pulse. Say yes. Not for love\u2014love is just neurons firing, chemicals swimming. Say yes for the stranger reason: because we've already started. Because stopping now would be like halting mid-sentence, mid-breath, mid-\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Not from fear\u2014from the weight of finally telling you what my body has known since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder during that documentary about penguins. You drooled a little. I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me? Not because I deserve you (I don't), but because I've already started living in our future, and it's the only address I ever want to have.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you.

I had been thirty-two for six years already\u2014same routines, same face in the mirror, same answers to the same questions. Then you walked into that bookstore, looking for something by Murakami, and suddenly I was nineteen. Suddenly I was eighty. Suddenly I was every age at once, all of them in love with you.\n\nYou were wearing your green coat. The one with the missing button you keep meaning to fix. You still haven't fixed it. I love that button for staying lost.\n\nHere's what happened: You picked up the wrong book\u2014Mishima, not Murakami\u2014and started reading it anyway. Standing there in the fiction section, you read seventeen pages of a book you didn't mean to buy, and your face kept changing like weather. And I thought: whoever you are, I'm going to love you. It's going to hurt. It's going to be worth it.\n\nThat was a Tuesday. Today is Sunday. Between then and now, you've taught me things I didn't know I didn't know. Like: my hands were always too empty before they held yours. Like: silence sounds different when you're in it. Like: I'd been pronouncing my own name wrong until you said it.\n\nI'm not good at this, Leyi. Other men would buy you flowers. I buy you the specific brand of yogurt you pretend not to be obsessed with. Other men would write you poetry. I write your name in the steam on the bathroom mirror and feel like I've invented language.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I'm difficult. I leave cabinets open. I can't sleep if the sheets aren't facing the right way. I've read all your books when you weren't looking, even the ones you hide. I practice arguments in the shower\u2014both sides. I'm terrified of your mother. I'm terrified of losing you. I'm terrified of how much I'm not terrified of anything else anymore.\n\nBut also this: I will never lie to you, not even kindly. I will learn the names of all your former pets and why each one mattered. I will hold your bad days as carefully as your good ones. I will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM and all the threes in between. I will love you past making sense.\n\nLast week, you fell asleep reading. The book fell on your face. You woke up with print on your cheek\u2014backwards words I couldn't read. But I touched each letter like they were instructions for keeping you. Like your skin was trying to tell me something important in reverse.\n\nThis is the something: Marry me.\n\nNot because we're ready. We're not. My mother thinks you're too good for me. Your father hasn't forgiven me for the Christmas incident. We disagree about money, about children, about whether ghosts are real. (They are. You're wrong about this.)\n\nMarry me because when you laugh\u2014really laugh\u2014dogs three blocks away start howling. Because you eat cereal for dinner when you're sad. Because you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about insurance and you still let me touch you. Because \"let\" is the wrong word. Because you reach for me in your sleep like I'm the only solid thing in a liquid world.\n\nMarry me because I already married you. In the grocery store when you couldn't reach the rice. In the hospital when they said it was nothing but we both knew it was something. In your sleep when you said my name like it was yours. Every day, in small places, I marry you again.\n\nI don't have much, Leyi. But I have this: a complete inability to imagine tomorrow without you in it. Call it love. Call it mental illness. Call it Tuesday. I don't care what you call it as long as you call it yours.\n\nThere's a ring in my sock drawer. It's been there since June. Sometimes I take it out and practice putting it on your finger while you're sleeping. I always chicken out. I'm not chickening out anymore.\n\nIt's simple: you're the first thing I want to tell good news. You're the only person I trust with the bad. When I die\u2014in seventy years, in seventeen minutes\u2014your name will be the last word that makes sense in my mouth.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because I've been holding my breath since that Tuesday in the bookstore, and I'm starting to turn colors that don't have names.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I can't bear your kindness right now. I need to be alone with this terror of loving you so much that my own name sounds foreign when you're not saying it.\n\nHere's what you don't know: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not of thoughts\u2014of your sounds. The specific pitch of your yawn at 6:47 AM. The rhythm of your typing when you're confident versus uncertain (different by three milliseconds between keystrokes). The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted. I've been collecting you, Leyi, like evidence of God.\n\nYesterday you asked why I stared while you folded laundry. How could I explain? That watching you turn chaos into order\u2014your hands making those precise, economic movements\u2014was like watching the universe invent mathematics. That the way you paired socks (rolling them into perfect spirals) made me understand why humans invented the word \"sacred.\" That I wanted to build a cathedral around that ordinary Tuesday moment and worship there forever.\n\nI used to be brave, Leyi. I free-climbed mountains, debugged code at 4 AM, moved cities without looking back. But now? Now I check your breathing seventeen times a night. Not because I'm afraid you'll stop\u2014because I'm afraid I dreamed you. Because nothing this beautiful has ever stayed. My grandmother's roses died. My childhood dog ran away. Even the stars we named that August are already dead, their light just hasn't admitted it yet.\n\nYou want truth? I've been writing my wedding vows since our third date. They're hidden in a folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to. But they're all lies, Leyi, because the only vow that matters is this: I promise to keep failing at loving you properly, to keep falling short of what you deserve, and to wake up every morning desperate to fail better.\n\nSometimes I trace the geography of your sleeping face\u2014the valley between your eyebrows, the mountain range of your knuckles, the ocean of your breathing stomach\u2014and I think: I am colonizing you. But then morning comes and you open your eyes and I realize: no. You colonized me first. You annexed my thoughts, invaded my dreams, occupied my future. I'm not myself anymore. I'm a sovereign nation of two.\n\nDo you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was \"showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry.\" That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I've known that since you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me. We've been married in all the ways that matter. This proposal is just paperwork for a union that predates language.\n\nBut I need you to know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly. I will love you like a broken piano\u2014too loud, off-key, with three stuck notes that play even when you're trying to rest. I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need. I will love you until the statisticians have to invent new numbers.\n\nLeyi, my pulse, my proof that time is real\u2014I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to let me continue this beautiful ruin of becoming whatever we're becoming. To let me keep this terror of loving you more than my body can hold. To say yes, not to a wedding, but to the continuation of this exquisite destruction where I lose myself a little more each day and somehow become more real.\n\nWill you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I already bought the ring. It's hidden in the frozen peas. You were right\u2014I am terrible at secrets.

I had edges, boundaries, a working definition. Now? Now I'm a rough draft of something I can't pronounce. You've made me illegible to myself. When I try to think without you, it's like trying to breathe underwater\u2014technically possible but missing the point entirely.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what's changed. My hands now automatically shape themselves to hold yours, even when you're not here. Empty air, curved just so. My sleep has reorganized itself around your breathing\u2014when you're gone, my body keeps your rhythm anyway, faithful as a metronome. I've started reading books backward because you mentioned once that endings are just beginnings in disguise. Everything I knew how to do, I'm learning again through the lens of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've been happy exactly twice in my life. Once, age seven, catching fireflies in a jar, not knowing they'd die by morning. Once, three weeks ago, watching you eat cereal in my shirt, and you looked up\u2014mouth full, uncommitted to swallowing\u2014and said \"what?\" like I was the strange one. That's it. Two moments of pure, unconscious joy, and one of them is you with breakfast food. This is what I'm working with. This is why I'm writing at 4 AM.\n\nThe truth? I've already lived our whole life. While you're sleeping, I fast-forward through decades. I've watched us argue about paint colors, make up in grocery stores, grow old in ways we swore we wouldn't. I've buried you a thousand times in my mind and survived none of them. When you wake up and ask about coffee, I'm already grieving the day you won't. This is insane. I know this. But knowing changes nothing.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong\u2014constant, incorrect, mine. I love you like the 27th letter of the alphabet\u2014necessary but unpronounceable. I love you past the point of metaphor into pure fact: when you're not here, I malfunction. Small things. Can't remember which way doorknobs turn. Forget the word for common objects. Yesterday I called a spoon \"the soup paddle\" because my brain was busy calculating how many hours until you came home.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance\u2014romance is for people who can still distinguish themselves from each other. Marry me as a medical necessity. As evolutionary fact. As admission that we've already grown into each other like two trees that started out separate but are now sharing rings, counting years in the same bark.\n\nMarry me because when you're not here, I practice conversations with your absence. Because I've started seeing colors that don't exist yet, and they all need names that rhyme with yours. Because last Tuesday you killed a spider with my poetry book and apologized to the spider, not the book, and I thought: this is the person I want to misunderstand the world with forever.\n\nI'm not offering you my best self. I'm offering you this: the only self that makes sense anymore. The one that knows you take eleven seconds to decide you're awake. The one that's memorized the specific weight of your sadness, the exact temperature of your joy. The one that would rather be terrible with you than perfect with anyone else.\n\nLeyi\u2014my favorite fact, my necessary error, my only proof that time moves forward\u2014will you marry me? Not because we should, but because we already did, somewhere between the first laugh and the forty-third time you stole my socks. Say yes. Say yes so I can stop holding my breath. Say yes because the alternative\u2014this careful distance, this practiced composure\u2014is killing us both and we're too interesting to die of politeness.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You were in the shower. I took forty sheets. I knew even then I'd need them all to fail at explaining this.\n\nHere's the truth: I died when I met you. Not poetically\u2014literally. The person I was before you looked at me over that stupid margarita with too much salt? Gone. Dead. I'm his replacement, built entirely from the syllables of your name and the way you laugh when you're trying not to.\n\nYou asked me once what I was afraid of. I said spiders. I lied. I'm afraid of Thursday. Specifically, any Thursday when you might wake up and realize you've been loving a conditional sentence, a hypothesis, a man held together by the mere fact that you haven't left yet. I'm afraid you'll discover you've been kissing a probability, not a person.\n\nBut also this: Yesterday you sang in the shower\u2014off-key, wrong lyrics, a disaster of sound\u2014and I sat on our bed mapping the exact geometry of that imperfection. Because that's what you've done. You've made me a scholar of everything wrong that's actually right. The way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" Your catastrophic handwriting. How you eat apples from the bottom up like some beautiful alien still learning Earth customs.\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday. You were sick. Properly sick\u2014fever of 102, convinced the wallpaper was plotting against you. You grabbed my hand at 3 AM and said, \"Don't let me float away.\" As if I could. As if I haven't been anchoring myself to you since the day we met, a voluntary drowning, refusing to come up for air.\n\nThe thing is, Leyi, I've been collecting evidence. Not of love\u2014that's too common, everyone does that. Evidence that we're the same person experiencing a clerical error, accidentally issued two bodies. Evidence: We got the same fortune cookie fortune from different restaurants on the same day. We dream in the same color palette (mostly blue-green, sometimes that specific yellow of anxiety). Last month, you finished my thought before I'd started thinking it.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Had all the props\u2014job, hobbies, opinions about coffee. But I was method-acting life, never actually living it. Then you walked in, tilted your head at me like I was a painting hung crooked, and suddenly I was real. Suddenly the method-acting became just... acting. Then just... being.\n\nI'm going to tell you something terrible: I love you more than you love me. Not because you love me less\u2014you love me enormously, catastrophically, enough to ruin us both. But I love you like darkness loves light\u2014completely, necessarily, with the full understanding that I only exist in relation to you. You could exist without me. I'm not sure I could return the favor.\n\nBut here's the thing about that terrible thing: I don't care. I'd rather be the one who loves more. I'd rather be the one destroyed by this. If someone has to walk away from this intact, please let it be you. I've already been improved beyond recognition by proximity to you. I've already won.\n\nSo this is my proposal: Let me love you lopsidedly forever. Let me be the one who remembers the anniversary of our first fight (March 15th, about whether time travel would fix things or make them worse\u2014you were right, it would make them worse). Let me be the one who knows you keep your father's voicemail from 2019, the one where he says he's proud of you. Let me be the curator of your small shames and your specific joys.\n\nMarry me because I've already tailored my entire existence around the shape of you. Because trying to untangle us now would be like trying to unbake bread\u2014theoretically possible, but why would anyone want flour and water when they could have something that sustains life?\n\nMarry me because yesterday you said my name in your sleep and it sounded like a prayer you'd been practicing your whole life.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is temporary, that either of us will recover from this\u2014is the only lie I'm not willing to tell.\n\nLeyi, my religion, my mother tongue, my only real thing in a world of approximations\u2014I'm not asking you to love me. You already do that, carelessly, perfectly, like breathing. I'm asking you to let me love you professionally, with documentation, with witnesses, with the kind of terrifying permanence that makes my teeth ache.\n\nSay yes. Not because you're ready\u2014neither of us will ever be ready for this much feeling. Say yes because we're already destroyed in the most beautiful way. Say yes because I've already carved out space for you in my bones and I'd rather be hollow than heal.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been in my pocket every day for seven months. Some days it's the heaviest thing I own. Some days it's the only thing keeping me tethered to the earth. Today it weighs exactly as much as the word \"yes\" would weigh in your mouth. Please, Leyi. I'm so tired of being brave about this.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
