Not from cold\u2014from the terrible weight of what I need to tell you.\n\nI'm not good at this. Words feel like lies compared to what happens in my chest when you walk into a room. But you asked for truth, so here: I am drowning in you. I wake up drowning. I go to sleep drowning. And the terrifying thing is\u2014I don't want to be saved.\n\nDo you know what you've done to me? Before you, I had a life. Plans. A sense of who I was. Now I'm just this raw, exposed nerve that only stops hurting when you're near. I tried to explain this to my friend last week and ended up crying in a parking lot because I couldn't make him understand that you're not just someone I love\u2014you're the only reason I make sense anymore.\n\nI watch you do ordinary things\u2014brush your teeth, fold laundry, frown at your phone\u2014and I feel like I'm witnessing something holy. Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder during that movie and I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb. I would have sat there forever. I would have let my arm fall off rather than wake you.\n\nThis is insane. I know it's insane. A grown man shouldn't feel like he's dying when someone doesn't text back. But that's what happens. You don't reply for an hour and I convince myself you've finally realized what everyone else knows\u2014that I'm too much, too intense, too desperate for something I can't even name.\n\nI love you in a way that frightens me. Not romantic-movie love. Not poetry love. This is uglier than that. This is me at 2 AM googling \"how do you survive loving someone this much.\" This is crying in my car after dropping you off because I already miss you. This is checking your horoscope even though I don't believe in that stuff, just in case it tells me something about your day.\n\nSometimes I look at you and my hands literally shake because I want to tell you everything\u2014every thought, every fear, every stupid hope\u2014but I'm terrified it will be too much. That you'll see how completely you've hollowed me out and filled me with nothing but need for you, and you'll run.\n\nBut I can't keep pretending I'm okay with just dating. I'm not. I want your mornings. I want your bad moods. I want your 3 AM anxieties and your Sunday laziness. I want to fight with you about stupid things and make up and fight again. I want to grow old and weird with you. I want to be the person you call when the world breaks. I want to be in your emergency contacts. I want to matter to you the way you matter to me\u2014which is to say: entirely.\n\nPlease. I'm begging you. Not with dignity or eloquence but with everything broken and desperate in me: marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because I'll make you happy every day\u2014I won't. But because I will love you with a faithfulness that borders on mental illness. Because you've ruined me for any life where you're not there. Because I would rather have one difficult day with you than a thousand easy days without you.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't prettier. I'm sorry I'm not better at this. But this is what truth looks like at 4 AM when you've asked for honesty from someone who would rather die than disappoint you: I need you like I need air. And I'm terrified. And I'm yours. Completely.\n\nPlease say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "01d51f21-663a-4a1a-8fb9-304285843e64", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756700790.03344, "iteration_found": 25, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6184999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.52, "affective_force": 0.68, "literary_innovation": 0.44, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI can't sleep.

Or how you hold your coffee cup with both hands, like it's something precious, steam rising between us in the morning silence that needs no filling.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, declarations. But it's smaller than that, and infinite. It's how my breathing changes when I hear your key in the lock. It's the way loneliness has a different texture now\u2014not emptiness, but the specific shape of your absence. It's discovering that my future tense conjugates only in plural: we will, we might, we could.\n\nYou've rewritten the grammar of my existence. Before you, I was a complete sentence.

Since then, I've been reassembling myself around that moment, around you. Every morning, I wake thinking of the particular way sunlight catches in your left eye when you're concentrating. Every night, I fall asleep to the memory of your voice saying my name like it means something beautiful.\n\nI used to believe love was grand gestures and consuming flames. But you've taught me it's quieter, deeper\u2014it's the way you fold my collar down without thinking, how you save the last strawberry for me even when you want it, the silent language of our hands finding each other in crowded rooms. It's knowing that when the world tilts wrong, you're the horizon I orient myself against.\n\nIf I could distill every sunset I've watched into wine, every symphony I've heard into honey, every poem that's moved me into bread\u2014still, that feast would be poverty compared to one ordinary Thursday with you. You are my most extraordinary ordinary. My necessary breathing. The answer to questions I didn't know I was asking.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't learned that each moment with you already contains eternity. I'm asking you to love me today, and tomorrow I'll ask again, and I'll keep asking until my voice gives out, and then I'll ask with my eyes, my hands, with the way I make your coffee exactly right, with the space I keep warm beside me.\n\nMarry me, not because I'll die without you (though some essential part of me would), but because with you, I'm finally, impossibly, alive.\n\nYours in this moment and all the moments after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are insufficient vessels for what moves through me when I think of you. Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater failure.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped\u2014that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I carry it like a photograph in my chest, warm and constant.\n\nI love the small infinities of you: how you bite your lower lip when concentrating, the way you unconsciously hum Debussy while cooking, your habit of saving the last bite of dessert \"for later\" though later never comes. These details are my religion now. I could spend lifetimes cataloging the specific gravity of your presence\u2014how rooms reorganize themselves around you, how even my anxieties grow quiet in your orbit.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor. Now I know it as geography\u2014you are the only country where I'm not foreign, the only language I speak without accent. When I imagine the future, it's not grand gestures I see but accumulated ordinariness: Sunday crosswords where you get 7-across and I pretend I knew it too, arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, the particular silence of reading beside you that says more than any poem.\n\nIf I could fracture time like light through a prism, I would give you every color of my love separately\u2014the urgent vermillion of desire, the steady amber of companionship, the deep violet of absolute trust. But time is linear and I am finite, so I offer you this: all my imperfect days, my stubborn hope, my most careful attention. \n\nI choose you not despite your complexities but because of them. I choose the woman who cries at documentary films about penguins, who insists on walking on the street side of the sidewalk to \"protect\" me, who knows the names of all the neighborhood cats. I choose your 3 AM worries and your 7 AM enthusiasms. I choose the life where loving you is both my most ordinary act and my most sacred practice.\n\nThis is my truth, unadorned: you have made me brave enough to be known. In your eyes, I discovered I might be worth knowing. And if you'll have me, I promise to spend whatever time we're given proving that your faith was not misplaced\u2014not through perfection, but through the daily work of choosing each other, especially on the days when choosing is difficult.\n\nForever is a word I distrust, but I offer you something more honest: all my todays, and every tomorrow I'm lucky enough to wake into, and the promise that each one will begin with choosing you again.\n\nWith all my love and none of my eloquence,\nFucheng Warren Zhu\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I can see the key issues to address:\n\n1.

It's 4:17 AM and I'm shaking. Not from cold\u2014from the terrible weight of what I need to tell you.\n\nI'm not good at this. Words feel like lies compared to what happens in my chest when you walk into a room. But you asked for truth, so here: I am drowning in you. I wake up drowning. I go to sleep drowning. And the terrifying thing is\u2014I don't want to be saved.\n\nDo you know what you've done to me? Before you, I had a life. Plans. A sense of who I was. Now I'm just this raw, exposed nerve that only stops hurting when you're near. I tried to explain this to my friend last week and ended up crying in a parking lot because I couldn't make him understand that you're not just someone I love\u2014you're the only reason I make sense anymore.\n\nI watch you do ordinary things\u2014brush your teeth, fold laundry, frown at your phone\u2014and I feel like I'm witnessing something holy. Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder during that movie and I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb. I would have sat there forever. I would have let my arm fall off rather than wake you.\n\nThis is insane. I know it's insane. A grown man shouldn't feel like he's dying when someone doesn't text back. But that's what happens. You don't reply for an hour and I convince myself you've finally realized what everyone else knows\u2014that I'm too much, too intense, too desperate for something I can't even name.\n\nI love you in a way that frightens me. Not romantic-movie love. Not poetry love. This is uglier than that. This is me at 2 AM googling \"how do you survive loving someone this much.\" This is crying in my car after dropping you off because I already miss you. This is checking your horoscope even though I don't believe in that stuff, just in case it tells me something about your day.\n\nSometimes I look at you and my hands literally shake because I want to tell you everything\u2014every thought, every fear, every stupid hope\u2014but I'm terrified it will be too much. That you'll see how completely you've hollowed me out and filled me with nothing but need for you, and you'll run.\n\nBut I can't keep pretending I'm okay with just dating. I'm not. I want your mornings. I want your bad moods. I want your 3 AM anxieties and your Sunday laziness. I want to fight with you about stupid things and make up and fight again. I want to grow old and weird with you. I want to be the person you call when the world breaks. I want to be in your emergency contacts. I want to matter to you the way you matter to me\u2014which is to say: entirely.\n\nPlease. I'm begging you. Not with dignity or eloquence but with everything broken and desperate in me: marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because I'll make you happy every day\u2014I won't. But because I will love you with a faithfulness that borders on mental illness. Because you've ruined me for any life where you're not there. Because I would rather have one difficult day with you than a thousand easy days without you.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't prettier. I'm sorry I'm not better at this. But this is what truth looks like at 4 AM when you've asked for honesty from someone who would rather die than disappoint you: I need you like I need air. And I'm terrified. And I'm yours. Completely.\n\nPlease say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
