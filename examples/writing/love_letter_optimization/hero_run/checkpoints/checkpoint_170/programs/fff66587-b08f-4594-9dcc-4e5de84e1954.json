The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.\n\nI've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours. Have been since that Tuesday when you laughed at my quantum physics joke and the universe cracked open and reorganized itself around the sound.\n\nYours in this reality and all parallel dimensions,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you wake up. You're looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here, on this floor, surrounded by failed drafts, and you'll ask if I'm okay. I'll lie and say yes. But this letter is the truth. This letter is my whole truth.

But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel, how it rewrites the grammar of my days.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor\u2014hearts and flowers, promises carved in air. But you taught me love as syntax: how your laugh punctuates my mornings, how your silences speak louder than any vow. When you read, tucking that strand of hair behind your ear, I understand why ancient philosophers believed in the music of the spheres. You are my quantum entanglement\u2014changing me by existing, no matter the distance.\n\nI remember Tuesday, 3:47 AM, you sleeping beside me, the streetlight through blinds painting tiger stripes across your shoulder. I counted your breaths\u2014seventeen per minute\u2014and realized I was synchronizing mine to yours. This is what they don't tell you about love: it's not the grand gestures but the small surrenders. How I now buy two cups when getting coffee, even when alone. How every beautiful thing I see becomes a future conversation with you.\n\nYou know my faults\u2014my tendency to overthink, to build walls from books and irony. But with you, I am catastrophically sincere. You've made me brave enough to admit that I don't just love you; I believe in you the way others believe in gravity or God\u2014as fundamental force, as answered prayer, as the thing that makes all other things make sense.\n\nThis letter is my map of scars and stars, my confession that you've ruined me for any life where you're not there, reading in bed while I write beside you, our feet touching under blankets, building our small forevers from Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise perfection, but because I promise presence\u2014to witness your becoming, to choose you in every parallel universe, to love you with the ferocity of someone who knows what it means to almost not exist, and chooses existence because it means existing with you.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6790, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI don't know how to write this. I've deleted seventeen versions. The truth keeps coming out wrong, too small, like trying to photograph the ocean with a broken phone.\n\nHere's what I know: Yesterday you fell asleep reading. Your thumb was still marking the page. I watched you for forty-three minutes. I counted. This is what I've become\u2014someone who counts the minutes of watching you sleep and considers them the best minutes of his day.\n\nI'm terrified you'll say no. I'm more terrified you'll say yes and someday realize you made a mistake. But I'm most terrified of being the coward who never asked.\n\nYou know that scar on my palm? From when I was seven, tried to catch a falling knife? That's what loving you feels like. Dangerous. Stupid. Inevitable. The thing you do without thinking because not doing it would be worse.\n\nI can't write like poets. I can't promise you forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't watched their parents' marriage implode. But I can promise you this: Tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. I can promise that when you wake up at 3 AM with those nightmares about drowning, I'll be there. Not with answers. Just there.\n\nYou make me want to learn things. Useless things. The names of birds. How to make bread. The difference between cumulus and cirrus clouds. As if knowing things you might find interesting could make me worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nI love you. Not the word\u2014the fact. The physical fact of it. How it sits in my chest like swallowed glass, beautiful and sharp and mine.\n\nI'm not good at this. At words, at feelings, at asking for things I desperately want. But you said you wanted truth, so here: I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you, but because I'm selfish enough to ask anyway.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I'm sitting in our kitchen writing this. You're in the next room. I can hear you humming. It's that song you don't know the words to. This is what I want. Forever. Or tomorrow.

Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound carved itself into my bones. I catch myself smiling at nothing, just remembering. Or how you hold your coffee cup with both hands, like it's something precious, steam rising between us in the morning silence that needs no filling.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, declarations. But it's smaller than that, and infinite. It's how my breathing changes when I hear your key in the lock. It's the way loneliness has a different texture now\u2014not emptiness, but the specific shape of your absence. It's discovering that my future tense conjugates only in plural: we will, we might, we could.\n\nYou've rewritten the grammar of my existence. Before you, I was a complete sentence. Now I know I was just a fragment, waiting for the conjunction.\n\nI'm terrified and certain in equal measure. Terrified because you hold my entire life in your hands without knowing it. Certain because there's no other way I want to live.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a word\u2014but because I promise you this moment, and the next, and every small ordinary miraculous moment I'm given, choosing you again with each breath.\n\nWith a love that remakes me daily,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.5145 while exploring new territory in the solution space.

The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.\n\nI've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours. Have been since that Tuesday when you laughed at my quantum physics joke and the universe cracked open and reorganized itself around the sound.\n\nYours in this reality and all parallel dimensions,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you wake up. You're looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here, on this floor, surrounded by failed drafts, and you'll ask if I'm okay. I'll lie and say yes. But this letter is the truth. This letter is my whole truth. This letter is how okay looks when it's been deconstructed and rebuilt in the shape of your name.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
