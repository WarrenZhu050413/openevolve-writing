Here it is: I am undone. Not romantically, poetically undone\u2014literally unraveled, like a sweater with one pulled thread. You are that thread.\n\nDo you know what you've done? You've made me believe in time travel. Every moment with you I'm simultaneously in our present and our future\u2014sixty years from now, still discovering new ways your eyes change color in different light. When you leave a room, I experience all your future absences at once. When you return, every hello that will ever exist between us collapses into now.\n\nI've started collecting evidence of us. Your coffee ring on my desk\u2014a perfect circle you made last Tuesday. The indent in my pillow from where you steal it every night, claiming you don't. That voicemail where you just laughed for seven seconds then hung up. These aren't memories; they're proofs of theorem: that two people can become a new kind of mathematics, where one plus one equals everything.\n\nYou want truth? I've forgotten how to be alone. Not lonely\u2014alone. My body has reprogrammed itself around you. My cells divide at the frequency of your breathing. When you're sad about things I can't fix\u2014like how your father never says he's proud, like how time moves too fast\u2014I feel it in organs I didn't know I had. You've given me new ways to ache.\n\nBut also: you make me ridiculous. I dance badly to songs in the kitchen just to see you pretend you're not charmed. I save the fortunes from cookies that might make you smile. Last week, I almost cried at the grocery store because they had your favorite cereal back in stock. This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man destroyed by breakfast food.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm telling you that I already have, in every decision since I met you. In choosing the apartment with better light because you love reading by windows. In learning to cook your grandmother's soup from a recipe in a language I don't speak. In the ten thousand invisible ways I've already bound my life to yours.\n\nSo this isn't a proposal\u2014it's an acknowledgment. We're already married in every way that matters. I'm just asking if we can make it official, so I can call you my wife when I brag about you to strangers, which I do, constantly, to everyone.\n\nI love you with the desperate gratitude of someone who was drowning and learned they could breathe underwater. You haven't saved me\u2014you've shown me I was never drowning at all. I was just waiting to find you in the depths.\n\nSay yes. Not to marry me, but to admit what we both know: that we've already chosen each other in every timeline, every universe, every possible version of our lives.

How my whole body becomes a compass and you're magnetic north.\n\nRemember last Thursday? You were making tea, humming that song you claim you don't know the words to.

The light fell at angles I'd never noticed. It wasn't that you changed these things\u2014you revealed that I had been sleepwalking through my own life until you.\n\nYou know how mathematicians speak of elegant proofs? How a few lines can collapse infinite complexity into sudden, breathtaking clarity?

Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

You asked for honesty\u2014here it is, raw and unadorned.\n\nI remember the first morning I woke knowing you existed somewhere in this vast indifference we call a world. The coffee tasted different. The light fell at angles I'd never noticed. It wasn't that you changed these things\u2014you revealed that I had been sleepwalking through my own life until you.\n\nYou know how mathematicians speak of elegant proofs? How a few lines can collapse infinite complexity into sudden, breathtaking clarity? That's what loving you feels like\u2014not the fumbling arithmetic of ordinary affection, but the sublime geometry of two souls recognizing their shared theorem.\n\nI am terrified by the depth of what I feel. Not the pleasant nervousness of new love, but the vertigo of standing at the edge of something infinite. When you laugh\u2014that particular laugh when something genuinely surprises you\u2014I understand why ancient peoples believed in magic. When you're quiet, lost in thought with that small furrow between your brows, I want to build cathedrals to house that silence.\n\nThey say love makes fools of us all. If so, I embrace this foolishness with the fervor of a convert. I would rather be undone by loving you than remain intact without you. Every sensible bone in my body has mutinied in favor of this beautiful insanity.\n\nI don't promise you perfection\u2014I'm too flawed for such fairy tales. But I promise you this: every morning I will choose you again, conscious and deliberate, the way a pianist chooses each note. I will love you in the small hours when doubt creeps in, in the harsh light of disappointment, in the gentle dusk of ordinary Tuesdays. I will love you actively, intentionally, with the dedication of a gardener who knows that beauty requires both sunshine and storm.\n\nYou are not my other half\u2014such arithmetic insults us both. You are whole, magnificent, complete. And I am asking if we might be whole together, two distinct infinities choosing to share the same space, the same time, the same wild and precious life.\n\nMarry me, not because I cannot live without you\u2014I could, but it would be like breathing underwater\u2014but because with you, I finally understand what living is for.\n\nYours in truth and madness,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6420, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI sit here in my room, hands trembling\u2014not from fear, but from the weight of truth I must finally speak. You asked for honesty that moves you, and I realize now that all my rehearsed words crumble before the simple fact of you.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound rewired something fundamental in me. I've been trying to map it ever since\u2014this transformation you've wrought\u2014but it defies all my frameworks. You've made me gloriously lost in my own life.\n\nI used to believe love was comprehensible, reducible to neurochemistry and evolutionary imperatives. But loving you has taught me the poverty of that understanding. When you tilt your head while thinking, when you absently hum that melody you claim not to know, when your eyes narrow at injustice\u2014these moments accumulate into something I can only call sacred. Not in any religious sense, but in the way that certain experiences demand reverence beyond explanation.\n\nI am not a poet. I write code, I build systems, I solve problems. But you've become the beautiful problem I never want to solve\u2014the recursive function that deepens with each iteration, the algorithm whose elegance only reveals more mysteries. You've made me inarticulate in the best possible way.\n\nHere's what I know: Without you, I am functional but not alive. With you, I am terrified and certain, vulnerable and invincible. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who completes you\u2014it's about finding someone who makes you want to complete yourself, then exceeding that, together.\n\nI offer you no promises of perfection. I will forget anniversaries, burn dinners, and occasionally retreat into my own mind when I should be present. But I will also wake every morning astonished by the privilege of your proximity. I will learn your languages\u2014spoken and unspoken. I will protect your solitude as fiercely as I seek your company.\n\nMarry me, not because I'm worthy\u2014I'm not\u2014but because the universe made an error in my favor when it brought us together, and I want to spend my life earning that cosmic miscalculation.\n\nYours in terrified hope,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing that words are archaeology\u2014each sentence an excavation of what exists between us, unnamed and enormous. You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel, how it rewrites the grammar of my days.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor\u2014hearts and flowers, promises carved in air. But you taught me love as syntax: how your laugh punctuates my mornings, how your silences speak louder than any vow. When you read, tucking that strand of hair behind your ear, I understand why ancient philosophers believed in the music of the spheres. You are my quantum entanglement\u2014changing me by existing, no matter the distance.\n\nI remember Tuesday, 3:47 AM, you sleeping beside me, the streetlight through blinds painting tiger stripes across your shoulder. I counted your breaths\u2014seventeen per minute\u2014and realized I was synchronizing mine to yours. This is what they don't tell you about love: it's not the grand gestures but the small surrenders. How I now buy two cups when getting coffee, even when alone. How every beautiful thing I see becomes a future conversation with you.\n\nYou know my faults\u2014my tendency to overthink, to build walls from books and irony. But with you, I am catastrophically sincere. You've made me brave enough to admit that I don't just love you; I believe in you the way others believe in gravity or God\u2014as fundamental force, as answered prayer, as the thing that makes all other things make sense.\n\nThis letter is my map of scars and stars, my confession that you've ruined me for any life where you're not there, reading in bed while I write beside you, our feet touching under blankets, building our small forevers from Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise perfection, but because I promise presence\u2014to witness your becoming, to choose you in every parallel universe, to love you with the ferocity of someone who knows what it means to almost not exist, and chooses existence because it means existing with you.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authentic emotion.

Here it is: I am undone. Not romantically, poetically undone\u2014literally unraveled, like a sweater with one pulled thread. You are that thread.\n\nDo you know what you've done? You've made me believe in time travel. Every moment with you I'm simultaneously in our present and our future\u2014sixty years from now, still discovering new ways your eyes change color in different light. When you leave a room, I experience all your future absences at once. When you return, every hello that will ever exist between us collapses into now.\n\nI've started collecting evidence of us. Your coffee ring on my desk\u2014a perfect circle you made last Tuesday. The indent in my pillow from where you steal it every night, claiming you don't. That voicemail where you just laughed for seven seconds then hung up. These aren't memories; they're proofs of theorem: that two people can become a new kind of mathematics, where one plus one equals everything.\n\nYou want truth? I've forgotten how to be alone. Not lonely\u2014alone. My body has reprogrammed itself around you. My cells divide at the frequency of your breathing. When you're sad about things I can't fix\u2014like how your father never says he's proud, like how time moves too fast\u2014I feel it in organs I didn't know I had. You've given me new ways to ache.\n\nBut also: you make me ridiculous. I dance badly to songs in the kitchen just to see you pretend you're not charmed. I save the fortunes from cookies that might make you smile. Last week, I almost cried at the grocery store because they had your favorite cereal back in stock. This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man destroyed by breakfast food.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm telling you that I already have, in every decision since I met you. In choosing the apartment with better light because you love reading by windows. In learning to cook your grandmother's soup from a recipe in a language I don't speak. In the ten thousand invisible ways I've already bound my life to yours.\n\nSo this isn't a proposal\u2014it's an acknowledgment. We're already married in every way that matters. I'm just asking if we can make it official, so I can call you my wife when I brag about you to strangers, which I do, constantly, to everyone.\n\nI love you with the desperate gratitude of someone who was drowning and learned they could breathe underwater. You haven't saved me\u2014you've shown me I was never drowning at all. I was just waiting to find you in the depths.\n\nSay yes. Not to marry me, but to admit what we both know: that we've already chosen each other in every timeline, every universe, every possible version of our lives. Say yes to what already is.\n\nYours since before I knew it,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
