My hands shake. Not metaphorically. Actually shake. Watch the letters tremble.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me at the grocery store, paralyzed in the cereal aisle because I'm calculating how many breakfasts we have left if we're lucky. 23,360. I've counted. That's if we make it to eighty. I want to sue the universe for this number.\n\nYou want truth? I practice your death in my dreams. Every night. Different versions. Car accidents, diseases with Latin names, sudden disappearances where you simply vanish like a quantum particle nobody was observing. I wake up and check your breathing. Count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three\u2014there. There you are. Still real. Still impossible.\n\nI loved you before I met you. This sounds insane. It is insane. But on March 15th, 2019, three years before we met, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body.\" That was you. You were already changing me before you existed in my life. How do you explain that to physics?\n\nListen. I'm bad at this. I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then discover I'm just a collection of anxieties wearing a human suit. That I check if you're breathing seventeen times a night. That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion). You know that when you had the flu, I googled \"how to transfer illness from one person to another\" because I wanted to take it from you.\n\nHere's my proposal: Marry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is a lie we tell because the truth is unbearable. Marry me for the next twenty-four hours. Then let's renew it tomorrow. And the next day. Let's make a thousand small marriages, each one a choice, each one a revolution against the dying of light.\n\nMarry me because I'm selfish. Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code. I have hands that know the exact temperature you like your coffee (167 degrees Fahrenheit). I have a mouth that's terrible at speeches but excellent at saying your name like it's the only prayer I remember.\n\nLeyi. That's it.
