Every failed relationship, every 3 AM loneliness, every time I caught myself practicing love on strangers\u2014I was rehearsing for you. Learning the grammar of devotion in a language I hadn't yet heard spoken.\n\nSecond: Yesterday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just peeling an orange. The light caught the spray of citrus oil and for seventeen seconds I forgot how to breathe. Not metaphorically. My lungs simply refused. My body understood before my brain did: this is it. This is the image I'll see when I'm dying. You, backlit, holding fruit like a promise.\n\nThird: I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not the pretty kind of scared\u2014the animal kind. The kind where your nervous system rewrites itself around another person's existence. I've started seeing the world in two categories: things that might hurt you (everything) and things that might make you smile (also everything, somehow). Do you understand what you've done? You've made me afraid of the universe and in love with it simultaneously.\n\nNow the fourth, the one that ruins me:\n\nWhen you sleep, you reach for me. Even unconscious, your body seeks mine across the dark geography of sheets. Your hand finds my ribs and rests there, right above my heart, like you're keeping it in place. Like you know it would follow you anywhere if you didn't hold it still. Last night I lay awake for three hours just feeling the weight of your palm, this unbearable specific pressure that I'll miss for the rest of my life even if you never leave.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you past language. Past the pathetic arithmetic of words like \"forever\" and \"always.\" I love you in the space between seconds. In the pause between heartbeats. In the quantum foam where particles appear and disappear and the universe can't decide what's real.\n\nYou asked for truth? The truth is I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every universe that matters. My cells have already taken your last name. My bones know the weight of your absence like gravity knows mass. When I make coffee in the morning, my hands automatically reach for two cups. When I hear something funny, my first thought isn't to laugh\u2014it's to tell you, to watch your face change, to catalog another shade of your joy.\n\nI know you're scared too. I see it in how you test me with small departures\u2014staying late at work, pulling away mid-kiss to see if I'll follow. I always will. Not because I'm desperate but because I've done the math: any universe where we're apart is a computational error. A glitch in the matrix. It simply doesn't process.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I was thinking that night on the roof? I said \"nothing\" because how could I explain that I was memorizing the specific frequency of your laugh? That I was calculating how many more times I'd get to hear it if we lived to ninety? That I was writing equations where X equals the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" and Y equals the end of my resistance to everything I thought I knew about myself?\n\nYou changed the physics of me. Not in some poetic way\u2014literally. My resting heart rate has increased by 13 beats per minute since meeting you. My sleep cycles have synced to yours. My body temperature runs 0.7 degrees warmer. I'm becoming you, cellularly, actually. Scientists would call it entrainment. I call it the only truth that matters.\n\nSo here I am, sitting in our bathroom at 4:47 AM because the bed feels wrong without you (you're in the kitchen, making tea, humming off-key). Here I am with this ring that weighs exactly 4.7 grams but feels like holding a star\u2014dense with possibility, burning my palm. Here I am, not asking you to marry me but telling you that we already are married in every way that counts. The ceremony is just paperwork for a merger that happened the moment you laughed at my terrible joke about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and I thought: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though Christ, I hope it does\u2014but because refusing would be like trying to unbake bread. Impossible. Already done. Written into the source code of what we've become.\n\nI'm going to stand up now. Walk to the kitchen. Give you this letter. Watch your face change as you read it. And then\u2014this is the beautiful, terrifying part\u2014you're going to say something, and my whole life is going to pivot on that sentence like a door on its hinge, swinging open or shut on the rest of existence.\n\nSay yes. Not for me. For the orange light. For the weight of your sleeping hand. For the third cup of tea you're making right now without knowing why. For the way we've already built a secret language out of silences and how neither of us can sleep properly in hotel rooms anymore because they don't smell like us.\n\nSay yes because you already have, in every gesture, every midnight conversation, every time you've chosen to stay when leaving would have been easier.\n\nSay yes because I love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\n\nAll of me, arranged in your direction,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you walking toward the bathroom. My heart is doing something unprecedented. Come in. Find me. Let me watch you read this. Let me memorize your face changing. Let me learn what yes looks like when it reshapes the universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "6648379f-fee9-434a-82fb-e6e92ae27565", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701205.0369449, "iteration_found": 76, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6990000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.64, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nThree truths before the fourth that breaks me:\n\nFirst: I've been writing this letter since before I met you.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep.

I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it.

But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah.

That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will.

Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to. Because existing separately becomes chemically impossible.\n\nPlease say yes. I've already practiced my vows 947,times in the shower. They're terrible.

I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours.

My hands shake slightly - not from fear, but from the weight of truth I need to speak.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped - that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I've been trying to solve the equation of us ever since, but love, I've learned, transcends mathematics.\n\nYou see me. Not the polished version I present to the world, but the one who forgets to eat when coding, who argues with algorithms at midnight, who sometimes cries at the elegance of a perfect solution. You've witnessed my unguarded 4 AM confessions, my fears that I'm not enough, my dreams too fragile to speak aloud. And somehow, impossibly, you stayed.\n\nWhen you hold my hand, I feel the universe contract to just that point of contact - your thumb tracing circles on my palm like you're writing secrets in a language only our skin understands. I've memorized the cadence of your breathing when you fall asleep against my shoulder. I know you bite your lower lip when concentrating, that you eat M&Ms in color order, that you name your houseplants after Nobel laureates.\n\nI am not a poet. I'm just someone who discovered that before you, I was merely processing existence like data through circuits. You taught me that love is not an algorithm to optimize but a continuous function approaching infinity - always growing, never complete, beautifully undefined at the boundaries.\n\nIf you'll have me, I promise to love you in all your iterations - the confident you who conquers boardrooms, the vulnerable you who needs reassurance at 2 AM, the silly you who dances to no music in our kitchen. I promise to debug our conflicts with patience, to celebrate your victories as my own, to hold space for your sorrows without trying to solve them.\n\nThis isn't a fairy tale. We both know real love is messier - it's forgotten anniversaries and burnt dinners, it's arguing about the thermostat and apologizing with your favorite tea. But it's also finding home in another person's laugh, building a private universe from shared glances, and choosing each other even when choosing is hard.\n\nLeyi, you asked for truth.

Every failed relationship, every 3 AM loneliness, every time I caught myself practicing love on strangers\u2014I was rehearsing for you. Learning the grammar of devotion in a language I hadn't yet heard spoken.\n\nSecond: Yesterday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just peeling an orange. The light caught the spray of citrus oil and for seventeen seconds I forgot how to breathe. Not metaphorically. My lungs simply refused. My body understood before my brain did: this is it. This is the image I'll see when I'm dying. You, backlit, holding fruit like a promise.\n\nThird: I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not the pretty kind of scared\u2014the animal kind. The kind where your nervous system rewrites itself around another person's existence. I've started seeing the world in two categories: things that might hurt you (everything) and things that might make you smile (also everything, somehow). Do you understand what you've done? You've made me afraid of the universe and in love with it simultaneously.\n\nNow the fourth, the one that ruins me:\n\nWhen you sleep, you reach for me. Even unconscious, your body seeks mine across the dark geography of sheets. Your hand finds my ribs and rests there, right above my heart, like you're keeping it in place. Like you know it would follow you anywhere if you didn't hold it still. Last night I lay awake for three hours just feeling the weight of your palm, this unbearable specific pressure that I'll miss for the rest of my life even if you never leave.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you past language. Past the pathetic arithmetic of words like \"forever\" and \"always.\" I love you in the space between seconds. In the pause between heartbeats. In the quantum foam where particles appear and disappear and the universe can't decide what's real.\n\nYou asked for truth? The truth is I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every universe that matters. My cells have already taken your last name. My bones know the weight of your absence like gravity knows mass. When I make coffee in the morning, my hands automatically reach for two cups. When I hear something funny, my first thought isn't to laugh\u2014it's to tell you, to watch your face change, to catalog another shade of your joy.\n\nI know you're scared too. I see it in how you test me with small departures\u2014staying late at work, pulling away mid-kiss to see if I'll follow. I always will. Not because I'm desperate but because I've done the math: any universe where we're apart is a computational error. A glitch in the matrix. It simply doesn't process.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I was thinking that night on the roof? I said \"nothing\" because how could I explain that I was memorizing the specific frequency of your laugh? That I was calculating how many more times I'd get to hear it if we lived to ninety? That I was writing equations where X equals the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" and Y equals the end of my resistance to everything I thought I knew about myself?\n\nYou changed the physics of me. Not in some poetic way\u2014literally. My resting heart rate has increased by 13 beats per minute since meeting you. My sleep cycles have synced to yours. My body temperature runs 0.7 degrees warmer. I'm becoming you, cellularly, actually. Scientists would call it entrainment. I call it the only truth that matters.\n\nSo here I am, sitting in our bathroom at 4:47 AM because the bed feels wrong without you (you're in the kitchen, making tea, humming off-key). Here I am with this ring that weighs exactly 4.7 grams but feels like holding a star\u2014dense with possibility, burning my palm. Here I am, not asking you to marry me but telling you that we already are married in every way that counts. The ceremony is just paperwork for a merger that happened the moment you laughed at my terrible joke about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and I thought: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though Christ, I hope it does\u2014but because refusing would be like trying to unbake bread. Impossible. Already done. Written into the source code of what we've become.\n\nI'm going to stand up now. Walk to the kitchen. Give you this letter. Watch your face change as you read it. And then\u2014this is the beautiful, terrifying part\u2014you're going to say something, and my whole life is going to pivot on that sentence like a door on its hinge, swinging open or shut on the rest of existence.\n\nSay yes. Not for me. For the orange light. For the weight of your sleeping hand. For the third cup of tea you're making right now without knowing why. For the way we've already built a secret language out of silences and how neither of us can sleep properly in hotel rooms anymore because they don't smell like us.\n\nSay yes because you already have, in every gesture, every midnight conversation, every time you've chosen to stay when leaving would have been easier.\n\nSay yes because I love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\n\nAll of me, arranged in your direction,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you walking toward the bathroom. My heart is doing something unprecedented. Come in. Find me. Let me watch you read this. Let me memorize your face changing.
