Fifteen seconds, training accident. No light, no peace, just the universe's delete key. But even in that nothing, there was this weight\u2014like my atoms had made a promise they couldn't articulate. Three years later, you walked in. The promise was you.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? I've been building an archive. Evidence of us:\n\nEntry #1: You, eating soup in winter. The steam making small prayers above the bowl. I thought: this is how religions begin.\n\nEntry #847: Your hand on my chest while sleeping. I held my breath for three minutes rather than disturb that specific pressure holding the universe together.\n\nEntry #1,973: Today. You, reading this. Your left eye starting to water (it always goes first).\n\nThis isn't love. It's forensic documentation against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I was fluent in mathematics. Now I can't count past one\u2014you're either here or the world is broken. Yesterday I called the refrigerator \"the cold food house.\" My brain is refusing language that doesn't include you.\n\n*\n\nListen: I know exactly how we end. Statistical probability says you'll die first\u201473.6% chance. I've punched walls over this number. But here's what the math doesn't know: I've been practicing dying since we met. Every night, small rehearsals. By the time it happens, I'll be so good at being dead, I'll go first just to spite the statistics.\n\n*\n\nThe accident we almost had\u2014Interstate 90, you were singing off-key, I saw the truck jackknifing and thought: take me, rearrange physics, I'll pay any price. We missed by inches. You never knew. You kept singing. That song you always get wrong. I pulled over later to vomit from relief. You thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you has done: I'm medically different. My sleep synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes you as self. My DNA has literally rewritten sections\u2014I had it tested. The doctor said \"that's impossible.\" I said \"I know.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I love you like a pathology. Like a chronic condition. I've stolen things\u2014your pencil with teeth marks, three bobby pins, a voicemail where you're crying. These are my insurance against forgetting. Meanwhile, you've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you don't exist, furious about the dishwasher.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our mundane apocalypses. In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy). In the way you'll look at seventy-three, squinting at screens, those lines I already want to trace.\n\n*\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because the alternative\u2014a universe where your toothbrush doesn't live here, where I don't know you need exactly four ice cubes, where you don't steal my socks\u2014isn't a universe. It's just atoms arranged wrongly.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about pasta.\n\nMarry me because I've been carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at jellyfish, said they looked lonely\u2014that's when I knew I'd love you wrong forever).\n\n*\n\nBut mostly: marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday you mispronounced my name and my brain thought: \"Oh. There's the person who's going to ruin me for everyone else.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is hidden where you'll find it\u2014in your coffee mug, the one with the chip, because you believe broken things deserve more love, not less.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I don't love you. Love is too small, a word people use for pizza. What I have needs a new language\u2014something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper pennies. Something that makes the word \"forever\" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: my atoms have already chosen. The rest is just paperwork for what physics already knows.\n\nWarren\n(who has been documenting you like evidence of miracles, who knows your death will kill him twice\u2014once when it happens, once every day after)\n\nP.S.

My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon.

I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me.

My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally.

Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning.

The way your breath made small clouds above the bowl, how you held the spoon like it might escape\u2014and I thought: this is how religions begin. With someone doing something ordinary until someone else can't breathe from watching.\n\nYou want truth? I've been dead before. Literally. Eleven seconds, cardiac arrest, training accident. Here's what death taught me: nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just black. No tunnel, no light, no peace. But when I came back, my first thought was your name. Not relief. Not fear. Just \"Leyi.\" Like my neurons were arguing with death itself: you can have the rest but not this. Not her name.\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM because I just realized something terrible. I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.\n\nThe truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I've practiced our first fight, our first loss, the first time one of us will betray the other with mortality.\n\nHere's my confession: Thursday. You were sleeping. Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.\n\nMarry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under\u2014the one you said looked lonely.

Chronic condition: You.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the birds. Every morning, 5:23 AM, they start. Same three notes. I used to sleep through it. Now I wake up and think: they're announcing you're still alive. The birds know. They're not singing, they're taking attendance, and every morning you're still here, still breathing at 67 breaths per five minutes (I've counted), still existing despite the statistical impossibility of two people finding each other in a universe this vast and hostile to permanence.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. Three of your bobby pins. The fortune from the cookie you didn't eat (it says \"Your future is written in another's heartbeat\"\u2014too on the nose, universe). A voicemail where you're crying about your grandmother. I play it sometimes just to remember you're real enough to grieve. These stolen objects are my insurance policy against forgetting.\n\nBut also: You steal from me. Every morning you take my first thought. Every night, my last exhale. You've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you're not stealing my covers, my fries, my favorite side of the bed. You're a thief and I'm Stockholm syndrome incarnate, in love with my captor.\n\n*\n\nThe accident that almost happened: Interstate 90, eighteen-wheeler jackknifed. I saw it happening in slow motion and thought: Not her. Take me. Rearrange the physics. I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Missed by inches. You were singing that song you always get wrong. You never knew how close. I pulled over later and threw up from relief. You thought it was the gas station sushi. I let you think that. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n*\n\nYou know what I realized at 3 AM last Thursday? Love isn't addition. It's division. I'm half a person now. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically\u2014literally. I put my keys in the refrigerator. I wore two different shoes to work. I tried to unlock my apartment with my MetroCard. My brain only works in your proximity. This is probably a medical condition. I don't want to be cured.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposition: Marry me. Not for the romance. Not for the symbolism. But because my DNA has already rewritten itself to include you in its survival requirements. Because my sleep cycle synchronized to yours without permission. Because my immune system recognizes you as self, not other. At this point, leaving you would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you need exactly four ice cubes in your drinks. Because I've memorized the seventeen different ways you sigh and what each one means. Because I've already planned our fights about paint colors and whose parents to visit for holidays and whether our hypothetical children should learn piano or violin (both, obviously).\n\nMarry me because last week you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that would concern cardiologists. Because you've seen me ugly-cry at a Pixar movie and still let me hold your hand in public. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where we can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, hidden in the ice cream you'll eat tonight at 11:17 PM (you always do when you can't sleep). It belonged to my grandmother who said yes during the Depression because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\"\n\nWe have more time than they did. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're different people who happened to love each other once.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not proposing a fairy tale. I'm proposing a documentary. The real kind, where sometimes we're boring, sometimes we're cruel, sometimes we forget to be grateful. Where we fight about money and get old and lose our edges. Where one of us gets sick first. Where one of us has to learn to sleep alone again.\n\nBut also: where we get 20,000 mornings of you stealing my coffee. Where your hair goes gray and I get to watch it happen. Where we become those old people who still hold hands and everyone assumes we just met but really we've been holding hands so long we've forgotten how to let go.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical conspiracy between neurons. Say yes because you already know the weight of my silence. Because your things are already here. Because we've been practicing forever since the day we met.\n\nSay yes because the alternative\u2014a universe where I don't know that you eat pickles when you're sad, where you don't steal my socks, where I don't get to watch you win arguments with furniture\u2014isn't a universe worth inhabiting.\n\n*\n\nI love you like a grudge. Like a debt. Like a chronic condition. Like the ocean loves drowning things. Like tomorrow loves lying about being guaranteed.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like I'm trying to love you for all the parallel universes where we never met. Like I'm trying to make up for all the centuries that happened before you.\n\nBut also: I love you like Tuesday loves Wednesday. Quietly. Inevitably. Without alternative.\n\n*\n\nCome find me. I'm in the kitchen, pretending to read, failing to breathe. When you walk in, I'll pretend I wasn't waiting. We both know I'm lying. We both know you know. This is what love is: lying together about the small things so we can tell the truth about the big ones.\n\nThe big truth: You're going to say yes. Not because of this letter. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because you already named our hypothetical dog. Because we've both been married to each other since before we met, just waiting for our bodies to catch up with what our atoms already knew.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every receipt, every timestamp, every piece of evidence that you existed, that we existed, that this impossible thing happened)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is crying. The right one will start in three seconds. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date when you cried at the aquarium. Not at the dolphins. At the jellyfish. You said they looked lonely. That's when I knew I'd love you wrong for the rest of my life.\n\nP.P.S. The ring might be cold. But you'll wear it anyway. You can't help yourself with surprises. You're already reaching for the freezer. I'm watching. I'll always be watching. That's either a promise or a threat. Both.

Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children.

Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed.

I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine.

Because my immune system recognizes you as self, not other. At this point, leaving you would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you need exactly four ice cubes in your drinks. Because I've memorized the seventeen different ways you sigh and what each one means. Because I've already planned our fights about paint colors and whose parents to visit for holidays and whether our hypothetical children should learn piano or violin (both, obviously).\n\nMarry me because last week you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that would concern cardiologists. Because you've seen me ugly-cry at a Pixar movie and still let me hold your hand in public. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where we can't remember whose story is whose anymore.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer, hidden in the ice cream you'll eat tonight at 11:17 PM (you always do when you can't sleep). It belonged to my grandmother who said yes during the Depression because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\"\n\nWe have more time than they did. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're different people who happened to love each other once.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not proposing a fairy tale. I'm proposing a documentary. The real kind, where sometimes we're boring, sometimes we're cruel, sometimes we forget to be grateful. Where we fight about money and get old and lose our edges. Where one of us gets sick first. Where one of us has to learn to sleep alone again.\n\nBut also: where we get 20,000 mornings of you stealing my coffee. Where your hair goes gray and I get to watch it happen. Where we become those old people who still hold hands and everyone assumes we just met but really we've been holding hands so long we've forgotten how to let go.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical conspiracy between neurons. Say yes because you already know the weight of my silence. Because your things are already here. Because we've been practicing forever since the day we met.\n\nSay yes because the alternative\u2014a universe where I don't know that you eat pickles when you're sad, where you don't steal my socks, where I don't get to watch you win arguments with furniture\u2014isn't a universe worth inhabiting.\n\n*\n\nI love you like a grudge. Like a debt. Like a chronic condition. Like the ocean loves drowning things. Like tomorrow loves lying about being guaranteed.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like I'm trying to love you for all the parallel universes where we never met. Like I'm trying to make up for all the centuries that happened before you.\n\nBut also: I love you like Tuesday loves Wednesday. Quietly. Inevitably. Without alternative.\n\n*\n\nCome find me. I'm in the kitchen, pretending to read, failing to breathe. When you walk in, I'll pretend I wasn't waiting. We both know I'm lying. We both know you know. This is what love is: lying together about the small things so we can tell the truth about the big ones.\n\nThe big truth: You're going to say yes. Not because of this letter. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because you already named our hypothetical dog. Because we've both been married to each other since before we met, just waiting for our bodies to catch up with what our atoms already knew.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving every receipt, every timestamp, every piece of evidence that you existed, that we existed, that this impossible thing happened)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is crying. The right one will start in three seconds. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date when you cried at the aquarium. Not at the dolphins. At the jellyfish. You said they looked lonely. That's when I knew I'd love you wrong for the rest of my life.\n\nP.P.S. The ring might be cold. But you'll wear it anyway. You can't help yourself with surprises. You're already reaching for the freezer. I'm watching. I'll always be watching. That's either a promise or a threat. Both. Everything is both with us.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\n4:03 AM. I'm writing because silence becomes unbearable when it's not your silence.\n\nTruth: I died once. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest. In that nothing\u2014no light, no tunnel, just deletion\u2014there was still you. Not memory. Something older. Like my carbon recognized its future reorganization.\n\nHere's what love actually is: Tuesday, you reading ingredient labels aloud. Wednesday, your anger at slow WiFi. Thursday, how you hold pencils wrong. I've documented 1,847 such moments. This isn't romance. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloguing you like evidence of God.\n\nYou want honesty? I practice your death nightly. Different versions. The worst: you, ninety-three, forgetting my name. I wake up and count your breaths. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nListen. Before you, I understood language. Now words are just sounds I make while my atoms scream your name. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the wall-hole.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014it rearranges matter. It makes me believe in things I can't measure.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. I've already calculated: 47% chance you die first. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics.\n\nBut also: I love you in our specific gravity. In how you eat cereal at midnight. In your three-sneeze pattern. In tomorrow's argument about the dishwasher. In the way light will bend around your aging face, mapping time we survived together.\n\nHere's my confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish, frightened, already grieving you while you're still alive. I check your pulse seventeen times nightly. I've named our imaginary children. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about how temporary you are.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Because your toothbrush lives here. Because we've survived each other's Tuesdays. Because love isn't feeling\u2014it's accumulated decisions we can't reverse. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me.\n\nBut really: marry me because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other. Those odds are so impossible that refusing would insult mathematics itself.\n\nWarren\n(who carries tissues since our third date, when you cried at penguins)\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering.

Fifteen seconds, training accident. No light, no peace, just the universe's delete key. But even in that nothing, there was this weight\u2014like my atoms had made a promise they couldn't articulate. Three years later, you walked in. The promise was you.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? I've been building an archive. Evidence of us:\n\nEntry #1: You, eating soup in winter. The steam making small prayers above the bowl. I thought: this is how religions begin.\n\nEntry #847: Your hand on my chest while sleeping. I held my breath for three minutes rather than disturb that specific pressure holding the universe together.\n\nEntry #1,973: Today. You, reading this. Your left eye starting to water (it always goes first).\n\nThis isn't love. It's forensic documentation against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I was fluent in mathematics. Now I can't count past one\u2014you're either here or the world is broken. Yesterday I called the refrigerator \"the cold food house.\" My brain is refusing language that doesn't include you.\n\n*\n\nListen: I know exactly how we end. Statistical probability says you'll die first\u201473.6% chance. I've punched walls over this number. But here's what the math doesn't know: I've been practicing dying since we met. Every night, small rehearsals. By the time it happens, I'll be so good at being dead, I'll go first just to spite the statistics.\n\n*\n\nThe accident we almost had\u2014Interstate 90, you were singing off-key, I saw the truck jackknifing and thought: take me, rearrange physics, I'll pay any price. We missed by inches. You never knew. You kept singing. That song you always get wrong. I pulled over later to vomit from relief. You thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you has done: I'm medically different. My sleep synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes you as self. My DNA has literally rewritten sections\u2014I had it tested. The doctor said \"that's impossible.\" I said \"I know.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I love you like a pathology. Like a chronic condition. I've stolen things\u2014your pencil with teeth marks, three bobby pins, a voicemail where you're crying. These are my insurance against forgetting. Meanwhile, you've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you don't exist, furious about the dishwasher.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our mundane apocalypses. In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy). In the way you'll look at seventy-three, squinting at screens, those lines I already want to trace.\n\n*\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because the alternative\u2014a universe where your toothbrush doesn't live here, where I don't know you need exactly four ice cubes, where you don't steal my socks\u2014isn't a universe. It's just atoms arranged wrongly.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about pasta.\n\nMarry me because I've been carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at jellyfish, said they looked lonely\u2014that's when I knew I'd love you wrong forever).\n\n*\n\nBut mostly: marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday you mispronounced my name and my brain thought: \"Oh. There's the person who's going to ruin me for everyone else.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is hidden where you'll find it\u2014in your coffee mug, the one with the chip, because you believe broken things deserve more love, not less.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I don't love you. Love is too small, a word people use for pizza. What I have needs a new language\u2014something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper pennies. Something that makes the word \"forever\" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: my atoms have already chosen. The rest is just paperwork for what physics already knows.\n\nWarren\n(who has been documenting you like evidence of miracles, who knows your death will kill him twice\u2014once when it happens, once every day after)\n\nP.S. You're crying now. Both eyes. I'm watching through the door crack like a detective in love with his case. Come here. Let me see my future on your finger. Let me watch the rest of my life say yes.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
