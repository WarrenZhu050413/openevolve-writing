I burned them at 4:13 AM while you slept twenty-seven inches away, your left hand curled like a question mark against the pillow.\n\nTruth: I am clinically documenting our love because I don't trust memory. Tuesday, 9:47 PM: you sneezed mid-kiss. Wednesday, 2:15 AM: you said my name in your sleep like casting a spell. Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle. The way your spine curves slightly left when you're thinking hard. How your pupils dilate 2.3mm when you see dogs. I measure these things. I have spreadsheets. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm a case study in loving you wrong.\n\nBut also: when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one for strangers\u2014the sound reorganizes my DNA. I've tried to record it 1,247 times. The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.\n\n*\n\nThe mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:\n\nYour coffee: 167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.\nYour sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.\nYour tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.\nYour anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.\n\nI love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead. But in this one\u2014this impossible, statistically unlikely one\u2014you're reading this letter while I sit across from you, pretending to check my phone but actually watching the micro-expressions cross your face.\n\n3.7 seconds ago, your eyebrow twitched. That means you're about to cry.\n\n*\n\nI could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower\u2014yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine\u2014isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S. Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date, when you cried at that documentary about penguins. I knew then. I've known for 1,462 days. I'm just catching up to what my atoms decided the moment they sensed yours in the universe.\n\nP.P.S. Say yes. Or say no. Just say something.

It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first.

That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion).

Like my carbon knew its purpose before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth. Not beauty. So:\n\nI am not good at love. I do it wrong\u2014too much, too desperate. Like drowning people swim. Yesterday I calculated the probability you'll die first. The number made me punch a wall. This morning I apologized to the wall.\n\nI've deleted your number three times to stop myself texting. Called your provider to get it back. Dignity is a luxury I surrendered the moment you laughed at my terrible quantum physics joke.\n\n*\n\nBut also:\n\nI love you at 4 PM on Tuesdays. In your mispronunciation of \"specifically.\" In the 168\u00b0F you demand your coffee (you beautiful freak). In your mother's disappointment I'm not a doctor. In how you'll age\u2014I see it already in certain light, the map of our time together forming in advance.\n\nI know you were afraid of butterflies until age nine.\nI carry tissues because your left eye always cries first.\nThese are not metaphors.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I'm proposing:\n\nNot poetry. Not grand gesture. Just recognition that we've already chosen. Your toothbrush lives here. We've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Love isn't feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions. We've made most of them.\n\nThe question isn't whether you love me. It's whether you'll admit what we've already built.\n\n*\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.\n\nThe surgery would be fatal.\n\nWarren\n\n*\n\n(I know you're crying now.

My hands shake\u2014not from fear, but from the impossibility of translating what happens to my molecular structure when you exist in the same room.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not the symphony everyone promises. It's the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited, that little 'pacific' that somehow contains entire oceans. It's how you eat ice cream in winter because \"temperature is just a social construct,\" then steal my jacket anyway. It's the seventeen seconds every morning between when I wake and when I remember you're real, and how those seventeen seconds of forgetting make the remembering feel like winning the universe on repeat.\n\nI've been keeping inventory. Your laugh has forty-three distinct variations\u2014I've catalogued them all. The quiet library giggle. The sudden bark when I say something unexpectedly absurd. That rolling thunder when joy completely overtakes you. Number thirty-seven is my favorite: the silent shoulder-shake when you're trying not to wake me, not knowing I'm already awake, memorizing the rhythm of your happiness.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter 200 times in my head, deleted 199 for containing the word \"soul.\" I'm terrified that I love you more than you love me, and equally terrified of the opposite. When you had the flu last March, I googled \"can you die from someone else's fever\" because your suffering felt like mine but worse\u2014mine I could bear, yours rewired my understanding of unbearable.\n\nBut here's the thing about truth\u2014it's smaller than we think. It's not \"I would die for you\" (though I would). It's \"I'll kill the spiders even though I'm also afraid.\" It's not \"you complete me.\" It's \"before you, I never noticed I was incomplete.\" It's this: when I imagine different futures, you're the only constant that doesn't feel like a limitation but like the opposite\u2014like suddenly having infinite variables because with you, even the ordinary becomes unprecedented.\n\nI could tell you about the Sunday you cried at the ending of that ridiculous movie about penguins, how your empathy for animated birds made me want to be worthy of living on the same planet. I could map the constellation of freckles on your left shoulder (Orion's belt, but better). I could confess that I've already planned our arguments twenty years from now, and how even in imagination, your angry face makes me want to kiss you until we forget what we were fighting about.\n\nInstead, I'll tell you this: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity, or the speed of light\u2014something fundamental that doesn't require belief to be true. I love you at the quantum level, where observation changes everything and nothing simultaneously. I love you past the heat death of the universe, which sounds like hyperbole but feels like underselling it.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know that tomorrow without you is just time, not a future. Marry me because we've already started forever; I'm just asking for the paperwork. Marry me because when I say your name, even in my head, my mouth makes the shape of home.\n\nYours in this universe and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. \u2013 If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to learn interpretive dance.

It's terrifying. It's me at twenty-three thinking I understood the world until you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized sweater and suddenly every poem I'd ever read was kindergarten nonsense. It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore. The surgery would kill me.\n\nWith all my atoms, retroactively and forever,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. Your left eye first, always. I have tissues in my pocket.

Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater lie than any failed attempt at truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound reorganized the atoms of my universe. I've been trying to make you laugh ever since, not for the joke itself, but to witness that precise tilt of your head, the way your left eye crinkles slightly more than your right, how you cover your mouth as if beauty could be hidden.\n\nI love you in the ordinary moments\u2014when you forget I'm watching and become entirely yourself. The way you bite your lower lip reading difficult passages. How you unconsciously hum that melody from your childhood when you cook. The fierce concentration when you're solving problems, as if the world depends on it. Perhaps mine does.\n\nYou asked for truth. Here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing. I'm terrified of not being enough, of my words falling short, of time being finite when what I feel for you demands eternity. Some nights I lie awake calculating the hours we have left if we live to eighty, and the number always feels like theft.\n\nBut then morning comes, and you're there, and your presence makes cowards of my fears. We build our small forevers in coffee conversations, in shared silences that speak volumes, in the way our hands find each other without looking. You've taught me that love isn't a grand gesture but a thousand tiny choices to turn toward each other.\n\nI cannot promise you perfection. I can promise that when the world feels too heavy, I'll help you carry it. When joy arrives, I'll celebrate with you as if we've won the universe. When you doubt yourself, I'll be your mirror, reflecting back the brilliant truth of who you are.\n\nMarry me, not because I've written pretty words, but because you already know the answer in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before sleep when pretense falls away.

I want to sue the universe for this number.\n\nYou want truth? I practice your death in my dreams. Every night. Different versions. Car accidents, diseases with Latin names, sudden disappearances where you simply vanish like a quantum particle nobody was observing. I wake up and check your breathing. Count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three\u2014there. There you are. Still real. Still impossible.\n\nI loved you before I met you. This sounds insane. It is insane. But on March 15th, 2019, three years before we met, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body.\" That was you. You were already changing me before you existed in my life. How do you explain that to physics?\n\nListen. I'm bad at this. I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then discover I'm just a collection of anxieties wearing a human suit. That I check if you're breathing seventeen times a night. That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion). You know that when you had the flu, I googled \"how to transfer illness from one person to another\" because I wanted to take it from you.\n\nHere's my proposal: Marry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is a lie we tell because the truth is unbearable. Marry me for the next twenty-four hours. Then let's renew it tomorrow. And the next day. Let's make a thousand small marriages, each one a choice, each one a revolution against the dying of light.\n\nMarry me because I'm selfish. Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code. I have hands that know the exact temperature you like your coffee (167 degrees Fahrenheit). I have a mouth that's terrible at speeches but excellent at saying your name like it's the only prayer I remember.\n\nLeyi. That's it.

Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind.

You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower\u2014yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine\u2014isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S.
