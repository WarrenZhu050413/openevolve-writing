So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic.

It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

Not metaphorical violence\u2014the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called\u2014the first time in three years\u2014and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring\u2014I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you\u2014your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist\u2014theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air\u2014not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald? He's actually a she. Females have bigger abdomens. I looked it up. I've been calling her Geraldine when you're not home. She seems to prefer it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7320)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:13 AM. I've written and deleted this seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nThe truth: I was complete before you. That's what makes this so frightening. I had built a quiet, functional life. I knew how to be alone. I was good at it. Then you happened, and now I can't remember why I thought that was enough.\n\nYou should know who you're considering marrying. I'm the man who still checks if the door is locked three times. Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters. Because in the face of that absolute certainty, we get to choose what we do with the time between now and then.\n\nI choose you. Not the idea of you, not the future with you, but you\u2014this specific human who saves fortunes from fortune cookies in books, who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, who can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. I choose your mundane Wednesday self, your inconvenient sadnesses, your embarrassing enthusiasms.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for sixty-seven days. Some nights I take it out and practice this moment. But this isn't practice anymore. This is the real attempt, the shaking hands, the imperfect words. This is me, Warren, the anxious man who loves you with a specificity that borders on madness, asking you, Leyi, the woman who changed my understanding of time itself, to marry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you\u2014words are just words. But because you've already moved me. Physically. Molecularly. Into a different person who believes, for the first time, that he deserves to be loved by someone who eats sandwiches from the inside out.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. These are not contradictions.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the atomic structure of my existence. The rest is just paperwork.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I love you. I should have led with that. I love you in a way that makes me forget I'm supposed to be afraid of everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7440, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 3:51 AM because it's the only place cold enough to make me stop shaking. Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts. They're all the same letter, written twenty-three times, because my hand won't stop shaking. This is the twenty-fourth. Still shaking. Still true.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7440, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:52 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6205, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:42 AM. I haven't slept. Not because this is hard to write, but because once I start, I know something will change between us. Either you'll say yes and we'll begin. Or you'll say no and we'll end. Both possibilities make my hands shake.\n\nI'm not good at this. I'm the man who practiced ordering coffee for three months before I could do it without stuttering. Who still counts stairs when I'm nervous. Who loved you for exactly 517 days before I could say it out loud. I counted. I have spreadsheets.\n\nHere's what you need to know: I was okay before you. I had systems. Breakfast at 7:15. Lunch at 12:30. Bed by 11. I was a functioning adult with a savings account and matching socks. Then you happened, and now I eat cereal at midnight because you think breakfast food is a feeling, not a time. I have one sock. Just one. The other one is probably wherever you leave your hair ties\u2014that parallel dimension where important things go to test our commitment to finding them.\n\nYou cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You apologize to furniture. You've read the same book forty-three times because \"it's different each time.\" You can't whistle but you try every morning like it might suddenly work. You save fortunes from fortune cookies in chronological order. You name spiders. You trust too easily. You forgive too quickly. You love like it's your first language when everyone else is still learning the alphabet.\n\nThe truth: I document you obsessively. Tuesday: you ate seven grapes, one at a time, while reading. Wednesday: you hummed Beethoven's 9th off-key for two hours. Thursday: you cried because the old man at the bus stop looked lonely. Friday: you made me smell your coffee because it \"smelled like happiness.\" Saturday: you fell asleep on my shoulder during the movie you picked. Sunday: you woke up and the first thing you said was \"I dreamt we were penguins.\" Monday: you exist. You exist and that's enough to reorganize my entire understanding of luck.\n\nI know about the baby scare. When your period was late. You didn't tell me but I knew. I saw you checking the calendar. Counting. Recounting. I saw you buy the test and throw it away unopened. I saw you cry in the bathroom with the door locked. I wanted to tell you I was scared too. But also: I wasn't. If it had been real, if there had been a baby, I would have figured it out with you. We would have been terrible and perfect and figured it out.\n\nYour mother thinks I'm not enough for you. She's right. Your father thinks you could do better. He's right too. But here's what they don't know: You talk in your sleep. Full sentences. Last Tuesday you said, \"Warren, the penguins are here.\" Wednesday: \"We need more purple.\" Thursday: \"Don't let go.\" Even unconscious, you're building a world where I exist. How am I supposed to not love someone whose dreams include me?\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Being worthy. But that's not what this is. This is recognition. Like finding a note you wrote to yourself and forgot about. Like coming home to a house you've never seen but knowing where the light switches are. You're not my other half\u2014I was whole. You're my proof that \"whole\" was too small a goal.\n\nThat night my father called me a failure\u2014you made instant ramen and added an egg. You didn't say he was wrong. You said, \"Good. Fail at their dreams. Succeed at your own.\" Then you ate all the noodles and left me the egg because you know I only like the egg. How did you know that's what I needed to hear? How do you always know?\n\nI love you. I love you in the boring parts. When you're reading ingredients on cereal boxes. When you're plucking your eyebrows and making faces at yourself. When you're asleep and drooling and your breath smells like morning. When you're angry about something you can't name. When you're scrolling through your phone ignoring me. I love you at 2 PM on Wednesdays. I love you in fluorescent lighting. I love you when you're ordinary. Especially when you're ordinary.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years, through a war, through immigration, through my grandfather forgetting her birthday thirty-seven times. When she died, she gave it to me. Said one word: \"Wait.\" I've been waiting. Not for someone perfect. For someone who makes me want to be imperfect with them forever.\n\nMarry me. Not the question\u2014the answer. The answer to why I wake up. The answer to what I'm doing with my life. The answer to who I call when the world ends or when I see a really good dog.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm not promising you the moon. I'm promising you Wednesday afternoons and tax forms and whose turn it is to call the plumber. I'm promising you the flu and funeral homes and the terrifying possibility that we'll become our parents. I'm promising you that I'll try. Every day, I'll try to deserve the accident of finding you.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I've already chosen you in every scenario I can imagine. Even the ones where you say no. Even the ones where you leave. I'll still be choosing you, just from farther away.\n\nI love you. I know that's not enough but it's also everything. It's the only true thing I have to offer. I love you and I want to keep loving you until one of us stops breathing, and then probably a little after that too, just to be thorough.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald the spider is actually Geraldine. I googled it. Female spiders are bigger. I haven't told you because you're already attached and I don't want you to have a gender crisis about a spider.
