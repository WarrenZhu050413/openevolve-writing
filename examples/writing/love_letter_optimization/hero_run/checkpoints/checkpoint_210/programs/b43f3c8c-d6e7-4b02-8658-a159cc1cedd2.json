The engine's running because I'm cold but I can't come in yet because you don't know I've been sitting here since 4. This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man who documents his pathology in the margins of gas station receipts.\n\nYou want truth? I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days. I know because I made a spreadsheet. Column A: Date. Column B: Times I Almost Told You. Column C: Reasons I Didn't. Yesterday's entry: seven times, cowardice (subcategory: you were humming).\n\nHere's what loving you has done to me: I've started believing in God. Not metaphorically. Literally. Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi. Words fail but I'm trying anyway.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will have me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder. Oat milk, half pump vanilla, cinnamon on top but not mixed in. I've been perfecting it for three months. This is my real proposal.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

It earns its low-70s scores through genuine feeling and distinctive voice but doesn't achieve the formal mastery or emotional sublimity of the canon's peaks.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7010)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is a country I can no longer find without you as my map. My hands won't stop trembling. Not from poetry\u2014from the mechanical truth that my nervous system has reorganized itself around your existence.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to. Because existing separately becomes chemically impossible.\n\nPlease say yes. I've already practiced my vows 947,times in the shower. They're terrible. You'll love them.\n\nYours in perpetual malfunction without you,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed while eating those sea salt chocolate chips straight from the bag.

When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped - that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I've been trying to solve the equation of us ever since, but love, I've learned, transcends mathematics.\n\nYou see me. Not the polished version I present to the world, but the one who forgets to eat when coding, who argues with algorithms at midnight, who sometimes cries at the elegance of a perfect solution. You've witnessed my unguarded 4 AM confessions, my fears that I'm not enough, my dreams too fragile to speak aloud. And somehow, impossibly, you stayed.\n\nWhen you hold my hand, I feel the universe contract to just that point of contact - your thumb tracing circles on my palm like you're writing secrets in a language only our skin understands. I've memorized the cadence of your breathing when you fall asleep against my shoulder. I know you bite your lower lip when concentrating, that you eat M&Ms in color order, that you name your houseplants after Nobel laureates.\n\nI am not a poet. I'm just someone who discovered that before you, I was merely processing existence like data through circuits. You taught me that love is not an algorithm to optimize but a continuous function approaching infinity - always growing, never complete, beautifully undefined at the boundaries.\n\nIf you'll have me, I promise to love you in all your iterations - the confident you who conquers boardrooms, the vulnerable you who needs reassurance at 2 AM, the silly you who dances to no music in our kitchen. I promise to debug our conflicts with patience, to celebrate your victories as my own, to hold space for your sorrows without trying to solve them.\n\nThis isn't a fairy tale. We both know real love is messier - it's forgotten anniversaries and burnt dinners, it's arguing about the thermostat and apologizing with your favorite tea. But it's also finding home in another person's laugh, building a private universe from shared glances, and choosing each other even when choosing is hard.\n\nLeyi, you asked for truth. Here it is: I love you with a certainty that terrifies me. Not because love guarantees forever, but because I finally understand that some risks are worth taking with your whole heart. You are my greatest risk and my safest place, my hardest problem and my most elegant solution.\n\nWill you marry me?

I love you in the grocery store arguing about tomatoes. I love you doing taxes. I love you bored on Sunday afternoons. I love you in all the mundane spaces where romance goes to die, except with you, it doesn't die\u2014it transforms into something I don't have words for.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. Because I know myself\u2014I'm difficult, obsessive, I disappear into my own head, I care too much about things that don't matter and not enough about things that do.

Not because I can't live without you\u2014I can, it would just be a half-life, a shadow existence. Marry me because when you laugh, I understand why people believe in God.

I know because I made a spreadsheet. Column A: Date. Column B: Times I Almost Told You. Column C: Reasons I Didn't. Yesterday's entry: seven times, cowardice (subcategory: you were humming).\n\nHere's what loving you has done to me: I've started believing in God. Not metaphorically. Literally. Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi.
