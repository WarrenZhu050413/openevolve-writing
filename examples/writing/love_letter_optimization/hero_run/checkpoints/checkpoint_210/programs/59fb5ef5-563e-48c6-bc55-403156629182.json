That I catch myself smiling at my phone like an idiot when you text about your terrible cafeteria lunch?\n\nRemember that Tuesday when you fell asleep on my shoulder during that documentary about penguins? You drooled a little. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went completely numb, and it was the most content I've ever been. That's when I knew\u2014not in some grand romantic revelation, but in that quiet, ridiculous moment\u2014that I wanted every mundane Tuesday with you.\n\nYou make me brave in small ways. I tried sushi because you love it (still hate uni, sorry). I started reading your favorite poet (still don't understand most of it, but I love how your eyes light up explaining it). You've turned me into someone who notices things: how you bite your lip when you're concentrating, how you always save the best bite for last, how you get genuinely upset when plants die.\n\nI'm not good with words like this. I'm an engineer; I think in systems and logic. But you've introduced chaos theory into my ordered world, and somehow everything makes more sense now. You're my favorite contradiction\u2014fiercely independent but terrible at opening jars, brilliantly analytical but cries at pet adoption commercials, claims to hate mornings but always steals my coffee.\n\nI don't promise you the moon or eternal flames or whatever poets promise. I promise to kill spiders even though they terrify me too. I promise to always let you have the last dumpling. I promise to learn your mother's recipe for that soup you miss. I promise to remind you that you're brilliant when imposter syndrome hits. I promise to be the person who knows you forgot to eat when you're stressed and shows up with your favorite takeout.\n\nThis isn't a perfect letter. But it's true. You asked for truth, so here it is: you've become the constant in all my equations, the hypothesis I never want to disprove. I love you in the most ordinary, extraordinary way\u2014desperately, daily, and with terrible jokes included.\n\nMarry me?
