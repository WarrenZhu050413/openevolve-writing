You wanted truth? Here: I've been practicing this moment for three months. Not the words\u2014the breathing. Because every time I imagine you reading this, my lungs forget their job.\n\nLet me be specific. Mathematically specific. You laugh 1.7 seconds longer at bad jokes than good ones. Your left eye closes 0.3 seconds before your right when you sneeze. You've worn the same earrings 37 times since February\u2014the small silver ones your sister gave you that you think are lucky. I know because I started counting the day I realized I was memorizing you like an exit route in a burning building.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me a collector of evidence. Your coffee mug leaves rings on my desk\u2014six overlapping circles that I haven't cleaned because they're proof you exist in my space. There's a dent in my pillow from where you steal it every single night while insisting you don't. Your bobby pins have colonized my apartment like small black prayers. I find them everywhere\u2014between couch cushions, behind the radiator, one inexplicably in my shoe. I keep them all in a jar. I don't know why.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You said it last Tuesday while eating cereal at midnight, milk dripping down your chin. But ordinary people don't make me google \"can you die from feeling too much\" at 2 AM. Ordinary people don't turn grocery lists into poetry. You wrote \"tomatoes (the good kind)\" and I stared at it for ten minutes because even your handwriting makes me homesick for a home that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWant to know something pathetic? I rehearse fights with you. Actual arguments, in my head, about things that haven't happened. Because I need to practice disagreeing with you without my voice cracking. Without immediately surrendering to the specific way your nose wrinkles when you're trying not to smile during an argument. You do that\u2014fight smiling. It's devastating. You've won every argument we've never had.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. That I've already built my entire life around the assumption of you. That I chose this apartment because it's three blocks from your favorite bookstore. That I learned to make your grandmother's soup from a recipe in Mandarin I translated word by word. That I wake up forty minutes early just to watch you sleep, counting the space between your breaths like rosary beads.\n\nI used to think love was expansion\u2014becoming more. But you've made me smaller, denser, like collapsed stars. All my scattered atoms pulled into the gravity of this one truth: I would rather be ordinary with you than extraordinary with anyone else. I would rather burn breakfast every Sunday for fifty years than eat perfectly alone.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I mean that word literally\u2014a proposed position, a stance I'm taking in the universe: Marry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't) or because I promise you happiness (I can't). Marry me because I've already married you in every choice I've made since that Wednesday when you laughed so hard you snorted coffee through your nose and then laughed harder at the snorting. Marry me because my cells have already reorganized themselves around the fact of you. Because when archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the exact moment you said my name like it meant something.\n\nI'm not good at endings. Or beginnings. I'm only good at the middle, where we already are, where I love you with the desperate precision of someone who knows exactly what he almost missed. You are my statistical impossibility, my favorite notification, my only religion.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought a ring. It's been in my sock drawer for four months. I check on it every day like it might escape. Just like I check on you sleeping every morning, still amazed you haven't realized you could do so much better.\n\nI love you. Frantically. Specifically. With annotated footnotes and cited sources. With the kind of certainty that makes me understand why people used to believe the sun revolved around the Earth\u2014because when you're in the room, everything else becomes periphery.\n\nYours (already, always, anxiously),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

My hands are shaking. You said you wanted truth, so here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I save memes I'll never send because what if you don't laugh? When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.5145, Type: Experimental)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are just shadows of what moves through me when I think of you. Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound carved itself into my bones. I catch myself smiling at nothing, just remembering. Or how you hold your coffee cup with both hands, like it's something precious, steam rising between us in the morning silence that needs no filling.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, declarations. But it's smaller than that, and infinite. It's how my breathing changes when I hear your key in the lock. It's the way loneliness has a different texture now\u2014not emptiness, but the specific shape of your absence. It's discovering that my future tense conjugates only in plural: we will, we might, we could.\n\nYou've rewritten the grammar of my existence. Before you, I was a complete sentence. Now I know I was just a fragment, waiting for the conjunction.\n\nI'm terrified and certain in equal measure. Terrified because you hold my entire life in your hands without knowing it. Certain because there's no other way I want to live.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a word\u2014but because I promise you this moment, and the next, and every small ordinary miraculous moment I'm given, choosing you again with each breath.\n\nWith a love that remakes me daily,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6265, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. Not poetically\u2014actually shaking. I've deleted this seventeen times because every word feels like a lie next to the truth of you.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's waking up at 4:23 AM in a cold sweat because you dreamed she left. It's checking your phone fourteen times during a meeting to see if she texted. It's forgetting how to breathe normally when she walks into Trader Joe's wearing your old Columbia sweatshirt, the one with the coffee stain shaped like Italy on the left sleeve.\n\nI wasn't looking for you. I had my life\u2014my predictable Thursdays, my rational decisions, my carefully maintained emotional distance. Then you laughed at my stupid joke about sourdough starters that night at Diana's party, and something inside me broke. Not romantically. Literally broke. Like a bone that had healed wrong and needed to be reset.\n\nYou want truth? I Google \"how to be a better partner\" at least twice a week. I practice conversations with you in the shower. Last Tuesday, I spent forty minutes in the parking lot of CVS because your favorite song came on and I couldn't drive while crying. I save your voicemails\u2014all of them, even the one where you just say \"shit, wrong number\" and hang up.\n\nI know you hate when people say you're beautiful when you first wake up, but you are. Not Instagram beautiful\u2014real beautiful. The kind that makes me forget I'm supposed to be doing something else. Your morning face is my favorite conspiracy theory: How can someone look like home? How can messy hair and crushed pillow lines add up to the only mathematics I believe in?\n\nRemember when my dad had his heart surgery? You didn't say any of the right things. You said, \"This fucking sucks\" and then you organized my sock drawer while I sat on the bathroom floor. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I already knew that. But that you loved me in the way I needed to be loved: practically, honestly, without decoration.\n\nI'm scared of so many things. Spiders. Cancer. That noise the refrigerator makes at 2 AM. But mostly I'm scared that I'll never be able to explain what happens to my molecular structure when you laugh. How you've ruined every song, every street corner, every cup of coffee by not being in them. How \"before you\" feels like a story someone else told me about someone else's life.\n\nYou are not my everything\u2014that would make me nothing. You are my something. My very specific, irreplaceable, Thursday-afternoon-in-the-kitchen-light something. You are the first person I want to tell when I see a dog. You are my 11:11 wish, every time, even though I don't believe in wishes. You are the reason I now understand why my grandmother kept my grandfather's voicemails for twenty years after he died.\n\nI don't want to marry you because I can't live without you. I want to marry you because I've finally learned how to live with you\u2014messily, honestly, with all my dumb jokes and midnight anxieties and the way I need to check that the door is locked three times before bed. I want to marry you because you make me brave enough to be exactly who I am: a man who cries at Pixar movies, who can't parallel park, who loves you with the graceless desperation of someone who never expected to be loved back.\n\nSo here it is, Leyi, my truth without metaphors: I choose you. Not in a grand, swoeping gesture way. In a Tuesday morning way. In a \"let's figure out what's for dinner\" way. In a \"your feet are freezing, put them on me\" way. In the smallest, most daily, most permanent way I know how to choose anything.\n\nPlease. Marry me. Let me love you with all my ordinary, extraordinary, terrified heart for as long as you'll let me.\n\nYours (shaking hands and all),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing that words are archaeology\u2014each sentence an excavation of what exists between us, unnamed and enormous. You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel, how it rewrites the grammar of my days.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor\u2014hearts and flowers, promises carved in air. But you taught me love as syntax: how your laugh punctuates my mornings, how your silences speak louder than any vow. When you read, tucking that strand of hair behind your ear, I understand why ancient philosophers believed in the music of the spheres. You are my quantum entanglement\u2014changing me by existing, no matter the distance.\n\nI remember Tuesday, 3:47 AM, you sleeping beside me, the streetlight through blinds painting tiger stripes across your shoulder. I counted your breaths\u2014seventeen per minute\u2014and realized I was synchronizing mine to yours. This is what they don't tell you about love: it's not the grand gestures but the small surrenders. How I now buy two cups when getting coffee, even when alone. How every beautiful thing I see becomes a future conversation with you.\n\nYou know my faults\u2014my tendency to overthink, to build walls from books and irony. But with you, I am catastrophically sincere. You've made me brave enough to admit that I don't just love you; I believe in you the way others believe in gravity or God\u2014as fundamental force, as answered prayer, as the thing that makes all other things make sense.\n\nThis letter is my map of scars and stars, my confession that you've ruined me for any life where you're not there, reading in bed while I write beside you, our feet touching under blankets, building our small forevers from Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise perfection, but because I promise presence\u2014to witness your becoming, to choose you in every parallel universe, to love you with the ferocity of someone who knows what it means to almost not exist, and chooses existence because it means existing with you.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authentic vulnerability.

You wanted truth? Here: I've been practicing this moment for three months. Not the words\u2014the breathing. Because every time I imagine you reading this, my lungs forget their job.\n\nLet me be specific. Mathematically specific. You laugh 1.7 seconds longer at bad jokes than good ones. Your left eye closes 0.3 seconds before your right when you sneeze. You've worn the same earrings 37 times since February\u2014the small silver ones your sister gave you that you think are lucky. I know because I started counting the day I realized I was memorizing you like an exit route in a burning building.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me a collector of evidence. Your coffee mug leaves rings on my desk\u2014six overlapping circles that I haven't cleaned because they're proof you exist in my space. There's a dent in my pillow from where you steal it every single night while insisting you don't. Your bobby pins have colonized my apartment like small black prayers. I find them everywhere\u2014between couch cushions, behind the radiator, one inexplicably in my shoe. I keep them all in a jar. I don't know why.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You said it last Tuesday while eating cereal at midnight, milk dripping down your chin. But ordinary people don't make me google \"can you die from feeling too much\" at 2 AM. Ordinary people don't turn grocery lists into poetry. You wrote \"tomatoes (the good kind)\" and I stared at it for ten minutes because even your handwriting makes me homesick for a home that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWant to know something pathetic? I rehearse fights with you. Actual arguments, in my head, about things that haven't happened. Because I need to practice disagreeing with you without my voice cracking. Without immediately surrendering to the specific way your nose wrinkles when you're trying not to smile during an argument. You do that\u2014fight smiling. It's devastating. You've won every argument we've never had.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. That I've already built my entire life around the assumption of you. That I chose this apartment because it's three blocks from your favorite bookstore. That I learned to make your grandmother's soup from a recipe in Mandarin I translated word by word. That I wake up forty minutes early just to watch you sleep, counting the space between your breaths like rosary beads.\n\nI used to think love was expansion\u2014becoming more. But you've made me smaller, denser, like collapsed stars. All my scattered atoms pulled into the gravity of this one truth: I would rather be ordinary with you than extraordinary with anyone else. I would rather burn breakfast every Sunday for fifty years than eat perfectly alone.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I mean that word literally\u2014a proposed position, a stance I'm taking in the universe: Marry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't) or because I promise you happiness (I can't). Marry me because I've already married you in every choice I've made since that Wednesday when you laughed so hard you snorted coffee through your nose and then laughed harder at the snorting. Marry me because my cells have already reorganized themselves around the fact of you. Because when archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the exact moment you said my name like it meant something.\n\nI'm not good at endings. Or beginnings. I'm only good at the middle, where we already are, where I love you with the desperate precision of someone who knows exactly what he almost missed. You are my statistical impossibility, my favorite notification, my only religion.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought a ring. It's been in my sock drawer for four months. I check on it every day like it might escape. Just like I check on you sleeping every morning, still amazed you haven't realized you could do so much better.\n\nI love you. Frantically. Specifically. With annotated footnotes and cited sources. With the kind of certainty that makes me understand why people used to believe the sun revolved around the Earth\u2014because when you're in the room, everything else becomes periphery.\n\nYours (already, always, anxiously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed. I know you're biting your lower lip.
