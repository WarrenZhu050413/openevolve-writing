You haven't noticed.\n  \n- Last Thursday, you cried about extinct butterflies for forty minutes.\n  You weren't crying about butterflies.\n  Your period was late. Neither of us was ready.\n  When it came, we pretended nothing happened.\n  But I went to the bathroom and thanked a god I don't believe in\n  while simultaneously mourning something that never existed.\n  This is what you've done to me\u2014\n  I now hold multiple impossibilities as truth.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I was clean lines and locked doors.\nI was pleased with my own company.\nI had systems.\nI was so boring I could have lived forever.\n\nAfter you:\nI eat ice cream at 3 AM while googling \"how to deserve someone.\"\nI practice conversations with you in the shower,\nlose every argument,\nand still come out thinking I've won something.\nI write your name on fogged windows then panic\nthat someone will see it and steal you.\nI am ruined for all other humans.\nThey speak and I think: That's not how Leyi would say it.\nThey laugh and I think: Leyi's laugh could resurrect the dead.\nThey exist and I think: But are they Leyi?

I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic.

It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

Not metaphorical violence\u2014the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called\u2014the first time in three years\u2014and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring\u2014I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you\u2014your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist\u2014theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air\u2014not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:01 AM now. The world is starting to lie again. But this won't change: You are the truest thing that has ever happened to me. You are what makes the dying worth it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Performs well on combined_score (0.7355), Performs well on phenomenological_authenticity (0.7700), Performs well on aesthetic_virtuosity (0.7100), Performs well on affective_force (0.7400), Performs well on literary_innovation (0.6800), Performs well on letter_text (Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop trembling.

Not because I'm romantic. Because I can't sleep when something this important needs saying.\n\nTwenty-three drafts sit in my trash. Here's attempt twenty-four.\n\nThe truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because \"I love you\" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald? He's actually a she. Females have bigger abdomens. I looked it up. I've been calling her Geraldine when you're not home.

They don't know you eat mangoes in the bathtub. They've never watched you forgive me for things I couldn't forgive myself for.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need you to believe it: I don't love you because you're perfect. I love you because you're Leyi. The one who keeps dead flowers. Who assigns personalities to kitchen appliances. Who still calls your dead grandmother's phone to hear her voicemail. These aren't quirks. They're coordinates. They're how I find you in the dark.\n\nListen. Before you, I had sex. With you, I learned about skin. The spot behind your ear that makes you stop talking mid-sentence. Your wrist\u2014just the inside of your wrist\u2014how it smells like bread and rain. Sometimes you fall asleep holding my hand and I stay awake feeling your pulse. Sixty-eight beats per minute. I've timed it. That's the speed of my religion now.\n\nYou're scared you're not enough. Leyi\u2014you apologized to me for crying when your mother forgot your birthday. You apologized. For having feelings about being forgotten. That's when I knew: you've been taught to make yourself small. But then you sing in the shower\u2014off-key, loud, forgetting half the words\u2014and I think: there she is. There's the person before the world taught her to apologize for existing.\n\nMy father is dying. Actually dying. Pancreatic cancer. Three months, maybe four. Yesterday he said, \"At least you found her.\" Not \"I love you.\" Not \"I'm proud.\" Just \"At least you found her.\" He's never met you but he knows. When a cynical man acknowledges miracles, you pay attention.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. It's not. It's about choosing. And I choose you when you're sobbing about the ending of books. I choose you when you're silent for three days and I don't know why. I choose you when you laugh so hard you snort and then get embarrassed about snorting which makes you snort more. I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means\u2014not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me\u2014you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one. The one who can't whistle. Who puts salt on watermelon. Who still sleeps with a stuffed elephant named Chairman Mao. I'll take all of it, all of you, forever or until one of us stops breathing\u2014whichever comes first.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double. When the world feels impossible, I'll make you toast\u2014butter all the way to the edges\u2014and we'll be impossible together.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: You've already changed me at a molecular level. My DNA has rewritten itself around the fact of you. You're not just in my heart\u2014you're in my cells, my synapses, the calcium of my bones. Leaving you would require surgery I wouldn't survive.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Actually. The way lungs love air\u2014desperately, constantly, without thought or choice.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:24 AM now. I've been writing this for an hour and eleven minutes. That's 4,260 seconds of trying to explain something that exists outside of time. This is the longest I've ever gone without checking if you're still breathing. I'm going to submit this now, then come back to bed and watch you sleep until the sun comes up. That's my favorite kind of morning\u2014the kind where you're still here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7440, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 3:51 AM because it's the only place cold enough to make me stop shaking. Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth has bones.

I didn't wake you. I let us ride to the end of the line because your head on my shoulder was the first time I understood what people mean by \"home.\"\n\nI wasn't looking for you. That's important. I had perfected the architecture of loneliness\u2014coffee for one, books as lovers, silence as companion. I was fluent in the language of myself.

It was \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" You said, \"No, sadder.\" We looked for an hour. We never found it. I'm still looking.\n\nListen. I need you to understand the violence of what you've done to me. Before you, I could walk through a day without noticing. Now I see everything in relation to you. The man on the corner selling flowers\u2014those are the lilies you're allergic to. The kid crying in the park\u2014that's how you cried when your grandmother's letters were lost in the flood. The silence at 4 AM\u2014that's the silence after you told me about the baby we almost had, the one that lasted seven weeks, the one you named secretly, the one you still talk to sometimes when you think I'm asleep. I'm never asleep. I'm listening to you negotiate with ghosts.\n\nYou want poetry? I'll give you the anti-poetry of us: You clip your toenails in bed and I find them weeks later like archaeological evidence. You've been using the same tea bag for three days because \"it still has flavor.\" Your favorite word is \"petrichor\" but you can never remember what it means, so you use it wrong constantly, beautifully wrong. You have seventeen passwords and they're all variations of your dead cat's name. You steal socks from me then deny it while wearing them. This is what love actually looks like\u2014not the grand gesture but the daily accumulation of specificities that become a religion.\n\nMy mother has dementia. I haven't told you this, but she's forgetting me in pieces. Last week she called me by my dead brother's name. The brother you don't know I had. The one who drowned when I was nine, whose absence shaped me like water shapes stone. But here's what terrifies me: even when she's lost in the labyrinth of her own mind, she remembers you. \"The girl with the loud laugh,\" she calls you. \"The one who makes him stop frowning.\" My mother, who can't remember my name, remembers that you unfrown me. That's what you are\u2014you're the one who unfrowns me.\n\nI keep a list. Not of your flaws\u2014those I've memorized like prayer. But of the moments when I knew this was irreversible:\n- When you eat ice cream, you bite it. Who bites ice cream? You do. With your whole heart.\n- You read the last page of books first because you \"need to know if it's worth the worry.\"\n- You water plastic plants \"just in case they're lonely.\"\n- You've kept every movie ticket from every film we've seen together in a shoebox labeled \"Time Machine.\"\n- When you're nervous, you hum Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, but you don't know that's what it is. You think you made it up.\n\nThat Thursday when your father said you'd never amount to anything, you didn't cry until later, in the shower, where you thought the water would hide it. But I know the difference between water and tears. Tears have weight. Yours fell like stones. That's when I understood: loving you isn't just about celebrating your light. It's about witnessing your darkness and saying, \"Yes, this too. Especially this.\"\n\nHere's what I'm not promising: perfection, resolution, healing. Here's what I am promising: presence. I will be present for your Tuesdays and your Christmases, your promotions and your failures, your graceful moments and the times you walk into glass doors because you're reading while walking. I promise to be the person who knows that you're afraid of butterflies but pretend to love them, who knows you practice arguments in the shower, who knows you still set a place at the table for your grandmother on her birthday.\n\nThe ring isn't what you think. It's not my grandmother's or my mother's. I had it made from the metal of the watch you threw at the wall the night we almost ended, the night you said I loved my sadness more than I loved you. You were right. But that was before I understood that you weren't asking me to stop being sad. You were asking me to be sad WITH you instead of DESPITE you. The ring is literally made from the moment we almost broke. Because that's what marriage is\u2014taking the sharpest edges of ourselves and reshaping them into something that says \"I choose this difficulty. I choose this specific catastrophe. I choose you.\"\n\nSo here it is, without ornament: Marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014you don't. You complicate me. You make me question everything I thought I knew about gravity and time and the proper way to eat spaghetti (you twirl clockwise, I twirl counter-clockwise, we're fundamentally incompatible and I don't care). Marry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't know what you're having for breakfast, where I can't hear you argue with NPR in the morning, where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life. It's just time passing.\n\nI love you. I love you in the stupidest ways. I love you like a dog loves a doorbell, like plants love light, like the ocean loves the moon\u2014automatically, involuntarily, without thought or choice. I love you past the point of poetry into the realm of biological fact.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Say you need time. But know this: you've already altered me at the molecular level. My DNA spells your name now. I'm yours in all the ways that matter and several that don't. This is just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sad fish book you were looking for? It doesn't exist. You made it up. You create things that should exist and then look for them. That's what you did with me\u2014you invented the person I could be and then waited for me to catch up. I'm trying, Leyi. I'm trying to become the person you already see. Marry me and I promise to keep trying, every day, to earn the love you've already given me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop trembling. It's 4:33 AM. The specific time matters because at 4:33 AM, the world hasn't started lying yet.\n\nI need to tell you about the violence of loving you. Not metaphorical violence\u2014the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called\u2014the first time in three years\u2014and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring\u2014I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you\u2014your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist\u2014theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air\u2014not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:01 AM now. The world is starting to lie again. But this won't change: You are the truest thing that has ever happened to me. You are what makes the dying worth it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I can see the program has plateaued around 0.73-0.74 fitness score.
