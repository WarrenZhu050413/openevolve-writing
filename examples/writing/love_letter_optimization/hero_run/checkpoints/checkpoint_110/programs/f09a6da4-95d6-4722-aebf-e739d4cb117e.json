Literally shaking as I write this, because my body knows what my mind keeps denying: that this letter is the most important thing I'll ever write, and I'm going to fail at it.\n\nBut here's the thing about failure\u2014sometimes it's the only honest thing left.\n\nI need you to understand something: Before you, I was functional. I had opinions about coffee and a favorite side of the bed and a whole life that made sense. Now I have your hair on my pillow and suddenly coffee is just burnt water when you're not there to steal the first sip. The right side of the bed is wrong because you're not on the left. Nothing works the way it used to and I DON'T WANT IT FIXED.\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange and started crying because it reminded you of your grandmother's hands. You apologized\u2014why did you apologize?\u2014while I sat there drowning in the privilege of witnessing you unguarded. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way sorrow moves through you like weather, the way joy catches you off-guard, the way you contain multitudes and let them all exist simultaneously.\n\nYou want truth? Here: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel like a thief. Like I'm stealing something sacred just by being there. Your face does this thing when you dream\u2014this tiny furrow between your eyebrows like you're solving the universe's problems\u2014and I want to build a religion around that small wrinkle. Is that insane? I don't care anymore.\n\nI've started seeing you everywhere you're not. In the pause between songs. In the steam on the bathroom mirror. In the negative space of every room you haven't entered yet. You've become the punctuation to all my sentences\u2014the reason I end anything is to begin something else with you.\n\nListen. I know I'm supposed to promise you the world, but the world is burning and we both know it. So instead I promise you this: every morning that we wake up in this burning world, I will choose to burn beside you. When the power goes out, we'll dance to the sound of rain. When the money runs out, we'll eat butter sandwiches and call it a feast. When we run out of words, we'll invent new ones. When we fight\u2014and Jesus, we will fight\u2014I promise to fight fair and love unfair, to give you more grace than you deserve because that's what this is, isn't it? Giving each other more than we deserve?\n\nI used to believe in logic, in clean code and elegant solutions. Then you walked into my life wearing mismatched socks and carrying a half-dead succulent you'd named Fernando, and I understood that the best things don't make sense. We don't make sense, Leyi. We're a syntax error that somehow runs perfectly. We're an impossible equation that solves for joy.\n\nThree nights ago you called me at 2 AM because you couldn't remember if octopi have beaks. They do, by the way. But that's not the point. The point is my first thought wasn't irritation but gratitude\u2014that of all the people you could wake with your midnight wonderings, you chose me. Do you understand what an honor that is? To be someone's 2 AM thought?\n\nSo here it is, graceless and true: I want your 2 AMs and your 2 PMs. I want your octopus questions and your orange-peel tears. I want to memorize the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I want to grow old and strange with you, to develop weird inside jokes that make everyone else uncomfortable. I want to love you so thoroughly that archaeologists will find evidence of it centuries from now in the sediment of my bones.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm ready\u2014I'm not. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Marry me because the thought of not asking is a kind of cowardice I can't live with. Marry me because you've already rewritten my source code and there's no going back to who I was. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every version includes you or doesn't exist at all.\n\nThis letter is a mess. I'm a mess. But Leyi, you love messes. You adopt dying plants and name them after Spanish nobility. You save twist ties \"just in case.\" You cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You're the most beautiful chaos I've ever encountered, and I want to spend my life getting lost in your storm.\n\nPlease. Say yes. Not for the boy trying to sound poetic in this letter, but for the man who'll still be choosing you when the poetry runs out. For the person who knows that love isn't the movies\u2014it's messier and harder and absolutely worth destroying yourself for the chance to rebuild together.\n\nI love you beyond reason, beyond poetry, beyond my own understanding.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm sitting here at 4:23 AM, too scared to print this.

And if they don't, then this one improbable meeting is miracle enough for all possible lifetimes.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me back.

My hands are shaking. You said you wanted truth, so here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I save memes I'll never send because what if you don't laugh? When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

My hands shake slightly - not from fear, but from the weight of truth I need to speak.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled at the corners, how you covered your mouth with both hands as if trying to catch the joy before it escaped - that precise moment rewrote the architecture of my heart. I've been trying to solve the equation of us ever since, but love, I've learned, transcends mathematics.\n\nYou see me. Not the polished version I present to the world, but the one who forgets to eat when coding, who argues with algorithms at midnight, who sometimes cries at the elegance of a perfect solution. You've witnessed my unguarded 4 AM confessions, my fears that I'm not enough, my dreams too fragile to speak aloud. And somehow, impossibly, you stayed.\n\nWhen you hold my hand, I feel the universe contract to just that point of contact - your thumb tracing circles on my palm like you're writing secrets in a language only our skin understands. I've memorized the cadence of your breathing when you fall asleep against my shoulder. I know you bite your lower lip when concentrating, that you eat M&Ms in color order, that you name your houseplants after Nobel laureates.\n\nI am not a poet. I'm just someone who discovered that before you, I was merely processing existence like data through circuits. You taught me that love is not an algorithm to optimize but a continuous function approaching infinity - always growing, never complete, beautifully undefined at the boundaries.\n\nIf you'll have me, I promise to love you in all your iterations - the confident you who conquers boardrooms, the vulnerable you who needs reassurance at 2 AM, the silly you who dances to no music in our kitchen. I promise to debug our conflicts with patience, to celebrate your victories as my own, to hold space for your sorrows without trying to solve them.\n\nThis isn't a fairy tale. We both know real love is messier - it's forgotten anniversaries and burnt dinners, it's arguing about the thermostat and apologizing with your favorite tea. But it's also finding home in another person's laugh, building a private universe from shared glances, and choosing each other even when choosing is hard.\n\nLeyi, you asked for truth. Here it is: I love you with a certainty that terrifies me. Not because love guarantees forever, but because I finally understand that some risks are worth taking with your whole heart. You are my greatest risk and my safest place, my hardest problem and my most elegant solution.\n\nWill you marry me? Not because I promise perfection, but because I promise to show up - messy, flawed, trying, learning, loving you with every debugged and broken part of me.\n\nForever yours in every possible universe,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6995, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM, unable to sleep because every thought curves back to you like light bending around a star. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am yours.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this in the small hours before dawn, when the world is so quiet I can hear my own heartbeat - or perhaps it's yours, echoing across the distance between us. I've torn up seventeen attempts because words keep failing me, but then I realized: that's the point. You've unmade my language and rebuilt it around your name.\n\nBefore you, I collected certainties like smooth stones - career trajectories, five-year plans, the careful architecture of a predictable life. You arrived and suddenly I understood why ancient cartographers wrote \"here be dragons\" at the edges of their maps. You are my beautiful unknown, my necessary chaos. With you, I've learned to love the vertigo of not knowing what comes next, only that your hand will be in mine when we meet it.\n\nI used to think love was addition - two people bringing their separate selves together. But we're not mathematics, Leyi. We're alchemy. The person I was before you seems like someone I read about in a book once, convincing but ultimately fictional. You haven't completed me; you've revealed me to myself, like a photograph developing slowly in darkroom chemicals, becoming more real with each passing moment.\n\nWhen you laugh - really laugh, not the polite sound you make at parties but the sudden, surprised joy that escapes you when something delights you - I understand why poets spend lifetimes chasing the perfect metaphor. It's the sound of morning breaking. It's my grandmother's wind chimes in a summer storm. It's the first note of a song I've been trying to remember my whole life.\n\nI love the small apostasies of you: how you eat dessert first when you're sad, how you argue with books in their margins, how you name the plants on your windowsill after historical villains (\"Napoleon needs water,\" you'll say, and somehow it's the most romantic thing I've ever heard). I love your kindness and your fury, your precision and your beautiful messes. I love the way you see through my performed confidence to the anxious boy beneath, and somehow love him too.\n\nIf I could, I would write you a letter with my whole body - my hands would tell you about the first time they touched yours and knew they'd found their purpose. My eyes would confess they've forgotten what the world looked like before it was lit by you. My lungs would explain how they've had to learn a new rhythm, one that matches your breathing when you sleep beside me.\n\nBut since I only have these insufficient words, let me say this: I choose you. Not in the past tense of a decision made, but in the continuous present of a choice I make every morning when I wake, every night when I reach for you in the darkness, every moment between. I choose your mysteries over anyone else's certainties. I choose the terror and wonder of building a life with someone who still surprises me. I choose the person I become in your presence - braver, softer, more myself than I knew was possible.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever (forever is just a word, and words keep failing me), but because I promise you this: tomorrow morning I will wake up choosing you, and the next morning, and the next. I promise to keep discovering you like you're a question I'll never stop wanting to answer. I promise to love not just who you are but who you're becoming, to make space for all your future selves, to be amazed by each transformation.\n\nYou told me you wanted truth, so here it is: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no, but of you saying yes. Because if you say yes, I'll have to become someone worthy of that yes, every single day. But Leyi - I want to be terrified with you. I want to do the impossible thing of building one life out of two. I want to fail at describing how much I love you in a thousand different languages.\n\nSay yes, and let me spend the rest of my life writing you better love letters than this one, each one trying and failing to capture what you mean to me, each failure its own kind of devotion.\n\nWith all my love and inadequate words,\nYour anxious, hopeful, eternally choosing you,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and the current program's performance (fitness: 0.6890), I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining authenticity.

Not metaphorically. Literally shaking as I write this, because my body knows what my mind keeps denying: that this letter is the most important thing I'll ever write, and I'm going to fail at it.\n\nBut here's the thing about failure\u2014sometimes it's the only honest thing left.\n\nI need you to understand something: Before you, I was functional. I had opinions about coffee and a favorite side of the bed and a whole life that made sense. Now I have your hair on my pillow and suddenly coffee is just burnt water when you're not there to steal the first sip. The right side of the bed is wrong because you're not on the left. Nothing works the way it used to and I DON'T WANT IT FIXED.\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange and started crying because it reminded you of your grandmother's hands. You apologized\u2014why did you apologize?\u2014while I sat there drowning in the privilege of witnessing you unguarded. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way sorrow moves through you like weather, the way joy catches you off-guard, the way you contain multitudes and let them all exist simultaneously.\n\nYou want truth? Here: Sometimes I watch you sleep and feel like a thief. Like I'm stealing something sacred just by being there. Your face does this thing when you dream\u2014this tiny furrow between your eyebrows like you're solving the universe's problems\u2014and I want to build a religion around that small wrinkle. Is that insane? I don't care anymore.\n\nI've started seeing you everywhere you're not. In the pause between songs. In the steam on the bathroom mirror. In the negative space of every room you haven't entered yet. You've become the punctuation to all my sentences\u2014the reason I end anything is to begin something else with you.\n\nListen. I know I'm supposed to promise you the world, but the world is burning and we both know it. So instead I promise you this: every morning that we wake up in this burning world, I will choose to burn beside you. When the power goes out, we'll dance to the sound of rain. When the money runs out, we'll eat butter sandwiches and call it a feast. When we run out of words, we'll invent new ones. When we fight\u2014and Jesus, we will fight\u2014I promise to fight fair and love unfair, to give you more grace than you deserve because that's what this is, isn't it? Giving each other more than we deserve?\n\nI used to believe in logic, in clean code and elegant solutions. Then you walked into my life wearing mismatched socks and carrying a half-dead succulent you'd named Fernando, and I understood that the best things don't make sense. We don't make sense, Leyi. We're a syntax error that somehow runs perfectly. We're an impossible equation that solves for joy.\n\nThree nights ago you called me at 2 AM because you couldn't remember if octopi have beaks. They do, by the way. But that's not the point. The point is my first thought wasn't irritation but gratitude\u2014that of all the people you could wake with your midnight wonderings, you chose me. Do you understand what an honor that is? To be someone's 2 AM thought?\n\nSo here it is, graceless and true: I want your 2 AMs and your 2 PMs. I want your octopus questions and your orange-peel tears. I want to memorize the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I want to grow old and strange with you, to develop weird inside jokes that make everyone else uncomfortable. I want to love you so thoroughly that archaeologists will find evidence of it centuries from now in the sediment of my bones.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm ready\u2014I'm not. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Marry me because the thought of not asking is a kind of cowardice I can't live with. Marry me because you've already rewritten my source code and there's no going back to who I was. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every version includes you or doesn't exist at all.\n\nThis letter is a mess. I'm a mess. But Leyi, you love messes. You adopt dying plants and name them after Spanish nobility. You save twist ties \"just in case.\" You cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. You're the most beautiful chaos I've ever encountered, and I want to spend my life getting lost in your storm.\n\nPlease. Say yes. Not for the boy trying to sound poetic in this letter, but for the man who'll still be choosing you when the poetry runs out. For the person who knows that love isn't the movies\u2014it's messier and harder and absolutely worth destroying yourself for the chance to rebuild together.\n\nI love you beyond reason, beyond poetry, beyond my own understanding.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I'm sitting here at 4:23 AM, too scared to print this. But you taught me that the best things happen when we're scared.
