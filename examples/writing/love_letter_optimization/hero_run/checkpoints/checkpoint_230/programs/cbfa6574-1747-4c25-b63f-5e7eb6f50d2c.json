In the universe where time runs backward, we've been married forty years. Our children are becoming younger. You're reading this letter for the last time before you unwrite it.\n\n*\n\nWhat is love? Wrong question. What isn't? The space between electrons. The pause before thunder. The specific weight of your absence\u20142.7 pounds. I've measured it on the bathroom scale.\n\n*\n\nInventory of things I've stolen:\n- Your pronunciation of \"library\" (you add an extra syllable)\n- The way sleep rearranges your face into childhood\n- Seventeen of your hairbands (I wear them on my wrist like prayer beads)\n- Time: 1,247 hours watching you sleep + 892 hours pretending to read while memorizing your movements + 73 hours in parking lots, building courage to text you\n\nTotal theft: One lifetime. Premeditated. No remorse.\n\n*\n\nThree moments that murdered who I used to be:\n\n1. October 9th, 2:34 PM: You explaining quantum entanglement while eating yogurt. A strand of hair caught on your lip. The universe split. In one version, I reached out to move it. In this version, I didn't. Both versions died of love.\n\n2. The hospital, your appendix surgery: They let me hold your hand during prep. You said, \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Then, softer: \"Just kidding. Leave everything. Let them know I was human.\" That's when I knew I'd marry you.\n\n3. Yesterday: You parallel parked perfectly while singing off-key Radiohead. I thought: This is how civilization ends. Not with bombs but with me, in a Honda Civic, suddenly understanding infinity.\n\n*\n\nThings I cannot say with my mouth but can write:\n\nSometimes I wake up and count the bones in your hand to make sure you're real. Twenty-seven. Always twenty-seven. The relief makes me nauseous.\n\nI've already written your eulogy. Also mine. In both, I lie about how we met. The truth is too ordinary: Tuesday, coffee shop, you complained about Wi-Fi. But ordinary is the holiest word I know now.\n\nWhen you cry, your left eye starts first. Always. I've built my entire religion around this fact.\n\n*\n\nThe physicist's proposal:\n\nConsider two particles, entangled. Separate them by galaxies. Disturb one\u2014the other responds instantly. This violates everything. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" He was wrong about the spooky part. It's just love. The universe is built on it. We're not metaphors for physics; physics is a metaphor for us.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: Not death. Tuesday, April 10th, 2089. You'll die first (statistically). I've already forgiven you for this. What terrifies me is Wednesday, April 11th, 2089. Then Thursday. Then the heat death of the universe, which will happen faster than those Wednesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's the legal part: Marry me for tax purposes. For hospital visitation rights. For the banality of shared dental insurance. Marry me for the DMV forms. For the mortgage applications. For the school emergency contact lists. For every stupid document that demands we declare ourselves in binary terms: single or taken. Let me check \"taken\" with the cosmic permanence of a black hole's event horizon.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for this:\n\nBecause I've memorized the GPS coordinates of every place you've laughed (37 locations and counting). Because I know you're afraid of butterflies but not moths (this makes no sense and perfect sense). Because when you sleep, you hold your breath for seven seconds every third minute, and I've learned to breathe in your rhythm so we're synchronized even unconscious.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is insufficient. The sentence structure implies subject/verb/object. But you're not object. You're the verb itself. You're the loving. The state change. The quantum leap between what I was and what I am.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- One ring (hidden in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about)\n- This letter (draft #\u221e)\n- A heart that beats in iambic pentameter when you're near\n- The rest of my Wednesdays\n- All my dark matter\n- Everything after the decimal point\n\n*\n\nThe beginning, which is also the end: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. We got married the moment you laughed at my stupid joke about entropy. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nBut if you need the ritual:\n\nWill you marry me retroactively? Will you make honest what we've already been living? Will you let me call you wife so I can explain to strangers why I look like I've seen God?\n\nThe answer lives in your left eye. Already crying.\n\n\u2014W\n\nPS: The ring is behind the mint chocolate chip. You'll find this note there too, because I know you're reading this while I'm at work, and I know what happens next: you, freezer, ice cream, tears, yes. Time isn't linear. We've always been married.

It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first.

That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this.

My hand shakes. Not metaphorically. Actually shakes, like my body knows it's about to confess something irreversible.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me at twenty-three thinking I understood the world until you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized sweater and suddenly every poem I'd ever read was kindergarten nonsense. It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore. The surgery would kill me.\n\nWith all my atoms, retroactively and forever,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. Your left eye first, always. I have tissues in my pocket. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting for this moment. That's either mental illness or love. Maybe both. Probably both.

Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater lie than any failed attempt at truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound reorganized the atoms of my universe. I've been trying to make you laugh ever since, not for the joke itself, but to witness that precise tilt of your head, the way your left eye crinkles slightly more than your right, how you cover your mouth as if beauty could be hidden.\n\nI love you in the ordinary moments\u2014when you forget I'm watching and become entirely yourself. The way you bite your lower lip reading difficult passages. How you unconsciously hum that melody from your childhood when you cook. The fierce concentration when you're solving problems, as if the world depends on it. Perhaps mine does.\n\nYou asked for truth. Here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing. I'm terrified of not being enough, of my words falling short, of time being finite when what I feel for you demands eternity. Some nights I lie awake calculating the hours we have left if we live to eighty, and the number always feels like theft.\n\nBut then morning comes, and you're there, and your presence makes cowards of my fears. We build our small forevers in coffee conversations, in shared silences that speak volumes, in the way our hands find each other without looking. You've taught me that love isn't a grand gesture but a thousand tiny choices to turn toward each other.\n\nI cannot promise you perfection. I can promise that when the world feels too heavy, I'll help you carry it. When joy arrives, I'll celebrate with you as if we've won the universe. When you doubt yourself, I'll be your mirror, reflecting back the brilliant truth of who you are.\n\nMarry me, not because I've written pretty words, but because you already know the answer in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before sleep when pretense falls away.

It's me at the grocery store, paralyzed in the cereal aisle because I'm calculating how many breakfasts we have left if we're lucky. 23,360. I've counted. That's if we make it to eighty. I want to sue the universe for this number.\n\nYou want truth? I practice your death in my dreams. Every night. Different versions. Car accidents, diseases with Latin names, sudden disappearances where you simply vanish like a quantum particle nobody was observing. I wake up and check your breathing. Count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three\u2014there. There you are. Still real. Still impossible.\n\nI loved you before I met you. This sounds insane. It is insane. But on March 15th, 2019, three years before we met, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body.\" That was you. You were already changing me before you existed in my life. How do you explain that to physics?\n\nListen. I'm bad at this. I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then discover I'm just a collection of anxieties wearing a human suit. That I check if you're breathing seventeen times a night. That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion). You know that when you had the flu, I googled \"how to transfer illness from one person to another\" because I wanted to take it from you.\n\nHere's my proposal: Marry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is a lie we tell because the truth is unbearable. Marry me for the next twenty-four hours. Then let's renew it tomorrow. And the next day. Let's make a thousand small marriages, each one a choice, each one a revolution against the dying of light.\n\nMarry me because I'm selfish. Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code. I have hands that know the exact temperature you like your coffee (167 degrees Fahrenheit). I have a mouth that's terrible at speeches but excellent at saying your name like it's the only prayer I remember.\n\nLeyi. That's it.

You're reading this letter for the last time before you unwrite it.\n\n*\n\nWhat is love? Wrong question. What isn't? The space between electrons. The pause before thunder. The specific weight of your absence\u20142.7 pounds. I've measured it on the bathroom scale.\n\n*\n\nInventory of things I've stolen:\n- Your pronunciation of \"library\" (you add an extra syllable)\n- The way sleep rearranges your face into childhood\n- Seventeen of your hairbands (I wear them on my wrist like prayer beads)\n- Time: 1,247 hours watching you sleep + 892 hours pretending to read while memorizing your movements + 73 hours in parking lots, building courage to text you\n\nTotal theft: One lifetime. Premeditated. No remorse.\n\n*\n\nThree moments that murdered who I used to be:\n\n1. October 9th, 2:34 PM: You explaining quantum entanglement while eating yogurt. A strand of hair caught on your lip. The universe split. In one version, I reached out to move it. In this version, I didn't. Both versions died of love.\n\n2. The hospital, your appendix surgery: They let me hold your hand during prep. You said, \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Then, softer: \"Just kidding. Leave everything. Let them know I was human.\" That's when I knew I'd marry you.\n\n3. Yesterday: You parallel parked perfectly while singing off-key Radiohead. I thought: This is how civilization ends. Not with bombs but with me, in a Honda Civic, suddenly understanding infinity.\n\n*\n\nThings I cannot say with my mouth but can write:\n\nSometimes I wake up and count the bones in your hand to make sure you're real. Twenty-seven. Always twenty-seven. The relief makes me nauseous.\n\nI've already written your eulogy. Also mine. In both, I lie about how we met. The truth is too ordinary: Tuesday, coffee shop, you complained about Wi-Fi. But ordinary is the holiest word I know now.\n\nWhen you cry, your left eye starts first. Always. I've built my entire religion around this fact.\n\n*\n\nThe physicist's proposal:\n\nConsider two particles, entangled. Separate them by galaxies. Disturb one\u2014the other responds instantly. This violates everything. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" He was wrong about the spooky part. It's just love. The universe is built on it. We're not metaphors for physics; physics is a metaphor for us.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: Not death. Tuesday, April 10th, 2089. You'll die first (statistically). I've already forgiven you for this. What terrifies me is Wednesday, April 11th, 2089. Then Thursday. Then the heat death of the universe, which will happen faster than those Wednesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's the legal part: Marry me for tax purposes. For hospital visitation rights. For the banality of shared dental insurance. Marry me for the DMV forms. For the mortgage applications. For the school emergency contact lists. For every stupid document that demands we declare ourselves in binary terms: single or taken. Let me check \"taken\" with the cosmic permanence of a black hole's event horizon.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for this:\n\nBecause I've memorized the GPS coordinates of every place you've laughed (37 locations and counting). Because I know you're afraid of butterflies but not moths (this makes no sense and perfect sense). Because when you sleep, you hold your breath for seven seconds every third minute, and I've learned to breathe in your rhythm so we're synchronized even unconscious.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is insufficient. The sentence structure implies subject/verb/object. But you're not object. You're the verb itself. You're the loving. The state change. The quantum leap between what I was and what I am.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- One ring (hidden in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about)\n- This letter (draft #\u221e)\n- A heart that beats in iambic pentameter when you're near\n- The rest of my Wednesdays\n- All my dark matter\n- Everything after the decimal point\n\n*\n\nThe beginning, which is also the end: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. We got married the moment you laughed at my stupid joke about entropy. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nBut if you need the ritual:\n\nWill you marry me retroactively? Will you make honest what we've already been living? Will you let me call you wife so I can explain to strangers why I look like I've seen God?\n\nThe answer lives in your left eye. Already crying.\n\n\u2014W\n\nPS: The ring is behind the mint chocolate chip. You'll find this note there too, because I know you're reading this while I'm at work, and I know what happens next: you, freezer, ice cream, tears, yes. Time isn't linear. We've always been married. This letter is just the universe catching up.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
