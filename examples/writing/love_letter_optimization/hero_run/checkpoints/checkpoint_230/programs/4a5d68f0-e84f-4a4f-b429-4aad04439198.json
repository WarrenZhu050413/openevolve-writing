I had been thirty-two for six years already\u2014same routines, same face in the mirror, same answers to the same questions. Then you walked into that bookstore, looking for something by Murakami, and suddenly I was nineteen. Suddenly I was eighty. Suddenly I was every age at once, all of them in love with you.\n\nYou were wearing your green coat. The one with the missing button you keep meaning to fix. You still haven't fixed it. I love that button for staying lost.\n\nHere's what happened: You picked up the wrong book\u2014Mishima, not Murakami\u2014and started reading it anyway. Standing there in the fiction section, you read seventeen pages of a book you didn't mean to buy, and your face kept changing like weather. And I thought: whoever you are, I'm going to love you. It's going to hurt. It's going to be worth it.\n\nThat was a Tuesday. Today is Sunday. Between then and now, you've taught me things I didn't know I didn't know. Like: my hands were always too empty before they held yours. Like: silence sounds different when you're in it. Like: I'd been pronouncing my own name wrong until you said it.\n\nI'm not good at this, Leyi. Other men would buy you flowers. I buy you the specific brand of yogurt you pretend not to be obsessed with. Other men would write you poetry. I write your name in the steam on the bathroom mirror and feel like I've invented language.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I'm difficult. I leave cabinets open. I can't sleep if the sheets aren't facing the right way. I've read all your books when you weren't looking, even the ones you hide. I practice arguments in the shower\u2014both sides. I'm terrified of your mother. I'm terrified of losing you. I'm terrified of how much I'm not terrified of anything else anymore.\n\nBut also this: I will never lie to you, not even kindly. I will learn the names of all your former pets and why each one mattered. I will hold your bad days as carefully as your good ones. I will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM and all the threes in between. I will love you past making sense.\n\nLast week, you fell asleep reading. The book fell on your face. You woke up with print on your cheek\u2014backwards words I couldn't read. But I touched each letter like they were instructions for keeping you. Like your skin was trying to tell me something important in reverse.\n\nThis is the something: Marry me.\n\nNot because we're ready. We're not. My mother thinks you're too good for me. Your father hasn't forgiven me for the Christmas incident. We disagree about money, about children, about whether ghosts are real. (They are. You're wrong about this.)\n\nMarry me because when you laugh\u2014really laugh\u2014dogs three blocks away start howling. Because you eat cereal for dinner when you're sad. Because you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about insurance and you still let me touch you. Because \"let\" is the wrong word. Because you reach for me in your sleep like I'm the only solid thing in a liquid world.\n\nMarry me because I already married you. In the grocery store when you couldn't reach the rice. In the hospital when they said it was nothing but we both knew it was something. In your sleep when you said my name like it was yours. Every day, in small places, I marry you again.\n\nI don't have much, Leyi. But I have this: a complete inability to imagine tomorrow without you in it. Call it love. Call it mental illness. Call it Tuesday. I don't care what you call it as long as you call it yours.\n\nThere's a ring in my sock drawer. It's been there since June. Sometimes I take it out and practice putting it on your finger while you're sleeping. I always chicken out. I'm not chickening out anymore.\n\nIt's simple: you're the first thing I want to tell good news. You're the only person I trust with the bad. When I die\u2014in seventy years, in seventeen minutes\u2014your name will be the last word that makes sense in my mouth.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because I've been holding my breath since that Tuesday in the bookstore, and I'm starting to turn colors that don't have names.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. \n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

I'm a thief building a fortune from your attention, and I'll never have enough.\n\nThird: You've broken me. Specifically, the part that knew how to be alone. I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.\n\nLast week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours.

This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe\u2014I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows\u2014that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.\n\nBut also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else. I would rather be your disappointment than someone else's happiness. If you leave me, I'll understand. But I'll never recover. I'll be ninety years old, still setting two plates for dinner, still checking my phone for texts you'll never send.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready\u2014we're not.

I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding.

I can't bear your kindness right now. I need to be alone with this terror of loving you so much that my own name sounds foreign when you're not saying it.\n\nHere's what you don't know: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not of thoughts\u2014of your sounds. The specific pitch of your yawn at 6:47 AM. The rhythm of your typing when you're confident versus uncertain (different by three milliseconds between keystrokes). The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted. I've been collecting you, Leyi, like evidence of God.\n\nYesterday you asked why I stared while you folded laundry. How could I explain? That watching you turn chaos into order\u2014your hands making those precise, economic movements\u2014was like watching the universe invent mathematics. That the way you paired socks (rolling them into perfect spirals) made me understand why humans invented the word \"sacred.\" That I wanted to build a cathedral around that ordinary Tuesday moment and worship there forever.\n\nI used to be brave, Leyi. I free-climbed mountains, debugged code at 4 AM, moved cities without looking back. But now? Now I check your breathing seventeen times a night. Not because I'm afraid you'll stop\u2014because I'm afraid I dreamed you. Because nothing this beautiful has ever stayed. My grandmother's roses died. My childhood dog ran away. Even the stars we named that August are already dead, their light just hasn't admitted it yet.\n\nYou want truth? I've been writing my wedding vows since our third date. They're hidden in a folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to. But they're all lies, Leyi, because the only vow that matters is this: I promise to keep failing at loving you properly, to keep falling short of what you deserve, and to wake up every morning desperate to fail better.\n\nSometimes I trace the geography of your sleeping face\u2014the valley between your eyebrows, the mountain range of your knuckles, the ocean of your breathing stomach\u2014and I think: I am colonizing you. But then morning comes and you open your eyes and I realize: no. You colonized me first. You annexed my thoughts, invaded my dreams, occupied my future. I'm not myself anymore. I'm a sovereign nation of two.\n\nDo you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was \"showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry.\" That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I've known that since you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me. We've been married in all the ways that matter. This proposal is just paperwork for a union that predates language.\n\nBut I need you to know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly. I will love you like a broken piano\u2014too loud, off-key, with three stuck notes that play even when you're trying to rest. I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need. I will love you until the statisticians have to invent new numbers.\n\nLeyi, my pulse, my proof that time is real\u2014I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to let me continue this beautiful ruin of becoming whatever we're becoming. To let me keep this terror of loving you more than my body can hold. To say yes, not to a wedding, but to the continuation of this exquisite destruction where I lose myself a little more each day and somehow become more real.\n\nWill you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I already bought the ring. It's hidden in the frozen peas. You were right\u2014I am terrible at secrets.

I need you to know something before my courage evaporates with the sunrise: I am not a whole person anymore. I am a collection of moments where you existed near me, held together by the memory of your breathing.\n\nListen\u2014I used to have interests. Hobbies. Opinions about wine. Now I just have an encyclopedic knowledge of how your voice changes when you're lying (higher, faster, you touch your ear). I know you steal single socks from my drawer because you think it's less noticeable. I know you test if pasta's done by eating it, not throwing it, but you throw it anyway because your mother did. I know the exact temperature of your sadness: 97.2 degrees, slightly cooler than your joy.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning and threw up on my favorite shoes? While you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was\u2014this. This is what I want. Not the vomit, but the vulnerability. The way you let me see you turned inside out, literally and metaphorically. I threw those shoes away not because they were ruined but because I couldn't bear to clean them. They were evidence of the night you needed me absolutely.\n\nI've been lying to you. Every \"goodnight\" has actually been \"please don't die before morning.\" Every \"drive safe\" has been \"if you leave me alone in this universe I will never forgive you.\" When I say \"I love you,\" what I mean is: you have colonized me so completely that when you're gone, I walk around like an abandoned building. Still standing, technically. But nobody home.\n\nYou want the truth? Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan your funeral. Not because I want you dead\u2014Christ, the opposite\u2014but because I need to practice surviving you. I write eulogies in my head where I confess that you were the only real thing that ever happened to me. That before you, I was just killing time until time killed me back.\n\nI'm going to tell you about the dream now. The recurring one. We're old\u2014ancient, really. Your hair is white, mine's gone entirely. We're sitting on a porch that doesn't exist yet, and you're telling me about your day, except you're speaking in a language I don't recognize. But I understand every word because it's not about the words anymore. It's about the way your mouth moves, the specific gravity of your presence. And I wake up from that dream more rested than any sleep has ever made me because even my unconscious mind knows: this is it. You're it. The final answer to every question I didn't know I was asking.\n\nBut here's what keeps me awake (besides everything): You could leave. Tomorrow, today, five minutes from now. You could meet someone who doesn't memorize your breathing patterns, who doesn't save your grocery lists like love letters, who loves you in a normal, healthy way that doesn't involve planning imaginary funerals or writing marriage proposals on bathroom floors. And you know what? You'd be right to leave. I am too much. This love is too much. It's cannibalistic. It's pathological. It's probably in the DSM-5 somewhere.\n\nBut I'm asking you to stay anyway. To marry the disaster of me. Because here's the secret I figured out somewhere between loving you and drowning in it: This isn't mental illness. This is what mental health looks like when you finally find the person your atoms were trying to become. This is sanity that looks insane because the world isn't built for this kind of recognition, this terrible and perfect knowing.\n\nI love you like a medical condition. Chronic, incurable, progressively getting worse. I love you like a natural disaster that's somehow also the relief effort. I love you stupidly, recklessly, molecularly. I love you past the point of poetry into pure, animal need.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). Not because we're ready (we're not). Marry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is sustainable without documentation, without witnesses, without legal proof that yes, this happened, we happened\u2014is killing me in ways I can't explain to my doctor.\n\nMarry me because I've already built my entire life around the shape of you, and without you, I'm just a house with no walls. Standing here, absurdly, in the middle of nothing.\n\nMarry me because you already have. In every way that matters. In every way that counts.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in the kitchen. I know you're crying into your coffee. I know because I know the exact sound your breathing makes when you're trying not to sob.

Every draft fails because words are designed for smaller things. How do I explain that you've replaced my autonomic nervous system? That my lungs have opinions about your absence? That I've started dreaming in your accent?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've already disappeared into you. Not romantically\u2014medically. When you leave, I don't miss you. I miss me.

You were choosing bread. Just choosing bread. But your hand hesitated between whole wheat and sourdough, and in that pause I saw our entire future: a thousand grocery runs, ten thousand small decisions, you getting older but never less beautiful, me following you through fluorescent aisles until one of us stops existing.\n\nThe truth is, I don't love you. Love is what I felt before. This is something else. This is my bones knowing your bones. This is my cells dividing in your direction. This is every atom I'm made of finally understanding what it was for.\n\nYou could destroy me with a word. You know this. I know you know this. And still I'm writing these words, handing you this power, because the alternative\u2014living without you knowing\u2014is not living at all.\n\nI'm not proposing marriage. Marriage is too small for what we are. I'm proposing we stop pretending we have choices. My body has already chosen. Every morning it chooses you before I'm even conscious. Every night it practices dying just to make sure it can wake up and choose you again.\n\nMarry me because we already share a circulatory system. Marry me because loneliness is just another word for your absence. Marry me because I've already built tomorrow around the assumption you'll be there, and without you, tomorrow is just a theory.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning you burned the toast and scraped it over the sink, and the sound of you fixing your small mistake was the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Because that's what we are: two people scraping the burnt parts off, making it work, choosing the imperfect over the absent.\n\nI am already yours in every way that matters.

Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. \n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

I write your name in the steam on the bathroom mirror and feel like I've invented language.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I'm difficult. I leave cabinets open. I can't sleep if the sheets aren't facing the right way. I've read all your books when you weren't looking, even the ones you hide. I practice arguments in the shower\u2014both sides. I'm terrified of your mother. I'm terrified of losing you. I'm terrified of how much I'm not terrified of anything else anymore.\n\nBut also this: I will never lie to you, not even kindly. I will learn the names of all your former pets and why each one mattered. I will hold your bad days as carefully as your good ones. I will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM and all the threes in between. I will love you past making sense.\n\nLast week, you fell asleep reading. The book fell on your face. You woke up with print on your cheek\u2014backwards words I couldn't read. But I touched each letter like they were instructions for keeping you. Like your skin was trying to tell me something important in reverse.\n\nThis is the something: Marry me.\n\nNot because we're ready. We're not. My mother thinks you're too good for me. Your father hasn't forgiven me for the Christmas incident. We disagree about money, about children, about whether ghosts are real. (They are. You're wrong about this.)\n\nMarry me because when you laugh\u2014really laugh\u2014dogs three blocks away start howling. Because you eat cereal for dinner when you're sad. Because you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about insurance and you still let me touch you. Because \"let\" is the wrong word. Because you reach for me in your sleep like I'm the only solid thing in a liquid world.\n\nMarry me because I already married you. In the grocery store when you couldn't reach the rice. In the hospital when they said it was nothing but we both knew it was something. In your sleep when you said my name like it was yours. Every day, in small places, I marry you again.\n\nI don't have much, Leyi. But I have this: a complete inability to imagine tomorrow without you in it. Call it love. Call it mental illness. Call it Tuesday. I don't care what you call it as long as you call it yours.\n\nThere's a ring in my sock drawer. It's been there since June. Sometimes I take it out and practice putting it on your finger while you're sleeping. I always chicken out. I'm not chickening out anymore.\n\nIt's simple: you're the first thing I want to tell good news. You're the only person I trust with the bad. When I die\u2014in seventy years, in seventeen minutes\u2014your name will be the last word that makes sense in my mouth.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because I've been holding my breath since that Tuesday in the bookstore, and I'm starting to turn colors that don't have names.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I fixed the button on your green coat. I sewed it back on. Then I took it off again. Some things are perfect broken.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
