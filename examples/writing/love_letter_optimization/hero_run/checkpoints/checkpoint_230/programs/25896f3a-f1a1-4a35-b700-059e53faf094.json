It's 4:33 AM. The specific time matters because at 4:33 AM, the world hasn't started lying yet.\n\nI need to tell you about the violence of loving you. Not metaphorical violence\u2014the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called\u2014the first time in three years\u2014and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring\u2014I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you\u2014your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist\u2014theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air\u2014not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:01 AM now. The world is starting to lie again. But this won't change: You are the truest thing that has ever happened to me.

Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed.

I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths.

I love you because you're Leyi. The one who keeps dead flowers. Who assigns personalities to kitchen appliances. Who still calls your dead grandmother's phone to hear her voicemail. These aren't quirks. They're coordinates. They're how I find you in the dark.\n\nListen. Before you, I had sex. With you, I learned about skin. The spot behind your ear that makes you stop talking mid-sentence. Your wrist\u2014just the inside of your wrist\u2014how it smells like bread and rain. Sometimes you fall asleep holding my hand and I stay awake feeling your pulse. Sixty-eight beats per minute. I've timed it. That's the speed of my religion now.\n\nYou're scared you're not enough. Leyi\u2014you apologized to me for crying when your mother forgot your birthday. You apologized. For having feelings about being forgotten. That's when I knew: you've been taught to make yourself small. But then you sing in the shower\u2014off-key, loud, forgetting half the words\u2014and I think: there she is. There's the person before the world taught her to apologize for existing.\n\nMy father is dying. Actually dying. Pancreatic cancer. Three months, maybe four. Yesterday he said, \"At least you found her.\" Not \"I love you.\" Not \"I'm proud.\" Just \"At least you found her.\" He's never met you but he knows. When a cynical man acknowledges miracles, you pay attention.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. It's not. It's about choosing. And I choose you when you're sobbing about the ending of books. I choose you when you're silent for three days and I don't know why. I choose you when you laugh so hard you snort and then get embarrassed about snorting which makes you snort more. I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means\u2014not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me\u2014you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one. The one who can't whistle. Who puts salt on watermelon. Who still sleeps with a stuffed elephant named Chairman Mao. I'll take all of it, all of you, forever or until one of us stops breathing\u2014whichever comes first.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double. When the world feels impossible, I'll make you toast\u2014butter all the way to the edges\u2014and we'll be impossible together.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: You've already changed me at a molecular level. My DNA has rewritten itself around the fact of you. You're not just in my heart\u2014you're in my cells, my synapses, the calcium of my bones. Leaving you would require surgery I wouldn't survive.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Actually. The way lungs love air\u2014desperately, constantly, without thought or choice.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:24 AM now. I've been writing this for an hour and eleven minutes. That's 4,260 seconds of trying to explain something that exists outside of time. This is the longest I've ever gone without checking if you're still breathing. I'm going to submit this now, then come back to bed and watch you sleep until the sun comes up. That's my favorite kind of morning\u2014the kind where you're still here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Performs well on combined_score (0.7320), Performs well on phenomenological_authenticity (0.7600), Performs well on aesthetic_virtuosity (0.7100), Performs well on affective_force (0.7400), Performs well on literary_innovation (0.6800), Performs well on letter_text (Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm dying.\n\nNot medically.

It's 4:47 AM. I've been awake since Tuesday. Time doesn't work right anymore. It pools in moments where you laugh and drains away when you're gone, leaving me gasping in temporal drought.\n\nI need to tell you something terrible: I was happy before you. That's the cruelest part. I had constructed a sufficient life\u2014books, silences, the reliable disappointment of myself. I was a master of small contentments. Then you walked into that caf\u00e9, apologizing to a chair you'd bumped into, and my careful sufficiency detonated. Now I'm radioactive with wanting more.\n\nThe truth isn't beautiful. The truth is that I catalogue your flaws like holy relics. The way you can't whistle. Your vendetta against cucumbers. How you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. That terrifying thing you do where you love people who don't deserve it, like me. I hoard these imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I haven't invented you from the wishbone of my loneliness.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning at my parents' house\u2014you were green, genuinely green, heaving into their heirloom vase\u2014my mother said later, \"She's not very sturdy, is she?\" And I thought: No, she's not. She's breakable and strange and apologizes to furniture and I would burn down the world to keep her safe. That's when I knew this wasn't love anymore. It was something more dangerous. It was recognition. Like finding my own kidney in another person's body.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. Leyi, \"enough\" is a word invented by people who've never watched you try to save dead houseplants with CPR. Who've never seen you leave voice messages for your grandmother who died three years ago because you can't bear to delete her number. You're not enough\u2014you're too much. You're excessive. You're what happens when the universe forgets to be careful.\n\nI've started to understand religion because of you. Not God\u2014that's too simple. But the holy terror of being chosen by something you don't deserve. Every night you choose to sleep beside me feels like a bureaucratic error in heaven that no one's caught yet. I wake up at 3 AM just to watch you breathe, to confirm the miracle is still happening, that they haven't recalled you for being incorrectly distributed to someone like me.\n\nDo you want to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's watching you eat cereal at midnight, milk dripping onto your constellation of a nightshirt, and thinking: I would die without this. Not metaphorically. Literally. My cells would forget their purpose. It's calculating the precise angle you tilt your head when you're about to cry and positioning myself to catch you. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday afternoons when you're just reading and I have to leave the room because the sight of you existing makes my chest cavity feel too small.\n\nThat Thursday when my father called me a disappointment again\u2014thirty-four years old and still his favorite failure\u2014you didn't say I wasn't. You said, \"Good. Disappoint him more. Disappoint everyone who wanted you small.\" Then you made me instant ramen, the cheap kind, and added an egg exactly the way sadness tastes better. How did you know that was the antidote? How do you always know which version of me needs which version of you?\n\nHere's my confession: I've already married you in every way that matters. In the quantum mechanics of my intention. In the cellular democracy where every atom voted yes. In the future that's already happened where we're old and you still can't whistle and I still love the trying. The ceremony, the paper, the ring\u2014that's just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nBut I want the paperwork. I want the evidence. I want to be arrested with proof of you. I want strangers to know that you, inexplicably, chose me. That Leyi Chen, who keeps fortunes from fortune cookies sorted by year, who practices arguments with houseplants, who still leaves one bite of everything \"for the angels\"\u2014that this impossible person looked at me, Warren Zhang, professional disappointment and amateur human, and said: him, I choose him.\n\nSo here it is, the violence of truth: Marry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word for this catastrophe. Marry me because I've already died and been resurrected by you so many times that my death certificate is basically fiction. Marry me because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014is a paradox that makes physics uncomfortable. Marry me because I bought your grandmother's thimble from your aunt and had it made into a ring, and if you don't wear it, I'll have to explain to a thimble why it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're already terminal with each other. This is just asking permission to name the disease.\n\nI am yours in the way that rivers are the ocean's\u2014inevitably, gravitationally, without other options.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's ordinary. You've made me unfit for any life but the one where you can't whistle and I love the trying.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've written and deleted this seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nThe truth: I was complete before you. That's what makes this so frightening. I had built a quiet, functional life. I knew how to be alone. I was good at it. Then you happened, and now I can't remember why I thought that was enough.\n\nYou should know who you're considering marrying. I'm the man who still checks if the door is locked three times. Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters. Because in the face of that absolute certainty, we get to choose what we do with the time between now and then.\n\nI choose you. Not the idea of you, not the future with you, but you\u2014this specific human who saves fortunes from fortune cookies in books, who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, who can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. I choose your mundane Wednesday self, your inconvenient sadnesses, your embarrassing enthusiasms.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for sixty-seven days. Some nights I take it out and practice this moment. But this isn't practice anymore. This is the real attempt, the shaking hands, the imperfect words. This is me, Warren, the anxious man who loves you with a specificity that borders on madness, asking you, Leyi, the woman who changed my understanding of time itself, to marry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you\u2014words are just words. But because you've already moved me. Physically. Molecularly. Into a different person who believes, for the first time, that he deserves to be loved by someone who eats sandwiches from the inside out.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. These are not contradictions.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the atomic structure of my existence. The rest is just paperwork.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I love you.

Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

Last week you spent forty minutes teaching our neighbor's kid how to tie his shoes because his parents were \"too busy.\" You leave water bowls for street cats in summer. You still write thank-you cards by hand. Leyi, ordinary people don't glow from the inside when they talk about photosynthesis. They don't name their sourdough starter \"Kevin\" and apologize when they forget to feed him.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of flying, of commitment, of that space between sleeping and waking where you're not sure what's real. But you\u2014you walk through the world like fear is just another language you decided not to learn. When I'm with you, I forget to be afraid. Or maybe I remember that being afraid is just another way of being alone, and I'm not alone anymore.\n\nThree things I know:\n1. You can't sleep if the dishes aren't done.\n2. You cry at every movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to it?\"\n3. When you love someone, you love them with your whole body\u2014I've seen you love your sister, your students, that plant you rescued from the clearance shelf. It's terrifying and beautiful, like watching someone set themselves on fire to keep others warm.\n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I was whole when I met you. You were whole too. We're not two halves making a whole\u2014we're two wholes making something else. Something that doesn't have a name yet. Something that sounds like your laugh at 1 AM when you remember a joke from three weeks ago.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Wednesday groceries and Sunday crosswords. Bad coffee I'll pretend is good because you made it. Sitting in waiting rooms holding your hand while doctors tell us things we don't want to hear. Dancing in the kitchen to no music. Fighting about whether to get a dog (we both want one but pretend we don't). Growing old and strange and specific together.\n\nThe ring in my pocket belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for 67 years, never took it off. When she was dying, she pulled me close and said: \"Find someone who makes you forget you're going to die.\" I found you. You make me forget everything except this: we're alive, right now, together. What else could possibly matter?\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I still can't fold fitted sheets. I'll forget birthdays. I'll say the wrong thing at the worst moment. But I promise this: every morning I wake up, I'll choose you. When you're impossible. When I'm worse. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you like a reflex, like breathing, like gravity.\n\nYou told me once that you don't believe in soulmates. Good. I don't either. Soulmates are for people who think love is magic. Love isn't magic\u2014it's a decision you make every day. It's choosing to see the same person with new eyes every morning. It's saying \"yes\" to all of it\u2014the mundane Tuesdays, the hard conversations, the way you leave cabinets open like you're airing out the kitchen.\n\nSo this is me, asking you to keep choosing me. To marry me. Not because we're meant to be\u2014nothing is meant to be. But because we decided to be. Because out of all the accidents in the universe, the accident of us is the one I want to keep having.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: you've already changed the shape of my life. I'm different now, in all the permanent ways. I eat slower. I notice birds. I save the fortunes from fortune cookies because you taught me they're tiny poems. I am irreversibly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in forever? I said no. I lied. Forever is your hand finding mine in the dark. It's you saying \"tell me about your day\" and meaning it. It's this. It's us. It's already happening.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm dying.\n\nNot medically. But the person I was before you\u2014he's gone. I watch him sometimes in old photos. He looks like me but his eyes are wrong. They haven't seen you cry at the news. They don't know you eat mangoes in the bathtub. They've never watched you forgive me for things I couldn't forgive myself for.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need you to believe it: I don't love you because you're perfect. I love you because you're Leyi. The one who keeps dead flowers. Who assigns personalities to kitchen appliances. Who still calls your dead grandmother's phone to hear her voicemail. These aren't quirks. They're coordinates. They're how I find you in the dark.\n\nListen. Before you, I had sex. With you, I learned about skin. The spot behind your ear that makes you stop talking mid-sentence. Your wrist\u2014just the inside of your wrist\u2014how it smells like bread and rain. Sometimes you fall asleep holding my hand and I stay awake feeling your pulse. Sixty-eight beats per minute. I've timed it. That's the speed of my religion now.\n\nYou're scared you're not enough. Leyi\u2014you apologized to me for crying when your mother forgot your birthday. You apologized. For having feelings about being forgotten. That's when I knew: you've been taught to make yourself small. But then you sing in the shower\u2014off-key, loud, forgetting half the words\u2014and I think: there she is. There's the person before the world taught her to apologize for existing.\n\nMy father is dying. Actually dying. Pancreatic cancer. Three months, maybe four. Yesterday he said, \"At least you found her.\" Not \"I love you.\" Not \"I'm proud.\" Just \"At least you found her.\" He's never met you but he knows. When a cynical man acknowledges miracles, you pay attention.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. It's not. It's about choosing. And I choose you when you're sobbing about the ending of books. I choose you when you're silent for three days and I don't know why. I choose you when you laugh so hard you snort and then get embarrassed about snorting which makes you snort more. I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you. I want us to be that couple shuffling through the grocery store, still arguing about tomatoes, still holding hands with our arthritic fingers. I want to watch your face change. I want to earn every new line, every gray hair. I want to be there when you need reading glasses and refuse to admit it. I want the whole slow disaster of aging, but with you.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's. She wore it for sixty years while my grandfather slowly lost his mind to Alzheimer's. The last thing he remembered was her name. That's what this ring means\u2014not forever, because forever is a concept. It means even when everything else goes, you're what remains.\n\nLast week you asked if I think we're meant to be. No. Meant implies purpose, design, fate. We're not meant to be. We're what happened when two people chose each other despite the odds. That's harder than fate. That's a decision we make every morning.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you. Not because you love me\u2014you already do, inexplicably. Marry me because I've seen you at 3 AM with food poisoning. I've seen you mean to your mother when she deserved it. I've seen you ugly-cry at commercials for banks. I've seen you fail at parallel parking seventeen times in a row. I've seen all your worst angles and I still think you're the point of everything.\n\nMarry me because life is short and brutal and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone who sees through your performance to the terrified human underneath and says: \"Yeah, I'll take that one.\"\n\nThis is me saying: I'll take that one. The one who can't whistle. Who puts salt on watermelon. Who still sleeps with a stuffed elephant named Chairman Mao. I'll take all of it, all of you, forever or until one of us stops breathing\u2014whichever comes first.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you can't remember who you are, I'll remind you. When you can't love yourself, I'll love you double. When the world feels impossible, I'll make you toast\u2014butter all the way to the edges\u2014and we'll be impossible together.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: You've already changed me at a molecular level. My DNA has rewritten itself around the fact of you. You're not just in my heart\u2014you're in my cells, my synapses, the calcium of my bones. Leaving you would require surgery I wouldn't survive.\n\nI love you. Not poetically. Actually. The way lungs love air\u2014desperately, constantly, without thought or choice.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:24 AM now. I've been writing this for an hour and eleven minutes. That's 4,260 seconds of trying to explain something that exists outside of time. This is the longest I've ever gone without checking if you're still breathing. I'm going to submit this now, then come back to bed and watch you sleep until the sun comes up. That's my favorite kind of morning\u2014the kind where you're still here.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7320 while exploring new territory in the solution space.

It's 4:33 AM. The specific time matters because at 4:33 AM, the world hasn't started lying yet.\n\nI need to tell you about the violence of loving you. Not metaphorical violence\u2014the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called\u2014the first time in three years\u2014and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring\u2014I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you\u2014your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist\u2014theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air\u2014not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:01 AM now. The world is starting to lie again. But this won't change: You are the truest thing that has ever happened to me. You are what makes the dying worth it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
