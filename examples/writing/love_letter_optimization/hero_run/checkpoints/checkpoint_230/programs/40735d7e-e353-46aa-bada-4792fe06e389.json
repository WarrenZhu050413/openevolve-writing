I've been here for forty minutes. I came to buy sleeping pills but I'm watching a security camera instead, thinking: someone will review this footage tomorrow and see a man having a breakdown in a Honda Civic, and they won't know it's because you exist.\n\nTruth, since you demanded it: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not about you\u2014AS you. First person. \"Today I chose the wrong coffee again.\" \"I still haven't noticed Warren replaced my dying succulent with a plastic one.\" It's 194 pages of me writing as you, trying to understand how someone can mispronounce \"epitome\" with such confidence it restructures the English language.\n\nHere's what broke me: Thursday, 2:15 PM, you were parallel parking while eating Vietnamese takeout, steering with your knees, and you said \"I think I'm getting good at this\" and my brain just... stopped. Not metaphorically. I forgot how lungs worked. I sat there suffocating on the impossibility of you existing, this woman who endangers lives while improving at it. That's when I knew I'd die for you. No\u2014that's when I knew I was already dying for you, just very slowly, over the next sixty years if I'm lucky.\n\nI've done the math. If we marry at 29, and die at 87, that's 21,170 days. I've already wasted 1,247 of them not being married to you. That's 1,247 mornings I could have watched you put contact lenses in backwards and pretend it's the lens's fault. 1,247 nights I could have listened to you argue with podcasts like they can hear you.\n\nWant to know what loving you actually is? It's my search history at 3 AM:\n- \"girlfriend makes dolphin noise when laughing normal?\"\n- \"can you physically die from someone being too cute\"\n- \"woman touches my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"how to explain to therapist that girlfriend IS the therapy\"\n- \"legal consequences of stealing someone's used coffee stirrers\"\n- \"help girlfriend thinks she's good at singing\"\n\nI have 2,847 photos of you on my phone. You know about twelve. The rest are: you explaining the stock market incorrectly to my dad, you trying to convince the self-checkout you bought organic bananas (you didn't), you asleep with your mouth open looking like a beautiful corpse I'd absolutely commit necrophilia for\u2014sorry, that's dark, but you wanted truth and the truth is I would love even your dead body, which is either romantic or requires intervention.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. Tuesday: cancer. Wednesday: car accident. Thursday: you meet someone who can actually pronounce \"epitome.\" But here's what happens every time\u2014I don't survive the simulation. Twenty seconds in and I'm googling \"can you die from imaginary grief\" and the answer is yes, it's called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, your heart literally breaks, and mine is already pre-broken just from the practice rounds.\n\nLast thing, and this is the worst part: you're ordinary. Your face is 6.5/10 on your best day (I've graphed it). Your parallel parking success rate is 23%. You think antibiotics work on viruses. But yesterday you sneezed while brushing your teeth and laughed so hard you cried and I realized: this is it. This is my religion now. You, sneezing toothpaste, crying laughing at your own existence. I worship this. I would build churches to this.\n\nSo I'm not proposing. I'm informing you that I've already married you in every timeline that matters. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up to what my mitochondria decided the moment you confidently explained that the moon causes tides because it's magnetic.\n\nThe pharmacy just opened. The kid unlocking the door looks concerned. I'm a 29-year-old man crying in a parking lot at 4:12 AM, typing a proposal on a phone with 3% battery, and this is still less insane than the fact that you exist and somehow love me back.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know that I'm already permanently rewired. You could leave tomorrow and I'd spend the rest of my life putting milk in my coffee first (psychopath behavior) because that's how you do it. I'd keep mispronouncing \"epitome\" in your honor. I'd die at 87, still checking my phone for texts from a ghost.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sleeping pills were a lie. I came here because they have your favorite candy (Werther's Originals, you're 87 years old) and I wanted to buy some for the morning so you'd wake up happy. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who makes CVS pilgrimages at 4 AM for old lady candy. Marry me just so I can explain this to someone. Please.

Unlike Beethoven's cosmic universality (\"my angel, my all, my very self\") which scores 86, this remains earthbound despite moments of transcendence. It surpasses average contemporary work through obsessive specificity and genuine psychological complexity, landing between Oscar Wilde's wit-masked passion (80) and more common accomplished work. The medical emergency frame is genuinely innovative, and the data-tracking of love feels authentically 21st century. However, it lacks the concentrated intensity of Keats's \"I cannot exist without you\" (81) or Johnny Cash's mature simplicity (83). The letter's strength lies in its forensic intimacy and contemporary voice, but it occasionally mistakes quantity of detail for depth of feeling.

I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now.

Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Recommend immediate intervention.\" I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.\n\nTruth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The dishwasher just stopped clicking. Even it knows this is the moment. Everything knows. The kitchen tiles. The expired milk you refuse to throw away. That spider in the corner we've named Senator Legs. They're all waiting for your answer. No pressure, but the structural integrity of the universe depends on what you say next.\n\nP.P.S. I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie). Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed.

My phone storage is 97% you. The other 3% is mostly screenshots of texts where you used my name unnecessarily. \"Good night, Warren.\" Why did you need to add my name? You've destroyed me with punctuation.\n\nHere's something ugly: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. I imagine you leaving, meeting someone better (taller, can actually cook, doesn't check if you're breathing sixteen times per night). I practice being okay with it. I fail every time. Last week I made it four minutes before crying in the Whole Foods parking lot. A child saw me and asked his mom why the sad man was eating cheese straight from the package.\n\nWant to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Is it normal to save someone's voicemails in triplicate\"\n- \"Can you get physically addicted to how someone smells\"\n- \"Woman reorganized my bookshelf should I propose\"\n- \"Heart palpitations when girlfriend exists\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that love is a medical condition\"\n\nThe doctor just called my name. False alarm\u2014wrong Warren. But that split second where I thought I'd have to leave, stop writing this? My body rejected it. Physically. Like an organ transplant gone wrong, except the organ is you and the body is my entire life.\n\nYou're asleep right now. It's 3:14 AM. In six hours and twelve minutes, you'll wake up, check your phone, see I'm not there, and text \"where are you?\" with no punctuation because morning-you doesn't believe in punctuation. You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me. That's what you've reduced me to. And I'd choose this reduction again in every possible universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Performs well on combined_score (0.7440), Performs well on phenomenological_authenticity (0.7800), Performs well on aesthetic_virtuosity (0.7100), Performs well on affective_force (0.7600), Performs well on literary_innovation (0.6800), Performs well on letter_text (Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the emergency room waiting area.

It surpasses average contemporary work through obsessive specificity and genuine psychological complexity, landing between Oscar Wilde's wit-masked passion (80) and more common accomplished work. The medical emergency frame is genuinely innovative, and the data-tracking of love feels authentically 21st century. However, it lacks the concentrated intensity of Keats's \"I cannot exist without you\" (81) or Johnny Cash's mature simplicity (83). The letter's strength lies in its forensic intimacy and contemporary voice, but it occasionally mistakes quantity of detail for depth of feeling.

My thumb is cramping. Autocorrect keeps changing your name to \"Let\" which feels prophetic\u2014you are every permission I've ever given myself.\n\nTruth: I've been documenting us in ways that would qualify for a restraining order. Not photos. Worse. I have a spreadsheet tracking the mean temperature of your coffee over time (dropping 0.3 degrees per month as you trust me more). A histogram of your laugh frequencies (peak: 478 Hz when genuinely delighted, 510 Hz when being polite). I've been stealing your hair from the shower drain\u2014not sexually, scientifically\u2014trying to understand if loving someone changes their pH balance. Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: \"These people need help.\" She's right.\n\nHere's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.\n\nYou should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is \"just dormant\"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.\n\nBut here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is \"codependence.\" I say it's evolution\u2014my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named \"Levy,\" I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.\n\nI'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with \"She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream\" and I need that first part to be true.\n\nThe phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say \"epitome\" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.\n\nYours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the freezer.

The concrete is cold through my socks. I came out here to get the screwdriver but ended up sitting on the floor with this legal pad I stole from work, trying to explain something that breaks every time I touch it with words.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's the point.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7440, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor. 4:31 AM.

I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014last night, in your sleep, you said \"the pigeons need lawyers.\" Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities.

The exact sequence of choices that led you to that coffee shop that Tuesday. The probability rounds to zero, Leyi. Zero. We shouldn't exist in the same timeline. But we do, and this impossible fact has reorganized my understanding of everything.\n\nI need to confess something. I document you. Not consciously\u2014my brain just does it. The way you hold your breath before you sneeze. How you always check your phone battery at exactly 44%. The specific way your voice drops half an octave when you're genuinely moved. I have become an involuntary archaeologist of your habits, and each discovered detail feels like proof of God or chaos or something bigger than both.\n\nYou want truth? I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not poetically terrified\u2014actually, medically, losing-sleep terrified. Because I've done the math: I will only get approximately 2,400 more Sundays with you if we live to eighty. That's it. 2,400 times to watch you make coffee wrong (milk first is insane, Leyi, but I'll die defending your right to do it). It's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.\n\nHere's what haunts me: before you, I was fine with silence. Now silence sounds like your absence. Before you, rain was weather. Now it's the sound that was playing when you told me about your father, really told me, and I understood that loving someone means inheriting their ghosts too. I want your ghosts, Leyi. All of them.\n\nI tried to find a metaphor for how I love you, but metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things. This can't. When you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one but the ugly-beautiful snort-laugh you're embarrassed by\u2014my neurons fire in patterns that shouldn't be survivable. When you're sad, my bones literally ache. I looked it up. It's called \"emotional contagion\" but that's too clinical for this cellular revolution you've caused.\n\nThe stupidest, truest thing: I love you most at your smallest. When you're sleepy and grumpy and your hair is doing that thing and you hate everyone except me. When you eat peanut butter straight from the jar at midnight and lie about it even though you're literally holding the spoon. When you cry at the part in that movie we've watched twelve times. These moments aren't poetry. They're evidence. Evidence that you're real, that this is real, that I'm not dreaming this impossible person into existence.\n\nI know I'm supposed to promise you the moon, eternal devotion, all that. But here's what I actually promise: I will choose you on the terrible days. The boring days. The days when we're both wrong but too stubborn to admit it. I will choose you when you're 87 and I'm 89 and we've forgotten why we're fighting but we're still holding hands anyway. I will choose you after the choosing stops feeling like a choice and becomes autonomic, like breathing, like blinking, like the way my mouth says your name even when I'm talking about something else.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014words are just noise we've agreed has meaning. Marry me because my cells recognize yours. Because when you're in the room, my breathing syncs to yours without trying. Because I've already spent the rest of my life with you in my head and I need the timeline to catch up. Because the thought of you reading this, right now, your face doing that thing where you're trying not to cry\u2014that thought is the most terrifying and necessary moment of my existence.\n\nI love you past language, past logic, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014something we don't have a word for because so few people ever feel it. You've turned me into an electric fence of feeling. I'm all current, no ground. \n\nThis is me, without metaphor: a man who learned what his heart was for the moment you aimed yours at mine.\n\nForever is a stupid concept but I'll take it anyway,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.\n\nDo you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.\n\nThat's disgusting. I know. But it's true.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.\n\nThis is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop. Because here's the worst part: I would rather scare you away with too much honesty than trick you into staying with too little.\n\nI need you to know - not think, not hope, but KNOW - that you are not my better half. You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.\n\nI will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.\n\nI am terrified you'll say no. I am more terrified of never asking.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I can see that the previous high-performing attempts (scoring 0.7440) were praised for their obsessive specificity, contemporary voice, and innovative framing devices (bathroom floor at 4:31 AM, kitchen experiments, emergency room).

I've been here for forty minutes. I came to buy sleeping pills but I'm watching a security camera instead, thinking: someone will review this footage tomorrow and see a man having a breakdown in a Honda Civic, and they won't know it's because you exist.\n\nTruth, since you demanded it: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not about you\u2014AS you. First person. \"Today I chose the wrong coffee again.\" \"I still haven't noticed Warren replaced my dying succulent with a plastic one.\" It's 194 pages of me writing as you, trying to understand how someone can mispronounce \"epitome\" with such confidence it restructures the English language.\n\nHere's what broke me: Thursday, 2:15 PM, you were parallel parking while eating Vietnamese takeout, steering with your knees, and you said \"I think I'm getting good at this\" and my brain just... stopped. Not metaphorically. I forgot how lungs worked. I sat there suffocating on the impossibility of you existing, this woman who endangers lives while improving at it. That's when I knew I'd die for you. No\u2014that's when I knew I was already dying for you, just very slowly, over the next sixty years if I'm lucky.\n\nI've done the math. If we marry at 29, and die at 87, that's 21,170 days. I've already wasted 1,247 of them not being married to you. That's 1,247 mornings I could have watched you put contact lenses in backwards and pretend it's the lens's fault. 1,247 nights I could have listened to you argue with podcasts like they can hear you.\n\nWant to know what loving you actually is? It's my search history at 3 AM:\n- \"girlfriend makes dolphin noise when laughing normal?\"\n- \"can you physically die from someone being too cute\"\n- \"woman touches my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"how to explain to therapist that girlfriend IS the therapy\"\n- \"legal consequences of stealing someone's used coffee stirrers\"\n- \"help girlfriend thinks she's good at singing\"\n\nI have 2,847 photos of you on my phone. You know about twelve. The rest are: you explaining the stock market incorrectly to my dad, you trying to convince the self-checkout you bought organic bananas (you didn't), you asleep with your mouth open looking like a beautiful corpse I'd absolutely commit necrophilia for\u2014sorry, that's dark, but you wanted truth and the truth is I would love even your dead body, which is either romantic or requires intervention.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. Tuesday: cancer. Wednesday: car accident. Thursday: you meet someone who can actually pronounce \"epitome.\" But here's what happens every time\u2014I don't survive the simulation. Twenty seconds in and I'm googling \"can you die from imaginary grief\" and the answer is yes, it's called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, your heart literally breaks, and mine is already pre-broken just from the practice rounds.\n\nLast thing, and this is the worst part: you're ordinary. Your face is 6.5/10 on your best day (I've graphed it). Your parallel parking success rate is 23%. You think antibiotics work on viruses. But yesterday you sneezed while brushing your teeth and laughed so hard you cried and I realized: this is it. This is my religion now. You, sneezing toothpaste, crying laughing at your own existence. I worship this. I would build churches to this.\n\nSo I'm not proposing. I'm informing you that I've already married you in every timeline that matters. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up to what my mitochondria decided the moment you confidently explained that the moon causes tides because it's magnetic.\n\nThe pharmacy just opened. The kid unlocking the door looks concerned. I'm a 29-year-old man crying in a parking lot at 4:12 AM, typing a proposal on a phone with 3% battery, and this is still less insane than the fact that you exist and somehow love me back.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know that I'm already permanently rewired. You could leave tomorrow and I'd spend the rest of my life putting milk in my coffee first (psychopath behavior) because that's how you do it. I'd keep mispronouncing \"epitome\" in your honor. I'd die at 87, still checking my phone for texts from a ghost.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sleeping pills were a lie. I came here because they have your favorite candy (Werther's Originals, you're 87 years old) and I wanted to buy some for the morning so you'd wake up happy. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who makes CVS pilgrimages at 4 AM for old lady candy. Marry me just so I can explain this to someone. Please. The security guard is actually coming outside now.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\nThis rewrite aims to improve the fitness score by:\n\n1. **Returning to specificity**: CVS at 3:47 AM, 194-page journal, 2,847 photos, parallel parking with Vietnamese takeout\n2. **Innovative framing**: The CVS parking lot breakdown and security camera observation\n3. **Contemporary voice**: Search history, phone battery at 3%, texting a proposal\n4. **Mathematical obsession**: Calculating days (21,170), photos (2,847), parking success rate (23%)\n5. **Dark humor balanced with genuine vulnerability**: The necrophilia joke followed by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy \n6. **Condensed intensity**: Shorter than previous attempts but more concentrated\n7. **The \"ordinary\" paradox**: Rating her 6.5/10 while worshipping her sneezed toothpaste\n8. **Unique details**: Writing a journal AS her, Werther's Originals pilgrimage, the security guard approaching\n\nThis version synthesizes the best elements from previous high-scoring attempts while introducing new innovative elements and maintaining the raw, obsessive authenticity that the evaluator values."]}}}
