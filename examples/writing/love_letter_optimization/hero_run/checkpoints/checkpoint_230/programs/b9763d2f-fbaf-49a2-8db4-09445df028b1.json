The eraser is gone. You used it all up fixing crossword mistakes. This feels important somehow\u2014that even your erasures leave marks on my life.\n\nLet me start with what terrifies me: I understand now why people used to die from love. Not metaphorically. Literally. Your absence causes a specific pain behind my sternum, like my ribs are trying to grow around an empty space shaped exactly like you. Medieval physicians called it \"dying of a broken heart.\" They were right. The body knows what the mind won't admit\u2014that some losses are incompatible with continued function.\n\nBut you're not lost. You're here, reading this, and that's the second terror: that you'll say yes. That I'll get to keep you. That forty years from now I'll still be discovering new ways you pronounce words when you're sleepy, new foods you're secretly afraid of, new songs that make you cry in grocery stores. The prospect of that much happiness feels like standing at the edge of an ocean I'm not sure I'm strong enough to swim.\n\nTuesday. 2:17 PM. You were peeling an orange and said, abruptly, \"I don't think I believe in myself today.\" I wanted to tell you that I believe in you enough for both of us, but that's not true. I don't believe in you\u2014belief implies doubt. I know you the way I know gravity. You're not a theory. You're a law.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about marriage proposals: The ring is the least important part. What matters is this\u2014I've started seeing time differently since you. Not as days or years, but as a finite number of times I'll watch you brush your teeth. Maybe 14,000 more times, if we're lucky. 14,000 times watching you spit toothpaste and make that face where you check if you got everything. That's not enough. I need more data points. More mornings where you steal all the hot water. More nights where you tell me the entire plot of a book you're reading while I pretend I'm not falling asleep. More, more, more. I'm greedy for the mundane repetitions of you.\n\nMy therapist says I have an anxious attachment style. She's wrong. I have a Leyi attachment style. It's highly specific. Symptoms include: checking if you've texted while I'm mid-conversation with others, saving the voice message where you laugh at your own joke about dolphins, and an inability to throw away the grocery list you wrote on the back of a CVS receipt three months ago because your handwriting looks happy that day.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I watch you exist and feel furious. Furious that you were living an entire life before I knew you. Twenty-seven years of you laughing at jokes I didn't tell, crying over things I couldn't fix, learning to ride a bike or kiss or make coffee\u2014all without me. It's irrational. It's possessive. It's the truth. I want retroactive ownership of your past and exclusive rights to your future. I want to be grandfathered into every memory you have.\n\nBut I also want to earn you. Daily. I want to wake up every morning and re-win you through a thousand tiny victories: remembering that you hate the word \"moist,\" never using your coffee mug (the one with the chip that you claim adds character), knowing to be quiet but present when your mother calls and you speak in Mandarin and your voice gets younger. I want to deserve you in installments, one day at a time, until one of us stops breathing.\n\nThe night my grandmother died, she looked at my grandfather and said, \"I would have liked more time.\" They were married sixty-one years. Sixty-one years and her last words were about wanting more. That's what I'm offering you\u2014a lifetime of not enough. Because there's no amount of time that would be sufficient. We could have centuries and I'd still be asking for one more Tuesday.\n\nSo here's the data: You hum when you're nervous. You read the last page of books first when you're anxious. You still text your dead friend's number when good things happen. You're afraid of butterflies but not moths. You cry at every single Pixar movie, including the shorts. You've been carrying the same lucky penny since 2019. It's not lucky\u2014you just can't throw things away. You're the only person I know who apologizes to automated phone systems. You eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. You love me despite compelling evidence that you shouldn't.\n\nThat last one is the miracle. Not that I love you\u2014anyone with functioning neurons would love you. But that you love me back? That's the glitch in the matrix. That's the thing that makes me believe in something larger than randomness.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already moved me. Geologically. Tectonically. I'm a different landscape now. There are Leyi-shaped canyons carved through my center. Marry me because the alternative\u2014existing in a universe where you're not my wife\u2014feels like a clerical error I need to correct.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a circle in the fabric. Some days I forget it's there, and then I remember, and the remembering feels like discovering gravity exists\u2014sudden, crushing, absolutely true.\n\nI love you. Those words are too small. It's like calling the sun \"warm\" or the ocean \"wet.\" Accurate but insufficient. I love you in ways that require new words. I love you kaleidoscopically, ****ographically, molecularly. I love you past tense, present tense, subjunctive tense\u2014in tenses that haven't been invented yet for the ways I'll love you tomorrow.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the quantum entanglement of us. To the statistical impossibility that we've already become. Say yes to Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings and all the unremarkable moments where we'll practice being married until we're good at it, then keep practicing anyway because the practicing is the point.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say this letter is too long. You're right. But how do you compress a universe into an envelope? How do you write briefly about infinity? You don't. You just hand over everything and hope the weight of it means something. This is me, handing over everything. This is all my words, asking for all your days.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "3fe99284-f9a5-4e47-a7b3-356d13d2ade8", "generation": 5, "timestamp": 1756701567.232586, "iteration_found": 116, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.732, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.76, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with a mechanical pencil you left here six months ago.

It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

I choose the mundane catastrophe of you every single time.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the fairy tale. Not the solved life. I'm offering Tuesday nights when we're both too tired to be kind. Years where money is tight and we eat pasta for two weeks straight. The inevitable day when you look at me and wonder if you chose wrong. The equally inevitable day when I wonder the same. And then\u2014this is the part that matters\u2014the next morning, when we choose each other anyway. Not because it's easy but because the alternative is unthinkable.\n\nI want to get old with you.

It's 4:47 AM. I've been awake since Tuesday. Time doesn't work right anymore. It pools in moments where you laugh and drains away when you're gone, leaving me gasping in temporal drought.\n\nI need to tell you something terrible: I was happy before you. That's the cruelest part. I had constructed a sufficient life\u2014books, silences, the reliable disappointment of myself. I was a master of small contentments. Then you walked into that caf\u00e9, apologizing to a chair you'd bumped into, and my careful sufficiency detonated. Now I'm radioactive with wanting more.\n\nThe truth isn't beautiful. The truth is that I catalogue your flaws like holy relics. The way you can't whistle. Your vendetta against cucumbers. How you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. That terrifying thing you do where you love people who don't deserve it, like me. I hoard these imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I haven't invented you from the wishbone of my loneliness.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning at my parents' house\u2014you were green, genuinely green, heaving into their heirloom vase\u2014my mother said later, \"She's not very sturdy, is she?\" And I thought: No, she's not. She's breakable and strange and apologizes to furniture and I would burn down the world to keep her safe. That's when I knew this wasn't love anymore. It was something more dangerous. It was recognition. Like finding my own kidney in another person's body.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. Leyi, \"enough\" is a word invented by people who've never watched you try to save dead houseplants with CPR. Who've never seen you leave voice messages for your grandmother who died three years ago because you can't bear to delete her number. You're not enough\u2014you're too much. You're excessive. You're what happens when the universe forgets to be careful.\n\nI've started to understand religion because of you. Not God\u2014that's too simple. But the holy terror of being chosen by something you don't deserve. Every night you choose to sleep beside me feels like a bureaucratic error in heaven that no one's caught yet. I wake up at 3 AM just to watch you breathe, to confirm the miracle is still happening, that they haven't recalled you for being incorrectly distributed to someone like me.\n\nDo you want to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's watching you eat cereal at midnight, milk dripping onto your constellation of a nightshirt, and thinking: I would die without this. Not metaphorically. Literally. My cells would forget their purpose. It's calculating the precise angle you tilt your head when you're about to cry and positioning myself to catch you. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday afternoons when you're just reading and I have to leave the room because the sight of you existing makes my chest cavity feel too small.\n\nThat Thursday when my father called me a disappointment again\u2014thirty-four years old and still his favorite failure\u2014you didn't say I wasn't. You said, \"Good. Disappoint him more. Disappoint everyone who wanted you small.\" Then you made me instant ramen, the cheap kind, and added an egg exactly the way sadness tastes better. How did you know that was the antidote? How do you always know which version of me needs which version of you?\n\nHere's my confession: I've already married you in every way that matters. In the quantum mechanics of my intention. In the cellular democracy where every atom voted yes. In the future that's already happened where we're old and you still can't whistle and I still love the trying. The ceremony, the paper, the ring\u2014that's just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nBut I want the paperwork. I want the evidence. I want to be arrested with proof of you. I want strangers to know that you, inexplicably, chose me. That Leyi Chen, who keeps fortunes from fortune cookies sorted by year, who practices arguments with houseplants, who still leaves one bite of everything \"for the angels\"\u2014that this impossible person looked at me, Warren Zhang, professional disappointment and amateur human, and said: him, I choose him.\n\nSo here it is, the violence of truth: Marry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word for this catastrophe. Marry me because I've already died and been resurrected by you so many times that my death certificate is basically fiction. Marry me because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014is a paradox that makes physics uncomfortable. Marry me because I bought your grandmother's thimble from your aunt and had it made into a ring, and if you don't wear it, I'll have to explain to a thimble why it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're already terminal with each other. This is just asking permission to name the disease.\n\nI am yours in the way that rivers are the ocean's\u2014inevitably, gravitationally, without other options.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's ordinary. You've made me unfit for any life but the one where you can't whistle and I love the trying.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. It's not 4:47 AM.

Here's attempt twenty-four.\n\nThe truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because \"I love you\" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened.

You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See?

I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

Last Thursday, while you were at work, I spent three hours watching videos of strangers' wedding proposals. Not for ideas\u2014for evidence that other people feel this too, this cellular reorganization, this complete betrayal of who I used to be.

It's about the 4,000 unremarkable hours between memorable moments. It's me knowing you'll read the ending of a book first when you're stressed. It's you pretending not to notice when I eat your leftovers. It's the way we've wordlessly agreed that the left side of the couch is mine and the right is yours, but the middle is ours. That's where love lives\u2014in the DMZ between two separate humans who've agreed to blur.\n\nI was somebody before you. I had opinions about wine. I remembered to eat breakfast. I could watch the news without wondering what you'd say about it. That person is dead now, Leyi. You killed him the day you absentmindedly held my hand during that terrible movie, not romantic, just reaching for something familiar in the dark. His last thought was \"oh, this is it. This is the trap. I'm done for.\" And he was right.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I am a man who googles \"how to know if cats are happy.\" Who practices speeches I'll never give. Who saves your voicemails in case technology fails and I need evidence you existed. I am clinically anxious, recreationally pessimistic, and I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days like a tumor I'm too scared to remove. Some nights I hold it up to the light and think about probability\u2014how many wrong turns led to the right one, to you, to this impossible now where you exist and somehow tolerate me existing beside you.\n\nRemember that morning you found me on the bathroom floor, panicking about nothing and everything? You didn't try to fix me. You just sat down on the cold tile and said, \"Okay, we're doing this here today.\" Then you started listing every bird you could name, alphabetically, until my breathing synced with your rhythm. Albatross. Blue jay. Cardinal. That's when I knew: love isn't about finding someone who completes you. It's about finding someone who makes being incomplete bearable.\n\nBut here's the thing that keeps me up at 4:47 AM: You're going to die. I'm going to die. These bodies are just rental units and the lease is non-negotiable. One day, one of us will be in a room without the other, holding nothing but neural patterns and ghost weight. This thought should terrify me. Instead, it clarifies everything. If we're both just temporary collections of atoms pretending to be people, then the fact that your atoms chose to orbit mine feels like the only miracle I need to believe in.\n\nSo here's my offer, stripped of romance: I want to synchronize our decay. I want to argue about thermostats and discover new ways to disappoint each other. I want to develop specific types of silence\u2014the comfortable kind, the furious kind, the kind that means we're both thinking about the same dead friend. I want to become so entangled that future archaeologists will have to invent a new word for what we were to each other.\n\nMarry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical imperative dressed up in poetry. Marry me because when you laugh at your own jokes, my pancreas does something unscientific. Because you've ruined every song, every street corner, every mundane Tuesday with your presence or absence. Because I want to be buried next to you, our bones finally honest about what they've been trying to say all along.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. Love letters are for people who think words can carry feeling. This is just evidence of a complete surrender. This is me saying: you won. Whatever game we were playing, whatever defenses I had, whatever person I planned to be\u2014you won. Now I'm just this anxious man at 4:47 AM, hoping the woman who owns his future tense will say yes to staying in it.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She married a man who couldn't read but memorized entire books so he could tell them to her. That's what I'm offering\u2014not literacy, but the willingness to memorize you, page by page, until I can recite you in the dark.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already relocated me. I'm no longer where I started. I live now in the country of loving you, and there's no valid passport back.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you asked if I thought we were meant to be. The answer is no. \"Meant to be\" implies intention, design, purpose. We're not meant to be\u2014we're what happened when two accidents collided and decided to call the wreckage home.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evaluation history and feedback, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current score of 0.6965 while maintaining authenticity and emotional depth.

The eraser is gone. You used it all up fixing crossword mistakes. This feels important somehow\u2014that even your erasures leave marks on my life.\n\nLet me start with what terrifies me: I understand now why people used to die from love. Not metaphorically. Literally. Your absence causes a specific pain behind my sternum, like my ribs are trying to grow around an empty space shaped exactly like you. Medieval physicians called it \"dying of a broken heart.\" They were right. The body knows what the mind won't admit\u2014that some losses are incompatible with continued function.\n\nBut you're not lost. You're here, reading this, and that's the second terror: that you'll say yes. That I'll get to keep you. That forty years from now I'll still be discovering new ways you pronounce words when you're sleepy, new foods you're secretly afraid of, new songs that make you cry in grocery stores. The prospect of that much happiness feels like standing at the edge of an ocean I'm not sure I'm strong enough to swim.\n\nTuesday. 2:17 PM. You were peeling an orange and said, abruptly, \"I don't think I believe in myself today.\" I wanted to tell you that I believe in you enough for both of us, but that's not true. I don't believe in you\u2014belief implies doubt. I know you the way I know gravity. You're not a theory. You're a law.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about marriage proposals: The ring is the least important part. What matters is this\u2014I've started seeing time differently since you. Not as days or years, but as a finite number of times I'll watch you brush your teeth. Maybe 14,000 more times, if we're lucky. 14,000 times watching you spit toothpaste and make that face where you check if you got everything. That's not enough. I need more data points. More mornings where you steal all the hot water. More nights where you tell me the entire plot of a book you're reading while I pretend I'm not falling asleep. More, more, more. I'm greedy for the mundane repetitions of you.\n\nMy therapist says I have an anxious attachment style. She's wrong. I have a Leyi attachment style. It's highly specific. Symptoms include: checking if you've texted while I'm mid-conversation with others, saving the voice message where you laugh at your own joke about dolphins, and an inability to throw away the grocery list you wrote on the back of a CVS receipt three months ago because your handwriting looks happy that day.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I watch you exist and feel furious. Furious that you were living an entire life before I knew you. Twenty-seven years of you laughing at jokes I didn't tell, crying over things I couldn't fix, learning to ride a bike or kiss or make coffee\u2014all without me. It's irrational. It's possessive. It's the truth. I want retroactive ownership of your past and exclusive rights to your future. I want to be grandfathered into every memory you have.\n\nBut I also want to earn you. Daily. I want to wake up every morning and re-win you through a thousand tiny victories: remembering that you hate the word \"moist,\" never using your coffee mug (the one with the chip that you claim adds character), knowing to be quiet but present when your mother calls and you speak in Mandarin and your voice gets younger. I want to deserve you in installments, one day at a time, until one of us stops breathing.\n\nThe night my grandmother died, she looked at my grandfather and said, \"I would have liked more time.\" They were married sixty-one years. Sixty-one years and her last words were about wanting more. That's what I'm offering you\u2014a lifetime of not enough. Because there's no amount of time that would be sufficient. We could have centuries and I'd still be asking for one more Tuesday.\n\nSo here's the data: You hum when you're nervous. You read the last page of books first when you're anxious. You still text your dead friend's number when good things happen. You're afraid of butterflies but not moths. You cry at every single Pixar movie, including the shorts. You've been carrying the same lucky penny since 2019. It's not lucky\u2014you just can't throw things away. You're the only person I know who apologizes to automated phone systems. You eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. You love me despite compelling evidence that you shouldn't.\n\nThat last one is the miracle. Not that I love you\u2014anyone with functioning neurons would love you. But that you love me back? That's the glitch in the matrix. That's the thing that makes me believe in something larger than randomness.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already moved me. Geologically. Tectonically. I'm a different landscape now. There are Leyi-shaped canyons carved through my center. Marry me because the alternative\u2014existing in a universe where you're not my wife\u2014feels like a clerical error I need to correct.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a circle in the fabric. Some days I forget it's there, and then I remember, and the remembering feels like discovering gravity exists\u2014sudden, crushing, absolutely true.\n\nI love you. Those words are too small. It's like calling the sun \"warm\" or the ocean \"wet.\" Accurate but insufficient. I love you in ways that require new words. I love you kaleidoscopically, ****ographically, molecularly. I love you past tense, present tense, subjunctive tense\u2014in tenses that haven't been invented yet for the ways I'll love you tomorrow.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the quantum entanglement of us. To the statistical impossibility that we've already become. Say yes to Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings and all the unremarkable moments where we'll practice being married until we're good at it, then keep practicing anyway because the practicing is the point.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say this letter is too long. You're right. But how do you compress a universe into an envelope? How do you write briefly about infinity? You don't. You just hand over everything and hope the weight of it means something. This is me, handing over everything. This is all my words, asking for all your days.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
