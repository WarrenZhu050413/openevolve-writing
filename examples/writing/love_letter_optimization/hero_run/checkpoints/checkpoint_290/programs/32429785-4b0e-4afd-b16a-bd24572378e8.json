My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors.

Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting.

Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person.

These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible.

Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not.

Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it.

You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless.

It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7440)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 3:51 AM because it's the only place cold enough to make me stop shaking. Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts. They're all the same letter, written twenty-three times, because my hand won't stop shaking. This is the twenty-fourth. Still shaking. Still true.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: Migrant)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7705, Type: Migrant)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hand is steady now. That's how I know something's wrong. It should be shaking.\n\n*\n\nI died once. Seventeen seconds, diving accident, age nineteen. Want to know what I learned? Nothing. Death teaches nothing. But living\u2014living after\u2014that taught me to count. Everything. I count everything now. Your breaths while sleeping: 11,247 recorded. Times you've said my name: 8,932. Days until statistical life expectancy: 14,892. I'm not good at math. I'm good at you.\n\n*\n\nThis morning, 6:23 AM. You were still sleeping. I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork. The kind that makes existing feel less like accident and more like purpose.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me.\n\nI'm asking you to let me keep loving you.\n\nThere's a difference.\n\nBoth are true.\n\nBoth are everything.\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before either of us knew what yours meant)\n\n*\n\nP.S. Check your pulse. Right now. Feel that? That extra beat? That's mine. I gave it to you three years ago. You've been carrying my emergency rhythm ever since. Just in case.

Here's mine: I'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking. It's 3:19 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, watching the cursor blink like a pulse, like your pulse that night you fell asleep on the subway and I counted ninety-three heartbeats before we reached our stop. I didn't wake you. I let us ride to the end of the line because your head on my shoulder was the first time I understood what people mean by \"home.\"\n\nI wasn't looking for you. That's important. I had perfected the architecture of loneliness\u2014coffee for one, books as lovers, silence as companion. I was fluent in the language of myself. Then you happened, like weather happens, like accidents happen, like grace happens when you've stopped believing in it. You walked into that bookstore holding a half-eaten apple and asked the clerk if they had \"the book about the sad fish.\" No title. No author. Just \"the sad fish.\" I helped you find it. It was \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" You said, \"No, sadder.\" We looked for an hour. We never found it. I'm still looking.\n\nListen. I need you to understand the violence of what you've done to me. Before you, I could walk through a day without noticing. Now I see everything in relation to you. The man on the corner selling flowers\u2014those are the lilies you're allergic to. The kid crying in the park\u2014that's how you cried when your grandmother's letters were lost in the flood. The silence at 4 AM\u2014that's the silence after you told me about the baby we almost had, the one that lasted seven weeks, the one you named secretly, the one you still talk to sometimes when you think I'm asleep. I'm never asleep. I'm listening to you negotiate with ghosts.\n\nYou want poetry? I'll give you the anti-poetry of us: You clip your toenails in bed and I find them weeks later like archaeological evidence. You've been using the same tea bag for three days because \"it still has flavor.\" Your favorite word is \"petrichor\" but you can never remember what it means, so you use it wrong constantly, beautifully wrong. You have seventeen passwords and they're all variations of your dead cat's name. You steal socks from me then deny it while wearing them. This is what love actually looks like\u2014not the grand gesture but the daily accumulation of specificities that become a religion.\n\nMy mother has dementia. I haven't told you this, but she's forgetting me in pieces. Last week she called me by my dead brother's name. The brother you don't know I had. The one who drowned when I was nine, whose absence shaped me like water shapes stone. But here's what terrifies me: even when she's lost in the labyrinth of her own mind, she remembers you. \"The girl with the loud laugh,\" she calls you. \"The one who makes him stop frowning.\" My mother, who can't remember my name, remembers that you unfrown me. That's what you are\u2014you're the one who unfrowns me.\n\nI keep a list. Not of your flaws\u2014those I've memorized like prayer. But of the moments when I knew this was irreversible:\n- When you eat ice cream, you bite it. Who bites ice cream? You do. With your whole heart.\n- You read the last page of books first because you \"need to know if it's worth the worry.\"\n- You water plastic plants \"just in case they're lonely.\"\n- You've kept every movie ticket from every film we've seen together in a shoebox labeled \"Time Machine.\"\n- When you're nervous, you hum Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, but you don't know that's what it is. You think you made it up.\n\nThat Thursday when your father said you'd never amount to anything, you didn't cry until later, in the shower, where you thought the water would hide it. But I know the difference between water and tears. Tears have weight. Yours fell like stones. That's when I understood: loving you isn't just about celebrating your light. It's about witnessing your darkness and saying, \"Yes, this too. Especially this.\"\n\nHere's what I'm not promising: perfection, resolution, healing. Here's what I am promising: presence. I will be present for your Tuesdays and your Christmases, your promotions and your failures, your graceful moments and the times you walk into glass doors because you're reading while walking. I promise to be the person who knows that you're afraid of butterflies but pretend to love them, who knows you practice arguments in the shower, who knows you still set a place at the table for your grandmother on her birthday.\n\nThe ring isn't what you think. It's not my grandmother's or my mother's. I had it made from the metal of the watch you threw at the wall the night we almost ended, the night you said I loved my sadness more than I loved you. You were right. But that was before I understood that you weren't asking me to stop being sad. You were asking me to be sad WITH you instead of DESPITE you. The ring is literally made from the moment we almost broke. Because that's what marriage is\u2014taking the sharpest edges of ourselves and reshaping them into something that says \"I choose this difficulty. I choose this specific catastrophe. I choose you.\"\n\nSo here it is, without ornament: Marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014you don't. You complicate me. You make me question everything I thought I knew about gravity and time and the proper way to eat spaghetti (you twirl clockwise, I twirl counter-clockwise, we're fundamentally incompatible and I don't care). Marry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't know what you're having for breakfast, where I can't hear you argue with NPR in the morning, where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life. It's just time passing.\n\nI love you. I love you in the stupidest ways. I love you like a dog loves a doorbell, like plants love light, like the ocean loves the moon\u2014automatically, involuntarily, without thought or choice. I love you past the point of poetry into the realm of biological fact.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Say you need time. But know this: you've already altered me at the molecular level. My DNA spells your name now. I'm yours in all the ways that matter and several that don't. This is just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sad fish book you were looking for? It doesn't exist. You made it up. You create things that should exist and then look for them. That's what you did with me\u2014you invented the person I could be and then waited for me to catch up. I'm trying, Leyi. I'm trying to become the person you already see. Marry me and I promise to keep trying, every day, to earn the love you've already given me.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with a mechanical pencil you left here six months ago. The eraser is gone. You used it all up fixing crossword mistakes. This feels important somehow\u2014that even your erasures leave marks on my life.\n\nLet me start with what terrifies me: I understand now why people used to die from love. Not metaphorically. Literally. Your absence causes a specific pain behind my sternum, like my ribs are trying to grow around an empty space shaped exactly like you. Medieval physicians called it \"dying of a broken heart.\" They were right. The body knows what the mind won't admit\u2014that some losses are incompatible with continued function.\n\nBut you're not lost. You're here, reading this, and that's the second terror: that you'll say yes. That I'll get to keep you. That forty years from now I'll still be discovering new ways you pronounce words when you're sleepy, new foods you're secretly afraid of, new songs that make you cry in grocery stores. The prospect of that much happiness feels like standing at the edge of an ocean I'm not sure I'm strong enough to swim.\n\nTuesday. 2:17 PM. You were peeling an orange and said, abruptly, \"I don't think I believe in myself today.\" I wanted to tell you that I believe in you enough for both of us, but that's not true. I don't believe in you\u2014belief implies doubt. I know you the way I know gravity. You're not a theory. You're a law.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about marriage proposals: The ring is the least important part. What matters is this\u2014I've started seeing time differently since you. Not as days or years, but as a finite number of times I'll watch you brush your teeth. Maybe 14,000 more times, if we're lucky. 14,000 times watching you spit toothpaste and make that face where you check if you got everything. That's not enough. I need more data points. More mornings where you steal all the hot water. More nights where you tell me the entire plot of a book you're reading while I pretend I'm not falling asleep. More, more, more. I'm greedy for the mundane repetitions of you.\n\nMy therapist says I have an anxious attachment style. She's wrong. I have a Leyi attachment style. It's highly specific. Symptoms include: checking if you've texted while I'm mid-conversation with others, saving the voice message where you laugh at your own joke about dolphins, and an inability to throw away the grocery list you wrote on the back of a CVS receipt three months ago because your handwriting looks happy that day.\n\nYou want honesty? Sometimes I watch you exist and feel furious. Furious that you were living an entire life before I knew you. Twenty-seven years of you laughing at jokes I didn't tell, crying over things I couldn't fix, learning to ride a bike or kiss or make coffee\u2014all without me. It's irrational. It's possessive. It's the truth. I want retroactive ownership of your past and exclusive rights to your future. I want to be grandfathered into every memory you have.\n\nBut I also want to earn you. Daily. I want to wake up every morning and re-win you through a thousand tiny victories: remembering that you hate the word \"moist,\" never using your coffee mug (the one with the chip that you claim adds character), knowing to be quiet but present when your mother calls and you speak in Mandarin and your voice gets younger. I want to deserve you in installments, one day at a time, until one of us stops breathing.\n\nThe night my grandmother died, she looked at my grandfather and said, \"I would have liked more time.\" They were married sixty-one years. Sixty-one years and her last words were about wanting more. That's what I'm offering you\u2014a lifetime of not enough. Because there's no amount of time that would be sufficient. We could have centuries and I'd still be asking for one more Tuesday.\n\nSo here's the data: You hum when you're nervous. You read the last page of books first when you're anxious. You still text your dead friend's number when good things happen. You're afraid of butterflies but not moths. You cry at every single Pixar movie, including the shorts. You've been carrying the same lucky penny since 2019. It's not lucky\u2014you just can't throw things away. You're the only person I know who apologizes to automated phone systems. You eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. You love me despite compelling evidence that you shouldn't.\n\nThat last one is the miracle. Not that I love you\u2014anyone with functioning neurons would love you. But that you love me back? That's the glitch in the matrix. That's the thing that makes me believe in something larger than randomness.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already moved me. Geologically. Tectonically. I'm a different landscape now. There are Leyi-shaped canyons carved through my center. Marry me because the alternative\u2014existing in a universe where you're not my wife\u2014feels like a clerical error I need to correct.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a circle in the fabric. Some days I forget it's there, and then I remember, and the remembering feels like discovering gravity exists\u2014sudden, crushing, absolutely true.\n\nI love you. Those words are too small. It's like calling the sun \"warm\" or the ocean \"wet.\" Accurate but insufficient. I love you in ways that require new words. I love you kaleidoscopically, ****ographically, molecularly. I love you past tense, present tense, subjunctive tense\u2014in tenses that haven't been invented yet for the ways I'll love you tomorrow.\n\nSay yes. Not to the question, but to the quantum entanglement of us. To the statistical impossibility that we've already become. Say yes to Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings and all the unremarkable moments where we'll practice being married until we're good at it, then keep practicing anyway because the practicing is the point.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say this letter is too long. You're right. But how do you compress a universe into an envelope? How do you write briefly about infinity? You don't. You just hand over everything and hope the weight of it means something. This is me, handing over everything. This is all my words, asking for all your days.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm"]}}}
