A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

To follow me following you. I needed proof I was as far gone as I suspected. His report, verbatim: \"Subject exhibits signs of severe psychological dependency. Spent seventeen minutes in Target sniffing shampoos to find client's brand. Cried during purchase. Recommend immediate intervention.\" I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.\n\nTruth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed.

It's closer to a 74 than an 80 because while brilliantly conceived, it lacks the effortless mastery and emotional purity of the greatest love letters, which achieve more with less self-conscious cleverness.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7390)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the dark because you're asleep next to me and I can't risk the laptop light. My thumb is cramping. Autocorrect keeps changing your name to \"Let\" which feels prophetic\u2014you are every permission I've ever given myself.\n\nTruth: I've been documenting us in ways that would qualify for a restraining order. Not photos. Worse. I have a spreadsheet tracking the mean temperature of your coffee over time (dropping 0.3 degrees per month as you trust me more). A histogram of your laugh frequencies (peak: 478 Hz when genuinely delighted, 510 Hz when being polite). I've been stealing your hair from the shower drain\u2014not sexually, scientifically\u2014trying to understand if loving someone changes their pH balance. Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: \"These people need help.\" She's right.\n\nHere's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.\n\nYou should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is \"just dormant\"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.\n\nBut here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is \"codependence.\" I say it's evolution\u2014my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named \"Levy,\" I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.\n\nI'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with \"She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream\" and I need that first part to be true.\n\nThe phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say \"epitome\" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.\n\nYours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the freezer. The color cards are in the violin case I told you I donated. I'm building a museum of you. The admission is free but the cost is everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7440)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the emergency room waiting area. Don't panic\u2014I'm fine. I came here at 2:47 AM because my heart was doing something wrong and I googled the symptoms and WebMD said I was dying. The triage nurse took my vitals, asked what happened, and I said \"I'm in love\" and she said \"Sir, this is a medical emergency\" and I said \"Exactly.\"\n\nShe didn't think it was funny. You would have laughed.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been documenting us without permission since Day 1. Not romantically. Clinically. Like a disease I'm tracking. Screenshot from March 3rd, 4:23 PM: \"Leyi used the word 'essentially' four times in one sentence.\" Voice memo, March 19th: \"She's singing to her coffee again. Off-key. Devastating.\" Excel spreadsheet, Column M, Row 847: \"Number of times Leyi has said she's not hungry then eaten all my fries: 23.\"\n\nI have 3,741 photos of you on my phone. You're only aware of maybe twelve. The rest are you existing: reading nutrition labels with religious intensity, arguing with NPR in the car, that thing you do with your face when you're trying to remember if you locked the door. My phone storage is 97% you. The other 3% is mostly screenshots of texts where you used my name unnecessarily. \"Good night, Warren.\" Why did you need to add my name? You've destroyed me with punctuation.\n\nHere's something ugly: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. I imagine you leaving, meeting someone better (taller, can actually cook, doesn't check if you're breathing sixteen times per night). I practice being okay with it. I fail every time. Last week I made it four minutes before crying in the Whole Foods parking lot. A child saw me and asked his mom why the sad man was eating cheese straight from the package.\n\nWant to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Is it normal to save someone's voicemails in triplicate\"\n- \"Can you get physically addicted to how someone smells\"\n- \"Woman reorganized my bookshelf should I propose\"\n- \"Heart palpitations when girlfriend exists\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that love is a medical condition\"\n\nThe doctor just called my name. False alarm\u2014wrong Warren. But that split second where I thought I'd have to leave, stop writing this? My body rejected it. Physically. Like an organ transplant gone wrong, except the organ is you and the body is my entire life.\n\nYou're asleep right now. It's 3:14 AM. In six hours and twelve minutes, you'll wake up, check your phone, see I'm not there, and text \"where are you?\" with no punctuation because morning-you doesn't believe in punctuation. You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me. That's what you've reduced me to. And I'd choose this reduction again in every possible universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7525, Type: Migrant)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth: I have been dead for most of my life. Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you. You're reading it now because I finally realized: the fear of losing you by asking is nothing compared to the certainty of losing you by not asking. Come find me.

Opinions about cryptocurrency. A favorite coffee mug. Now I catch myself using \"we\" when the barista asks about my weekend plans. My therapist says this is \"enmeshment.\" I say it's evolution\u2014I'm becoming something new, something that didn't exist before that Thursday when you mispronounced \"Nietzsche\" and I fell in love with the way you refused to be embarrassed about it.\n\nYou want truth? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter seventeen times. The first draft compared you to celestial bodies, which felt dishonest because you're more like that specific shade of gold the kitchen wall turns at 6:23 PM in October\u2014completely ordinary until you notice it, then impossible to unsee. You're not my sun or moon. You're my Tuesday-morning-coffee-spilled-on-important-documents, my why-is-this-song-making-me-cry-in-Target, my sudden understanding that love isn't grand metaphors but the small betrayals of control.\n\nI love your impatience with slow walkers. The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper \"no\" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you. I survived 28 years without you; I'm demonstrably capable. I'm asking because I've tasted what living WITH you means\u2014the specific gravity of a shared joke, the archaeology of learning someone's past, the stupid courage of planning past next Thursday\u2014and I'm professionally addicted. You're not my other half. You're my favorite whole person, and I want to do taxes with you until one of us dies.\n\nIs that romantic? I don't know. But it's true. And you said that would be enough.\n\nYours (in the most logistically complicated way possible),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the sheep.

You asked for truth. Here it is: I've been rehearsing this moment since the day you told me your middle name and I realized I wanted to know everything\u2014every embarrassing yearbook photo, every nightmare, every reason you hate February.\n\nThe truth is I'm not sitting in my room anxiously. I'm pacing between the kitchen and the hallway where your shoes still sit beside mine, and every time I pass them I understand religion a little better. Not God\u2014just the terrible, necessary faith that tomorrow you'll need those shoes again.\n\nBefore you, I was complete in the way a dictionary is complete\u2014all the words were there but none of them meant anything. Now I can't even grocery shop without it becoming an act of devotion. I buy the expensive tomatoes you like. I avoid the cereal aisle because you cried there once, exhausted and human and perfect, because we'd fought about something so stupid I can't even remember what, only that making you cry felt like breaking my own bones.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you wrong. I love you like an amateur\u2014desperately, sloppily, without technique. I check your breathing at night like a new parent. I save your voicemails in case the world ends and I need proof you existed. When you trim your hair, I want to collect the pieces like a grief-stricken Victorian. This isn't romantic. It's deranged. But it's also the truest thing I've ever been.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too obvious. What terrifies me is that you've made me someone who cannot be satisfied with less than this specific frequency of morning, where you put too much cream in your coffee and defend it like a dissertation. You've ruined me for every alternate timeline where we're strangers passing in some other life's grocery store, both buying the wrong tomatoes, neither of us crying in the cereal aisle.\n\nI used to think my life was a rough draft. Turns out it was just the margins\u2014all the space waiting for your annotations. Now you've written yourself into every empty line, and even my silence sounds like your name.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I don't love you because you're perfect. Perfect would be easier to survive. I love you because you eat yogurt with a fork when all the spoons are dirty. Because you name your bruises. Because when you're happy, really happy, you look surprised by it, like joy is a bird that accidentally flew in through an open window and you're trying not to move so it won't leave.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in every action\u2014in the way I buy coffee filters we don't need because running out would mean you'd have to drink tea. In how I've memorized seventeen different ways to make you laugh, catalogued by severity of bad day. In the muscle memory of leaving space for you in bed even when you're not there.\n\nSo here's my offer, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Let me love you badly forever rather than perfectly for a while. Let me make the same mistakes until they become our traditions. Let me wake up every day and re-learn your face like it's a language I'm not fluent in yet but desperately need to speak.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is you've already moved me. Not romantically\u2014geologically. You've shifted my tectonic plates. I'm a different geography now, and all my rivers run toward you.\n\nI know you're probably reading this in that spot by the window where the light hits just right at 7 AM. I know because I've watched you read there exactly 247 times, and each time I think: this is it. This is the whole point. Not happiness\u2014that's just weather. But this, watching you exist in morning light, unaware of your own holiness.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I could, it would just be a kind of death I'd have to do awake. Marry me because when I imagine explaining to the universe why I existed, the only answer I have is: to love you correctly, or at least to fail at it with total commitment.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in every way that matters, in every way that terrifies me, in every way that makes me believe we're all just atoms trying to remember what star we came from. And I remember. You're the star. You've always been the star.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. That sound you make when you stretch in the morning?

Starting with the end: I've already married you seventeen times in the gap between heartbeats. The ceremony happens every morning at 6:17 when you make that small sound\u2014not quite a sigh, not quite a hum\u2014that means you're deciding whether to wake up or wage war against consciousness for five more minutes. I pronounce us married then. The universe officates. Your breathing is the only witness we need.\n\nNow the middle: I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But I was wrong about the math. Love is division\u2014I've been split open, and everything I was certain about has fallen out. Yesterday I found myself crying in the produce section because the bruised peaches reminded me of your knee that time you fell off your bike trying to prove you could ride with no hands. This is what you've done: made me unable to look at damaged fruit without thinking about mortality and mercy and the specific weight of your body against mine when you're too tired to pretend you're not tired.\n\nHere's what I need to tell you before the beginning: I love you like a medical emergency. Not romantic\u2014literal. My body has reorganized itself around the fact of you. My circadian rhythm now matches yours. My left hand has developed muscle memory for the curve of your hip. When you're gone, my skeleton doesn't know how to arrange itself. I become architecturally unsound.\n\nThe truth has three parts:\n\nFirst: I document you compulsively. Not in photos\u2014in cellular memory. The way you murder pronunciation of \"worcestershire.\" How you arrange pills by size, not schedule. Your vendetta against fitted sheets. The surgical precision with which you remove tomatoes from sandwiches. I'm building an encyclopedia of you, but it's written in a language only my body knows how to read.\n\nSecond: You've made me religious, but not about God. About small mercies. The miracle of your hair in my bathroom drain. The sacred ritual of you stealing my socks and returning them inside-out. The holy mystery of how you can sleep through sirens but wake up if I stop breathing for two seconds. I believe in these things the way some people believe in saints.\n\nThird: I'm terrified. Not of losing you\u2014that's too simple. I'm terrified that I'm not brave enough to be loved by you. That I'll always be catching up to the person you see when you look at me. You love me like I'm already forgiven for sins I haven't confessed yet. How do I live up to that kind of grace?\n\nBut here's what changes everything\u2014the beginning I saved for last: Two weeks ago, you talked in your sleep. Complete sentences. You said: \"The plants need water but wait until Tuesday.\" Then: \"Tell him about the green door.\" Finally: \"Warren makes my bones happy.\"\n\nWarren makes my bones happy.\n\nI've been trying to write you the truth ever since, but that's it, isn't it? The mundane, unconscious, absolute fact of it. Not my heart, not my soul\u2014my bones. The architecture of me is happy because of you. The framework. The part that holds everything else up.\n\nSo here's my proposal, delivered backwards like everything important: I've already chosen you in every future. Now I'm asking you to make it official in this one. Marry me because your unconscious mind trusts me with mysterious messages about plants and doors. Because my bones are happy too. Because love isn't actually addition or division\u2014it's multiplication. Every moment with you creates ten more I want to have.\n\nI'm not promising you poetry. I'm promising you the produce section and the broken peaches and the way I'll always cry at the wrong things but for the right reasons. I'm promising you that fifty years from now, I'll still be documenting the new ways you mispronounce things, still stealing the blankets back, still waking up at 6:17 to marry you again in the church of our bedroom while you decide whether consciousness is worth it.\n\nIt is. With you, it always is.\n\nYours from the end to the beginning and back again,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The green door\u2014I looked it up. In dream symbolism, it means new opportunities. Your sleeping mind was trying to tell me something.
