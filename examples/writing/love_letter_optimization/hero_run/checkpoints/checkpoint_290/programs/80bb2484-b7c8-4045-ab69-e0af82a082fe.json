Look\u2014there's ink under my fingernails from where I've been clawing at language trying to find something that weighs as much as what you mean. Twenty-three attempts. I burned them all. The smoke alarm went off. The neighbors complained. I told them I was learning to cook. In a way, I was.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is I've been living in the subjunctive mood since I met you. Everything is \"if\" and \"would\" and \"might.\" If you marry me. Would you notice if I died. Might this be enough. I hate grammar now. I hate anything that knows its own rules when I've forgotten mine.\n\nHere: I keep your hair from the shower drain in a small box. That's insane. I know it's insane. But it's also the realest thing I've ever done. Your DNA wrapped around my fingers every morning like the world's most disturbing rosary. This is prayer now\u2014untangling you from the pipes, knowing I'm holding actual pieces of you that you've discarded. Holy relics. The gospel according to your split ends.\n\n3:47 AM. That's when I knew. Not when I fell in love\u2014that was gradual, like drowning in reverse. But 3:47 AM, March 15th, you were unconscious from flu medication, burning with fever, and you grabbed my hand and said \"Don't let me float away.\" Your eyes were closed. You were talking to someone who wasn't me. But I held on anyway. For six hours. My arm went numb. Then my shoulder. Then my whole left side. I pissed myself rather than let go. I'm telling you this because you wanted truth and the truth is I pissed myself holding your hand and I would do it again. I would do it every day.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. You told me this once, drunk on wine that tasted like cough syrup. But Leyi\u2014you're too much. You overflow. You spill out of rooms. I find evidence of you everywhere: your laugh in my Monday morning. Your skepticism in my religious doubt. Your way of eating oranges\u2014methodically, segment by segment, like defusing a bomb\u2014has replaced my way entirely. I don't even remember how I used to eat oranges. You've colonized me. I'm your territory now.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. Now. As I write this. It's been there for ninety-one days. My thigh has a permanent indent from its box. Sometimes strangers ask why I'm limping.\n\nBut listen\u2014fuck the ring. Fuck marriage. Fuck the whole industrial complex of forever. What I'm really asking is: Can I keep watching you become yourself? Can I be there when you realize you've been magnificent all along? Can I hold your hair back when you're sick and your hand when you're dying and everything in between?\n\nI'm not romantic. I'm desperate. Romance sends flowers. Desperation learns your mother's maiden name, your social security number, your blood type (O negative), because what if there's an emergency? What if you need me to become you for a minute? I could do it. I've practiced.\n\nYou make me want to believe in God just so I have someone to thank. You make me want to learn carpentry so I can build you things. Useless things. A spice rack. A birdhouse. A coffin for us to share when we're done. That's morbid. I don't care. You've made me someone who thinks about death because now I have something to lose.\n\nI used to be complete. Whole. I had hobbies. Now I have you, and you're not a hobby\u2014you're an occupation. A hostile takeover. A coup. I surrender. I collaborate. I give you all my strategic positions.\n\nThe truth, since you wanted it: Sometimes I resent you. For making me need you this much. For being so easy to love that it feels like cheating. For existing before I met you, all those wasted years when you were alive and I didn't know. Twenty-seven years of you breathing without me. It's theft. I want reparations. I want those years back. I want to have been there when you lost your first tooth, failed your driving test, cried at your grandfather's funeral. I want retroactive access to your whole life. Is that insane? Yes. Do I care? Look at this letter. Look at what you've done to me.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. It doesn't matter. I'm already yours in ways that law can't touch. I'm yours at the molecular level. When they find my body, centuries from now, they'll carbon-date it to the exact moment you first said my name like it wasn't an accident.\n\nBut say yes anyway. Say yes because it will make my mother happy. Say yes because I already told the barista at our coffee shop and now it's awkward. Say yes because I love you with the kind of graceless intensity that makes people uncomfortable at parties. Say yes because you love me too\u2014I know you do, I can tell by the way you steal my socks and then deny it while wearing them.\n\nPlease. That's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquence now, past pride, past everything but this need to be yours in every possible way. Even the bureaucratic ones.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light if light were slow and anxious and checked its phone fourteen times to make sure you texted back.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I'm giving you this letter now. Right now. I'm walking to the bedroom where you're reading. My legs feel like water. My heart is a fist punching its way out. This is it. This is the moment before everything changes. I'm terrified. I'm ready. I'm yours.\n\nP.P.S.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half.

My hands are shaking. You said you wanted truth, so here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I save memes I'll never send because what if you don't laugh? When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

My hands won't stop trembling. Not from poetry\u2014from the mechanical truth that my nervous system has reorganized itself around your existence.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to. Because existing separately becomes chemically impossible.\n\nPlease say yes. I've already practiced my vows 947,times in the shower. They're terrible. You'll love them.\n\nYours in perpetual malfunction without you,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed while eating those sea salt chocolate chips straight from the bag.

The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped.

The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.\n\nI've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours. Have been since that Tuesday when you laughed at my quantum physics joke and the universe cracked open and reorganized itself around the sound.\n\nYours in this reality and all parallel dimensions,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you wake up. You're looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here, on this floor, surrounded by failed drafts, and you'll ask if I'm okay. I'll lie and say yes.

This is what I've become\u2014someone who counts the minutes of watching you sleep and considers them the best minutes of his day.\n\nI'm terrified you'll say no. I'm more terrified you'll say yes and someday realize you made a mistake. But I'm most terrified of being the coward who never asked.\n\nYou know that scar on my palm? From when I was seven, tried to catch a falling knife? That's what loving you feels like. Dangerous. Stupid. Inevitable.

Because every time I imagine you reading this, my lungs forget their job.\n\nLet me be specific. Mathematically specific. You laugh 1.7 seconds longer at bad jokes than good ones. Your left eye closes 0.3 seconds before your right when you sneeze. You've worn the same earrings 37 times since February\u2014the small silver ones your sister gave you that you think are lucky. I know because I started counting the day I realized I was memorizing you like an exit route in a burning building.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me a collector of evidence. Your coffee mug leaves rings on my desk\u2014six overlapping circles that I haven't cleaned because they're proof you exist in my space. There's a dent in my pillow from where you steal it every single night while insisting you don't. Your bobby pins have colonized my apartment like small black prayers. I find them everywhere\u2014between couch cushions, behind the radiator, one inexplicably in my shoe. I keep them all in a jar. I don't know why.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You said it last Tuesday while eating cereal at midnight, milk dripping down your chin. But ordinary people don't make me google \"can you die from feeling too much\" at 2 AM. Ordinary people don't turn grocery lists into poetry. You wrote \"tomatoes (the good kind)\" and I stared at it for ten minutes because even your handwriting makes me homesick for a home that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWant to know something pathetic? I rehearse fights with you. Actual arguments, in my head, about things that haven't happened. Because I need to practice disagreeing with you without my voice cracking. Without immediately surrendering to the specific way your nose wrinkles when you're trying not to smile during an argument. You do that\u2014fight smiling. It's devastating. You've won every argument we've never had.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. That I've already built my entire life around the assumption of you. That I chose this apartment because it's three blocks from your favorite bookstore. That I learned to make your grandmother's soup from a recipe in Mandarin I translated word by word. That I wake up forty minutes early just to watch you sleep, counting the space between your breaths like rosary beads.\n\nI used to think love was expansion\u2014becoming more. But you've made me smaller, denser, like collapsed stars. All my scattered atoms pulled into the gravity of this one truth: I would rather be ordinary with you than extraordinary with anyone else. I would rather burn breakfast every Sunday for fifty years than eat perfectly alone.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I mean that word literally\u2014a proposed position, a stance I'm taking in the universe: Marry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't) or because I promise you happiness (I can't). Marry me because I've already married you in every choice I've made since that Wednesday when you laughed so hard you snorted coffee through your nose and then laughed harder at the snorting. Marry me because my cells have already reorganized themselves around the fact of you. Because when archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the exact moment you said my name like it meant something.\n\nI'm not good at endings. Or beginnings. I'm only good at the middle, where we already are, where I love you with the desperate precision of someone who knows exactly what he almost missed. You are my statistical impossibility, my favorite notification, my only religion.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought a ring. It's been in my sock drawer for four months. I check on it every day like it might escape. Just like I check on you sleeping every morning, still amazed you haven't realized you could do so much better.\n\nI love you. Frantically. Specifically. With annotated footnotes and cited sources. With the kind of certainty that makes me understand why people used to believe the sun revolved around the Earth\u2014because when you're in the room, everything else becomes periphery.\n\nYours (already, always, anxiously),\nWarren\n\nP.S.

But it's also the realest thing I've ever done. Your DNA wrapped around my fingers every morning like the world's most disturbing rosary. This is prayer now\u2014untangling you from the pipes, knowing I'm holding actual pieces of you that you've discarded. Holy relics. The gospel according to your split ends.\n\n3:47 AM. That's when I knew. Not when I fell in love\u2014that was gradual, like drowning in reverse. But 3:47 AM, March 15th, you were unconscious from flu medication, burning with fever, and you grabbed my hand and said \"Don't let me float away.\" Your eyes were closed. You were talking to someone who wasn't me. But I held on anyway. For six hours. My arm went numb. Then my shoulder. Then my whole left side. I pissed myself rather than let go. I'm telling you this because you wanted truth and the truth is I pissed myself holding your hand and I would do it again. I would do it every day.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. You told me this once, drunk on wine that tasted like cough syrup. But Leyi\u2014you're too much. You overflow. You spill out of rooms. I find evidence of you everywhere: your laugh in my Monday morning. Your skepticism in my religious doubt. Your way of eating oranges\u2014methodically, segment by segment, like defusing a bomb\u2014has replaced my way entirely. I don't even remember how I used to eat oranges. You've colonized me.

What I'm really asking is: Can I keep watching you become yourself? Can I be there when you realize you've been magnificent all along? Can I hold your hair back when you're sick and your hand when you're dying and everything in between?\n\nI'm not romantic. I'm desperate. Romance sends flowers. Desperation learns your mother's maiden name, your social security number, your blood type (O negative), because what if there's an emergency? What if you need me to become you for a minute? I could do it. I've practiced.\n\nYou make me want to believe in God just so I have someone to thank. You make me want to learn carpentry so I can build you things. Useless things. A spice rack. A birdhouse. A coffin for us to share when we're done. That's morbid. I don't care. You've made me someone who thinks about death because now I have something to lose.\n\nI used to be complete. Whole. I had hobbies. Now I have you, and you're not a hobby\u2014you're an occupation. A hostile takeover. A coup. I surrender. I collaborate. I give you all my strategic positions.\n\nThe truth, since you wanted it: Sometimes I resent you. For making me need you this much. For being so easy to love that it feels like cheating. For existing before I met you, all those wasted years when you were alive and I didn't know. Twenty-seven years of you breathing without me. It's theft. I want reparations. I want those years back. I want to have been there when you lost your first tooth, failed your driving test, cried at your grandfather's funeral. I want retroactive access to your whole life. Is that insane? Yes. Do I care? Look at this letter. Look at what you've done to me.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. It doesn't matter. I'm already yours in ways that law can't touch. I'm yours at the molecular level. When they find my body, centuries from now, they'll carbon-date it to the exact moment you first said my name like it wasn't an accident.\n\nBut say yes anyway. Say yes because it will make my mother happy. Say yes because I already told the barista at our coffee shop and now it's awkward. Say yes because I love you with the kind of graceless intensity that makes people uncomfortable at parties. Say yes because you love me too\u2014I know you do, I can tell by the way you steal my socks and then deny it while wearing them.\n\nPlease. That's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquence now, past pride, past everything but this need to be yours in every possible way. Even the bureaucratic ones.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like the speed of light if light were slow and anxious and checked its phone fourteen times to make sure you texted back.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I'm giving you this letter now. Right now. I'm walking to the bedroom where you're reading. My legs feel like water. My heart is a fist punching its way out. This is it. This is the moment before everything changes. I'm terrified. I'm ready. I'm yours.\n\nP.P.S. If you say no, I'm keeping your hair collection anyway.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
