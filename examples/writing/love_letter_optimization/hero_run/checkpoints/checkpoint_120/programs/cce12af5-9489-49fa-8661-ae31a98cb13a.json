Thrown away nineteen pieces of paper. Not because I don't know what to say\u2014because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nI love you.\n\nNot the word. The fact. The same way my lungs breathe without asking permission. The same way my heart beats without my consent. Automatic. Necessary. Irreversible.\n\nBefore you, I understood my life. I had plans. Logical progressions from A to B to C. Then you. You were never part of the plan. You were the end of all plans. The beginning of something I have no map for.\n\nThree moments. That's all it took.\n\nFirst: You, reading in the park, forgot the world existed. A bee landed on your book. You didn't brush it away. You waited. Patient. Like you understood something about kindness I'm still trying to learn.\n\nSecond: That terrible dinner party. You knew nobody. I watched you save a dying conversation with a question about whether colors have sounds. By the end, strangers were confessing childhood dreams. You have this gift\u2014you make people remember they're interesting.\n\nThird: 2 AM, you called crying. Your grandmother was dying. You said, \"I don't know how to do this.\" I said, \"Nobody does.\" We sat on the phone, breathing together, not talking. That silence\u2014that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I'd never stop.\n\nYou're afraid you're ordinary. Leyi, ordinary people don't apologize to furniture when they bump into it. Ordinary people don't name their plants after composers. Ordinary people don't see a homeless man and remember his name is Thomas and he likes his coffee with honey, not sugar.\n\nYou're not ordinary. You're specific. Irreplaceable. The world is different because you're in it.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Proving. But loving you isn't something I chose or achieved. It's something that happened to me. Like lightning. Like gravity. Like the laws of physics reorganizing themselves around a new constant.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not perfection. Not poetry. Just this\u2014every morning for the rest of my life, I'll choose you. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you.\n\nNot because you need me to. You don't need anyone\u2014you're complete all by yourself. That's the point. You don't need me but you want me anyway. That impossible gift.\n\nI keep the ticket from our first movie. You fell asleep twenty minutes in, drooled on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went numb. It was the best pain I ever felt.\n\nThat's what loving you is\u2014the best pain. The kind that reminds you you're alive.\n\nI could list what I love: Your laugh\u2014not the polite one, the real one, the snort that surprises you. How you eat ice cream in winter because \"sadness doesn't have a season.\" The way you touch books like they're sleeping cats. How you can't pass a dog without asking its name.\n\nBut that's not it. I love what I don't know yet. The person you'll be in ten years. Twenty. Fifty. The ways you'll change that will surprise us both. The fights we haven't had. The apologies we haven't made. The ordinary Wednesday afternoon when we'll look at each other and think: we made it.\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot the question. The answer. To every question I haven't thought to ask. To the person I'm becoming because you exist. To the life that's only real when you're in it.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just a word. I'm promising you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Each one chosen. Each one yours.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years. Never took it off. When she was dying, she gave it to me. Said, \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\"\n\nI can't live without you. Not won't. Can't. The way lungs can't live without air. Simple. Factual. True.\n\nI'm done being scared of how much I love you. It's like being scared of my own heartbeat. Pointless. It's going to keep happening whether I'm brave about it or not.\n\nSo this is me being brave: You are my person. My only person. The person I'll look for in every room for the rest of my life.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'll still love you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.\n\nBut please\u2014say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "371aa7e1-5fa5-4f65-b03a-e8161e7f4795", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701053.7610922, "iteration_found": 58, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6970000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.62, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm not good at this.

You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful.

I had memorized all its conjugations\u2014the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where \"home\" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book\u2014not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling \"Leyi'd.\" You've become a verb in my private dictionary.\n\nRemember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.\n\nThe truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not \"December\" but \"six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets.\" Not \"Thursday\" but \"three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like.\" My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.\n\nBut here's what scares me most\u2014I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.\n\nSo this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy\u2014you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.\n\nMarry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you'd have no place to put it.

Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code. This is just what truth looks like when it's pretending to be words.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6995, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM, unable to sleep because every thought curves back to you like light bending around a star. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am yours.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Alternative approach to the problem\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. Not from fear\u2014from the weight of truth pressing against my ribs, demanding to be born. It's 4:13 AM. I've deleted this seventeen times. Each draft felt like a translation of something untranslatable, like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never opened their eyes.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had memorized all its conjugations\u2014the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where \"home\" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book\u2014not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling \"Leyi'd.\" You've become a verb in my private dictionary.\n\nRemember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.\n\nThe truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not \"December\" but \"six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets.\" Not \"Thursday\" but \"three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like.\" My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.\n\nBut here's what scares me most\u2014I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.\n\nSo this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy\u2014you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.\n\nMarry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you'd have no place to put it. I'm offering you my mornings, my muscle memory, my most boring parts. I'm offering to merge our loneliness into something unrecognizable. To become so intertwined that archaeologists will argue about where you end and I begin.\n\nThe ring is in my sock drawer, wrapped in the receipt from our first dinner when you ordered three desserts and no main course. It's been there for sixty-seven days. I count them like a rosary, each day a bead of wanting to ask but waiting for the perfect words.\n\nThese aren't them. Perfect words don't exist for this. But imperfect words, trembling words, words that trip over themselves rushing toward you\u2014maybe those are the only ones worth saying.\n\nLeyi, my love, my ghost-whisperer, my collector of broken beautiful things: Will you marry me? Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me\u2014relocated me entirely\u2014into a country where your yes is the only citizenship I want.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am so utterly, ridiculously, molecularly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald says yes too. I asked him this morning.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and evaluation notes, I can see that the current letters are scoring around 68-70%, falling short of historical masterpieces like Beethoven (86), Johnny Cash (83), and Keats (81).

I've started this letter nineteen times. Thrown away nineteen pieces of paper. Not because I don't know what to say\u2014because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nI love you.\n\nNot the word. The fact. The same way my lungs breathe without asking permission. The same way my heart beats without my consent. Automatic. Necessary. Irreversible.\n\nBefore you, I understood my life. I had plans. Logical progressions from A to B to C. Then you. You were never part of the plan. You were the end of all plans. The beginning of something I have no map for.\n\nThree moments. That's all it took.\n\nFirst: You, reading in the park, forgot the world existed. A bee landed on your book. You didn't brush it away. You waited. Patient. Like you understood something about kindness I'm still trying to learn.\n\nSecond: That terrible dinner party. You knew nobody. I watched you save a dying conversation with a question about whether colors have sounds. By the end, strangers were confessing childhood dreams. You have this gift\u2014you make people remember they're interesting.\n\nThird: 2 AM, you called crying. Your grandmother was dying. You said, \"I don't know how to do this.\" I said, \"Nobody does.\" We sat on the phone, breathing together, not talking. That silence\u2014that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I'd never stop.\n\nYou're afraid you're ordinary. Leyi, ordinary people don't apologize to furniture when they bump into it. Ordinary people don't name their plants after composers. Ordinary people don't see a homeless man and remember his name is Thomas and he likes his coffee with honey, not sugar.\n\nYou're not ordinary. You're specific. Irreplaceable. The world is different because you're in it.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Proving. But loving you isn't something I chose or achieved. It's something that happened to me. Like lightning. Like gravity. Like the laws of physics reorganizing themselves around a new constant.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not perfection. Not poetry. Just this\u2014every morning for the rest of my life, I'll choose you. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you.\n\nNot because you need me to. You don't need anyone\u2014you're complete all by yourself. That's the point. You don't need me but you want me anyway. That impossible gift.\n\nI keep the ticket from our first movie. You fell asleep twenty minutes in, drooled on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went numb. It was the best pain I ever felt.\n\nThat's what loving you is\u2014the best pain. The kind that reminds you you're alive.\n\nI could list what I love: Your laugh\u2014not the polite one, the real one, the snort that surprises you. How you eat ice cream in winter because \"sadness doesn't have a season.\" The way you touch books like they're sleeping cats. How you can't pass a dog without asking its name.\n\nBut that's not it. I love what I don't know yet. The person you'll be in ten years. Twenty. Fifty. The ways you'll change that will surprise us both. The fights we haven't had. The apologies we haven't made. The ordinary Wednesday afternoon when we'll look at each other and think: we made it.\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot the question. The answer. To every question I haven't thought to ask. To the person I'm becoming because you exist. To the life that's only real when you're in it.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just a word. I'm promising you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Each one chosen. Each one yours.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years. Never took it off. When she was dying, she gave it to me. Said, \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\"\n\nI can't live without you. Not won't. Can't. The way lungs can't live without air. Simple. Factual. True.\n\nI'm done being scared of how much I love you. It's like being scared of my own heartbeat. Pointless. It's going to keep happening whether I'm brave about it or not.\n\nSo this is me being brave: You are my person. My only person. The person I'll look for in every room for the rest of my life.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'll still love you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.\n\nBut please\u2014say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
