You're upstairs, sleeping diagonally across our bed like you're trying to claim new territories. I came down for water twenty minutes ago. I've been standing here since, paralyzed by this thought: tomorrow you could leave, and I would spend the rest of my life trying to recreate the exact weight of your head on my chest.\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? I'll give you truth that horrifies me:\n\nI've been documenting you without permission. Not photos\u2014data. The 47-second pause before you answer when you're about to lie. The way you hold your breath for three counts before delivering bad news. How your left eye closes slightly when you're doing math in your head. I have a spreadsheet. An actual spreadsheet titled \"Leyi_patterns_v3.xlsx\" hidden in a folder called \"Tax_Documents_2019.\" This is who I am now\u2014a man who quantifies love because the alternative is admitting it's infinite and I'm finite and that fundamental incompatibility might kill me.\n\nLast month, you got food poisoning. You threw up on my vintage Nirvana shirt\u2014the one from the '92 tour, the one I've kept pristine for thirty years. And while you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was: \"This is it. This is the shirt I'll be buried in now.\" Because you touched it. Because your disaster became its history. I haven't washed it. I won't.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started experiencing you in the past tense while you're still present. Every moment feels like a memory I'm already nostalgic for. You're brushing your teeth and I'm already mourning the loss of watching you brush your teeth. You laugh and I'm pre-grieving the absence of that specific frequency. I'm haunted by you and you're not even gone. This isn't love\u2014it's prophetic grief. It's archaeological romance, where I'm excavating feelings for losses that haven't happened yet.\n\nI used to have thoughts that weren't you. I read books for their plots, not to find words you might like. I had opinions about things that weren't \"would Leyi agree with this?\" Now my entire inner monologue is just your name on loop, occasionally interrupted by panic that I'm saying it out loud. Yesterday, my coworker asked if I was okay. Apparently, I'd been unconsciously tapping out the rhythm of your name in Morse code on my desk for an hour. \n\nThe truth? I practice your absence. When you go to the store, I test myself: \"This is what it would feel like if she didn't come back.\" It's masochistic disaster prep for a catastrophe I'm manifesting by fearing it. I make mental lists of what I'd save if our house caught fire\u2014it's just you, repeated seventeen times, followed by the cat if there's time.\n\nYou know what broke me? Tuesday. You were peeling an orange and a drop of juice hit your glasses. You didn't notice. You just kept peeling, this tiny cosmos of citrus on your left lens, refracting light like the world's smallest sunset. I wanted to lick it off. I wanted to preserve it in amber. I wanted to call my mother and tell her I finally understood what she meant when she said love makes you insane. Instead, I went to the bathroom and sobbed for eleven minutes because somewhere, in some alternate timeline, there's a version of me who never saw you with orange juice on your glasses, and I pity him so much I can't breathe.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me understand those people who walk into traffic. Not from distraction\u2014from the terrible clarity that any reality where you're not looking at me is a reality I'm only technically participating in. My body shows up. It performs tasks. But I'm not there. I'm wherever you are, or I'm nowhere at all.\n\nI don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You've shattered me into so many pieces that I keep finding new parts of myself in places they shouldn't be\u2014my heart in my throat when you sing off-key, my lungs in my fingertips when I touch your hair, my entire nervous system reorganized into a seismograph that only measures your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 4:03 AM (twelve minutes of writing, a lifetime of feeling like I'm dying from loving you too much), I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in ways that probably require medication. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I need like I need you to keep stealing my socks and wearing them even though they're too big. Like I need you to keep mispronouncing \"specifically\" when you're angry. Like I need to keep finding your hair in my food and thinking \"yes, this is communion.\"\n\nMarry me. Not the person I could be, but this disaster who archives your breathing patterns and cries at citrus fruit. This man who has replaced his entire personality with loving you and considers it an upgrade. This wreck who would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't choose me back.\n\nThe cat just walked in. She's judging me. She knows I'm about to wake you up at an ungodly hour to give you this letter. She knows I'll probably cry. You'll probably cry. We'll both be exhausted and emotional and it will be the wrong time, the wrong way, the wrong everything except for this: it will be true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You've colonized me so completely that archaeologists won't be able to tell where I end and you begin. Which is exactly how I want to be found.\n\nYours in this reality where I'm brave enough to hand you this letter,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I hear you getting up. Your left foot always hits the floor first. In ten seconds you'll come down here, see me crying over a piece of paper, and ask if I'm okay. I'll say yes, which is both a lie and the truest thing I've ever said, because how can I be okay when I love you this much? But also, how can I be anything but okay when you exist and you're walking toward me and in a moment you'll be close enough to touch? This is the paradox I live in. This is the paradise I'm asking you to share.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "b9ca858f-f317-43f8-abe6-f39ed271667e", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701251.305088, "iteration_found": 80, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6594999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.68, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.62, "affective_force": 0.71, "literary_innovation": 0.58, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in our kitchen at 3:51 AM.

Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache.

What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human.

I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep.

Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to.

Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes.

I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

I carry it like a photograph in my chest, warm and constant.\n\nI love the small infinities of you: how you bite your lower lip when concentrating, the way you unconsciously hum Debussy while cooking, your habit of saving the last bite of dessert \"for later\" though later never comes.

Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful.

You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile.

Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring.

Because your disaster became its history. I haven't washed it. I won't.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started experiencing you in the past tense while you're still present. Every moment feels like a memory I'm already nostalgic for. You're brushing your teeth and I'm already mourning the loss of watching you brush your teeth. You laugh and I'm pre-grieving the absence of that specific frequency. I'm haunted by you and you're not even gone. This isn't love\u2014it's prophetic grief. It's archaeological romance, where I'm excavating feelings for losses that haven't happened yet.\n\nI used to have thoughts that weren't you. I read books for their plots, not to find words you might like. I had opinions about things that weren't \"would Leyi agree with this?\" Now my entire inner monologue is just your name on loop, occasionally interrupted by panic that I'm saying it out loud. Yesterday, my coworker asked if I was okay. Apparently, I'd been unconsciously tapping out the rhythm of your name in Morse code on my desk for an hour. \n\nThe truth? I practice your absence. When you go to the store, I test myself: \"This is what it would feel like if she didn't come back.\" It's masochistic disaster prep for a catastrophe I'm manifesting by fearing it. I make mental lists of what I'd save if our house caught fire\u2014it's just you, repeated seventeen times, followed by the cat if there's time.\n\nYou know what broke me? Tuesday. You were peeling an orange and a drop of juice hit your glasses. You didn't notice. You just kept peeling, this tiny cosmos of citrus on your left lens, refracting light like the world's smallest sunset. I wanted to lick it off. I wanted to preserve it in amber. I wanted to call my mother and tell her I finally understood what she meant when she said love makes you insane. Instead, I went to the bathroom and sobbed for eleven minutes because somewhere, in some alternate timeline, there's a version of me who never saw you with orange juice on your glasses, and I pity him so much I can't breathe.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me understand those people who walk into traffic. Not from distraction\u2014from the terrible clarity that any reality where you're not looking at me is a reality I'm only technically participating in. My body shows up. It performs tasks. But I'm not there. I'm wherever you are, or I'm nowhere at all.\n\nI don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You've shattered me into so many pieces that I keep finding new parts of myself in places they shouldn't be\u2014my heart in my throat when you sing off-key, my lungs in my fingertips when I touch your hair, my entire nervous system reorganized into a seismograph that only measures your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 4:03 AM (twelve minutes of writing, a lifetime of feeling like I'm dying from loving you too much), I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in ways that probably require medication. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I need like I need you to keep stealing my socks and wearing them even though they're too big. Like I need you to keep mispronouncing \"specifically\" when you're angry. Like I need to keep finding your hair in my food and thinking \"yes, this is communion.\"\n\nMarry me. Not the person I could be, but this disaster who archives your breathing patterns and cries at citrus fruit. This man who has replaced his entire personality with loving you and considers it an upgrade. This wreck who would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't choose me back.\n\nThe cat just walked in. She's judging me. She knows I'm about to wake you up at an ungodly hour to give you this letter. She knows I'll probably cry. You'll probably cry. We'll both be exhausted and emotional and it will be the wrong time, the wrong way, the wrong everything except for this: it will be true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You've colonized me so completely that archaeologists won't be able to tell where I end and you begin. Which is exactly how I want to be found.\n\nYours in this reality where I'm brave enough to hand you this letter,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I hear you getting up. Your left foot always hits the floor first. In ten seconds you'll come down here, see me crying over a piece of paper, and ask if I'm okay. I'll say yes, which is both a lie and the truest thing I've ever said, because how can I be okay when I love you this much? But also, how can I be anything but okay when you exist and you're walking toward me and in a moment you'll be close enough to touch? This is the paradox I live in. This is the paradise I'm asking you to share.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
