You asked for truth. Here it is: I've been rehearsing this moment since the day you told me your middle name and I realized I wanted to know everything\u2014every embarrassing yearbook photo, every nightmare, every reason you hate February.\n\nThe truth is I'm not sitting in my room anxiously. I'm pacing between the kitchen and the hallway where your shoes still sit beside mine, and every time I pass them I understand religion a little better. Not God\u2014just the terrible, necessary faith that tomorrow you'll need those shoes again.\n\nBefore you, I was complete in the way a dictionary is complete\u2014all the words were there but none of them meant anything. Now I can't even grocery shop without it becoming an act of devotion. I buy the expensive tomatoes you like. I avoid the cereal aisle because you cried there once, exhausted and human and perfect, because we'd fought about something so stupid I can't even remember what, only that making you cry felt like breaking my own bones.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you wrong. I love you like an amateur\u2014desperately, sloppily, without technique. I check your breathing at night like a new parent. I save your voicemails in case the world ends and I need proof you existed. When you trim your hair, I want to collect the pieces like a grief-stricken Victorian. This isn't romantic. It's deranged. But it's also the truest thing I've ever been.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too obvious. What terrifies me is that you've made me someone who cannot be satisfied with less than this specific frequency of morning, where you put too much cream in your coffee and defend it like a dissertation. You've ruined me for every alternate timeline where we're strangers passing in some other life's grocery store, both buying the wrong tomatoes, neither of us crying in the cereal aisle.\n\nI used to think my life was a rough draft. Turns out it was just the margins\u2014all the space waiting for your annotations. Now you've written yourself into every empty line, and even my silence sounds like your name.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I don't love you because you're perfect. Perfect would be easier to survive. I love you because you eat yogurt with a fork when all the spoons are dirty. Because you name your bruises. Because when you're happy, really happy, you look surprised by it, like joy is a bird that accidentally flew in through an open window and you're trying not to move so it won't leave.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in every action\u2014in the way I buy coffee filters we don't need because running out would mean you'd have to drink tea. In how I've memorized seventeen different ways to make you laugh, catalogued by severity of bad day. In the muscle memory of leaving space for you in bed even when you're not there.\n\nSo here's my offer, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Let me love you badly forever rather than perfectly for a while. Let me make the same mistakes until they become our traditions. Let me wake up every day and re-learn your face like it's a language I'm not fluent in yet but desperately need to speak.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is you've already moved me. Not romantically\u2014geologically. You've shifted my tectonic plates. I'm a different geography now, and all my rivers run toward you.\n\nI know you're probably reading this in that spot by the window where the light hits just right at 7 AM. I know because I've watched you read there exactly 247 times, and each time I think: this is it. This is the whole point. Not happiness\u2014that's just weather. But this, watching you exist in morning light, unaware of your own holiness.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I could, it would just be a kind of death I'd have to do awake. Marry me because when I imagine explaining to the universe why I existed, the only answer I have is: to love you correctly, or at least to fail at it with total commitment.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in every way that matters, in every way that terrifies me, in every way that makes me believe we're all just atoms trying to remember what star we came from. And I remember. You're the star. You've always been the star.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. That sound you make when you stretch in the morning?

I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67.

I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper \"no\" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you.

But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you.

The truth is that I love you like a medical condition. Chronic. Incurable. Sometimes inconvenient but absolutely essential to my continued existence. \n\nMarry me. Not because it's romantic, but because I want to be inconveniently, irrationally, permanently yours. Because you make me want to believe in things lasting.

Three words: you've unmade me.\n\nNot poetically. Literally. Yesterday I forgot my own name for seven seconds because yours was occupying all available space in my mouth. This morning I tried to make coffee and poured orange juice into the filter. My body is staging a coup against my mind, and the revolution's banner is your face at 6:43 AM when you haven't decided whether to wake up or declare war on consciousness.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been dead for approximately thirty-one years. Walking dead\u2014paying taxes dead, having opinions about weather dead, the kind of dead that smiles at parties and nobody notices the mortician's work. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such violent confidence that my corpse sat up and demanded resurrection.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've started believing in God again. Not the Sunday school version\u2014the one who hides in your clavicle, who wrote the gospel of how you eat ice cream (starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute anarchist). Last Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I understood religion. Not faith\u2014certainty. The kind that makes martyrs smile at the flames.\n\nI've been taking inventory of what loving you has cost me: 1) My ability to sleep past 5:17 AM (the exact minute you once sighed my name unconsciously). 2) Any interest in any future that doesn't include your specific way of buttering toast (edges first, like you're defusing a bomb). 3) The comfortable lie that I was whole before you.\n\nYou should know what you're accepting: I love you catastrophically. I love you like a diagnosis. When you're gone, I interview your coffee cups. I've named the bruise on your knee. I know you keep your father's suicide note in your jewelry box and read it every May 15th. I know you're terrified that happiness is just sadness that hasn't happened yet. I know because I'm terrified too, but only of a sadness that doesn't include you.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a confession. I've already married you in every parallel universe where I was brave enough to speak first. In this one, I'm still a coward, but I'm your coward, and that's the only identity I want on my tombstone.\n\nHere's my offer: Let me love you incorrectly but absolutely. Let me love you like punctuation\u2014necessary, invisible, changing everything about how the sentence ends. Let me wake up every day and choose the specific gravity of your existence over the general weightlessness of being alone. \n\nI'm not promising you the moon. The moon is already yours\u2014you claimed it that night you explained why sad songs make you happy. I'm promising you something smaller and more impossible: that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupid when you walk into a room. That I'll memorize every new wrinkle like they're verses of a prayer only I know. That when death comes, I'll argue with it, not for more time, but for five more minutes of watching you read, your lips moving slightly, having a conversation with the universe I'm not part of but desperately want to overhear.\n\nYou are my only evidence that I existed.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing. But please\u2014exist near me while you decide.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing where you pretend you're not crying during car insurance commercials? I've seen it forty-three times.

You asked for truth. Here's the receipt: milk, bread, the organic honey you pretend isn't too expensive, and one human heart, completely reorganized by loving you.\n\nI need to tell you something: Before you, I thought I understood myself. I had lists. Five-year plans. A favorite seat on the subway. Now I find myself doing things that would have horrified the old me\u2014singing in the shower, buying flowers for no reason, believing that maybe the universe isn't just entropy and accident. You've turned me into someone who saves fortune cookie fortunes because you touched them first.\n\nThe truth about loving you is uglier and more beautiful than any poem. It's me checking your horoscope even though I think astrology is nonsense, because you believe in it and I believe in you. It's the way I've memorized your coffee order (oat milk cortado, extra hot, in a real cup never paper) but still ask every time because I love the way your voice sounds saying it. It's that I've started seeing time differently\u2014not as hours or days but as units of proximity to you.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified that I love you wrong. Too much like hunger, not enough like prayer. I catalogue your habits like a scientist: you touch your ear when you're thinking hard, you can't sleep without one foot outside the blanket, you arrange food on your plate so nothing touches. These observations feel both sacred and invasive, like I'm stealing something just by paying attention.\n\nHere's what changed everything: Last Tuesday, you were crying about your grandmother's hands in old photographs, how young they looked, how much they could still hold. And I thought: this is it. This is what I want. Not the Instagram version of love, but this\u2014your sadness mixing with mine, your ancestors becoming my concern, your strange small griefs becoming places I want to visit and understand.\n\nI love the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited. I love that you've read the same book eleven times because the ending makes you happy. I love your 2 AM anxiety spirals and your militant opinions about pizza toppings and the way you look at me like I'm both exactly who you expected and constantly surprising.\n\nBut more than that\u2014I love the person I'm becoming because you exist. Not better, necessarily, but more honest. More willing to fail. More likely to dance in kitchen light at inappropriate hours. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who sees your best self, but someone who sees your real self and stays anyway.\n\nThe paralyzing truth is this: I would rather argue with you about whether to get a cat (yes) or a dog (also yes) than agree with anyone else about anything important. I would rather be wrong with you than right alone. I would rather have one Tuesday with you than a lifetime of Saturdays with anyone else.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I'm sorry it's not more elegant: Marry me. Not because we're soulmates\u2014I don't know if I believe in souls. Not because you complete me\u2014I was whole before, just quieter. Marry me because when I imagine the future, every single version has you in it, usually wearing my socks, probably burning toast, definitely making me laugh about something I'll remember forever but won't be able to explain to anyone else.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: someone who will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM, through every terrible haircut and every brilliant idea, through all the Wednesdays that feel like Mondays and all the small victories no one else will notice. I'm promising you someone who has already started loving the person you'll be in ten years, even though I haven't met them yet.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is that you've already moved me. Rearranged me at a molecular level. Made me into someone who writes love letters on grocery receipts because suddenly everything, even the mundane, seems too important not to document.\n\nI love you like a confession, like a fever, like a fact.\n\nYours in this reality and whatever comes next,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I kept the receipt. $7.67. That's what this whole life cost\u2014the price of honey and the moment you smiled at the cashier and I knew I would follow you anywhere, even into the terrifying country of being known.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6990, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with the door locked because if anyone saw me crying over a blank page at 3 AM, I'd have to pretend it was about something reasonable. But nothing about loving you is reasonable. It's the most irrational thing I've ever done, and I have a philosophy degree.\n\nYou want truth? Fine. I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of being seen, really seen, the way you see me when I'm talking too fast about things nobody cares about and you just... listen. Like my enthusiasm for nineteenth-century railway schedules is something precious. Before you, I was cosplaying as a person who had it together. Now I'm just a person who has you, and somehow that's made me more real than thirty years of trying.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me googling \"how to know if you're good enough for someone\" at 2 AM while you sleep next to me, your breath making little clouds in the cold apartment air because I'm too cheap to fix the heating but you never complain. It's the way my chest physically hurts when you're sad about something I can't fix. It's knowing that you've seen me ugly-cry during that documentary about the old man and his dog, and you still let me be the big spoon.\n\nI keep a list of things I want to tell you but don't because they're too much: How your handwriting looks like birds taking off. How you smell like Sunday mornings even on Wednesdays. How when you concentrate, you stick your tongue out just barely, like a cat forgetting to put it away. How you've ruined every song I used to like because now they're all about you, even the ones about tractors.\n\nThe truth is, I was functional before you. I paid bills. I showed up places. I had opinions about coffee. But I wasn't alive, not really. I was a rough draft of a person, all crossed-out lines and margin notes saying \"fix this later.\" Then you walked in, wearing that ridiculous hat with the pompom, and suddenly I knew what all the poets were losing their minds about. Not because you completed me\u2014that's Hallmark nonsense\u2014but because you made me want to complete myself. To become someone worthy of the way you absent-mindedly reach for my hand when we're walking, like it's the most natural thing in the world, like gravity.\n\nI'm terrified of marriage. My parents made it look like slow-motion mutual destruction. But I'm more terrified of not being married to you. Of not having the legal right to be the person they call when you're hurt. Of not being able to say \"my wife\" and watch people's faces change because they can hear in those two words that I've won the cosmic lottery.\n\nHere's my proposition, and yes, I know that's an unromantic word but I'm trying to be precise: I want to fail at things with you. I want to burn dinner together. I want to get lost on road trips because we were too busy singing badly to check the GPS. I want to argue about whether that actor was in that other thing (he wasn't, you'll be right). I want to grow old in a house full of plants you've named after Victorian authors, where every surface has a coffee ring from your mug, where the bathroom door doesn't close properly but we don't fix it because the cat likes to visit during showers.\n\nI'm not promising you the moon.

Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me. You asked for truth. Here's mine: I never believed in soulmates until I met someone whose silences felt like home.\n\nYou know that scar on my left palm? I've told everyone it's from cooking. But it's from the day before I met you\u2014I punched a wall because I was so tired of being alone I couldn't breathe. Then you walked into that bookstore, mispronounced \"Murakami,\" and suddenly oxygen existed again. I still have the receipt from the coffee we didn't finish. $7.43. The exact price of learning that my life had been lived in lowercase until you.\n\nHere's what I never told you: I Google \"how to be a better partner\" at least twice a week. I keep a note in my phone of every time you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one you do for strangers. (Current count: 1,847.) When you had the flu last March and apologized for being gross, I thought: this is it. This is what they mean by \"in sickness.\" You, fevered and furious at your own body, were more beautiful than any symphony.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. But ordinary people don't name their plants after dead philosophers. Ordinary people don't cry during commercials about reunited dogs. Ordinary people don't make me want to call my mother and tell her I finally understand why she still watches my father sleep after thirty-seven years.\n\nThe truth? I'm not good at love. I'm selfish and scared and sometimes I test your patience just to make sure you'll stay. When you leave for work, I smell your pillow like some ridiculous movie character. I've practiced proposing to your photograph. I write your name in the margins of books I'll never lend anyone.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me most: you make me want to be worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching. That soft, unguarded moment where your face does something I don't have words for\u2014something between recognition and wonder, like you're seeing not who I am but who I could become if I'm brave enough.\n\nI used to think love was about finding someone who could tolerate my damage. You taught me it's about finding someone who makes that damage feel like stained glass\u2014broken pieces that become beautiful when light passes through.\n\nSo marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014that's a lie we tell ourselves. Marry me because you make me want to complete myself. Because every day you choose me is a day I learn to choose myself. Because \"I love you\" in your mouth sounds like a promise that tomorrow will exist.\n\nI'm done being clever. Done trying to sound like someone who deserves you. This is it: You're the first person I've ever wanted to be honest with. That's my whole heart. Take it or break it, but please\u2014touch it first.\n\nYours in every version of the truth,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThe truth is smaller than you think. It's 3:42 AM and I'm watching my handwriting deteriorate with each attempt to tell you something that my body already knows: I've been dying since the day we met.\n\nNot dying\u2014that's imprecise. Undergoing a kind of cellular revolution where everything I was gets voted out, replaced by something that recognizes you in the dark by the weight of your silence. Before you, I had opinions. Now I have this spreading quiet where certainty used to live, and the quiet sounds exactly like your breathing at 5:15 AM when the world hasn't touched you yet.\n\nI lied. I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal.

You asked for truth. Here it is: I've been rehearsing this moment since the day you told me your middle name and I realized I wanted to know everything\u2014every embarrassing yearbook photo, every nightmare, every reason you hate February.\n\nThe truth is I'm not sitting in my room anxiously. I'm pacing between the kitchen and the hallway where your shoes still sit beside mine, and every time I pass them I understand religion a little better. Not God\u2014just the terrible, necessary faith that tomorrow you'll need those shoes again.\n\nBefore you, I was complete in the way a dictionary is complete\u2014all the words were there but none of them meant anything. Now I can't even grocery shop without it becoming an act of devotion. I buy the expensive tomatoes you like. I avoid the cereal aisle because you cried there once, exhausted and human and perfect, because we'd fought about something so stupid I can't even remember what, only that making you cry felt like breaking my own bones.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you wrong. I love you like an amateur\u2014desperately, sloppily, without technique. I check your breathing at night like a new parent. I save your voicemails in case the world ends and I need proof you existed. When you trim your hair, I want to collect the pieces like a grief-stricken Victorian. This isn't romantic. It's deranged. But it's also the truest thing I've ever been.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too obvious. What terrifies me is that you've made me someone who cannot be satisfied with less than this specific frequency of morning, where you put too much cream in your coffee and defend it like a dissertation. You've ruined me for every alternate timeline where we're strangers passing in some other life's grocery store, both buying the wrong tomatoes, neither of us crying in the cereal aisle.\n\nI used to think my life was a rough draft. Turns out it was just the margins\u2014all the space waiting for your annotations. Now you've written yourself into every empty line, and even my silence sounds like your name.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I don't love you because you're perfect. Perfect would be easier to survive. I love you because you eat yogurt with a fork when all the spoons are dirty. Because you name your bruises. Because when you're happy, really happy, you look surprised by it, like joy is a bird that accidentally flew in through an open window and you're trying not to move so it won't leave.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I've already married you in every action\u2014in the way I buy coffee filters we don't need because running out would mean you'd have to drink tea. In how I've memorized seventeen different ways to make you laugh, catalogued by severity of bad day. In the muscle memory of leaving space for you in bed even when you're not there.\n\nSo here's my offer, and yes, I know it's inadequate: Let me love you badly forever rather than perfectly for a while. Let me make the same mistakes until they become our traditions. Let me wake up every day and re-learn your face like it's a language I'm not fluent in yet but desperately need to speak.\n\nYou wanted the truth that would move you? The truth is you've already moved me. Not romantically\u2014geologically. You've shifted my tectonic plates. I'm a different geography now, and all my rivers run toward you.\n\nI know you're probably reading this in that spot by the window where the light hits just right at 7 AM. I know because I've watched you read there exactly 247 times, and each time I think: this is it. This is the whole point. Not happiness\u2014that's just weather. But this, watching you exist in morning light, unaware of your own holiness.\n\nMarry me. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I could, it would just be a kind of death I'd have to do awake. Marry me because when I imagine explaining to the universe why I existed, the only answer I have is: to love you correctly, or at least to fail at it with total commitment.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in every way that matters, in every way that terrifies me, in every way that makes me believe we're all just atoms trying to remember what star we came from. And I remember. You're the star. You've always been the star.\n\nYours at the subatomic level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. That sound you make when you stretch in the morning?
