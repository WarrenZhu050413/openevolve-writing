My hand is cramping from balancing this on my knee. The cat is staring at me like I've lost my mind. She's probably right.\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's mine: I've been documenting the disaster you've made of me. Tuesday: cried during your voicemail about grocery lists. Wednesday: told my code rubber duck about your laugh for forty minutes. Thursday: ate lunch at 3 PM because I was calculating how many times you've said my name (2,847, roughly). Friday: bought six boxes of your cereal because what if they discontinue it and you're sad? This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man who hoards breakfast foods against hypothetical sorrows.\n\nI know the exact temperature you like your coffee (147\u00b0F, I use a thermometer now). I know you cry during the credit sequences of movies, not the sad parts, because \"all those people worked so hard and no one reads their names.\" I know you've been secretly teaching yourself Mandarin on an app at 2 AM when you think I'm sleeping, whispering \"xi\u01ceo m\u0101o\" (small cat) over and over like an incantation. I pretend to sleep because your secret dedication to surprising my grandmother makes my chest feel like it's full of bees.\n\nBefore you, I understood cause and effect. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically addicted to someone's presence\" at 3 AM. The search results say no. My body violently disagrees. When you leave for work, my skin feels wrong for exactly 23 minutes. I've timed it. Multiple times. This is not poetry. This is data.\n\nRemember last month when you got that terrible haircut and cried for two hours? You looked like a beautiful dandelion that had been through a wind tunnel. I would have married you right there in that salon chair, surrounded by your fallen hair like some kind of bizarre wedding confetti. That's when I knew I was beyond saving\u2014when your worst moment became my favorite because I got to be there for it.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've already planned our entire life. Not the big things\u2014those are negotiable. The small ones. Sunday crosswords where you get all the pop culture clues I miss. The way you'll steal my reading glasses when you lose yours (you will lose yours). How we'll fight about the thermostat for forty years and I'll secretly adjust it when you're not looking and you'll secretly adjust it back and we'll both know and pretend we don't. The jar of your grandmother's pickled radishes I'll keep buying even after you admit you hate them, because the ritual of checking if we need more has become sacred.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for four months. It lived in my sock drawer, then my glove compartment, then my laptop bag. Now it's in my pocket always, because what if the perfect moment arrives and I'm unprepared? Except the perfect moment was that Tuesday you sneezed spaghetti sauce on my dissertation notes and we laughed until we couldn't breathe. Every moment since has been equally perfect and I'm drowning in opportunity.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, you could destroy me. You probably will. One day you'll realize you could have anyone\u2014someone who doesn't inventory your sighs, who doesn't practice his proposal to the bathroom mirror, who doesn't love you with the graceless desperation of someone who never expected to be chosen. But until that day, I'm going to love you with such catastrophic intensity that archaeological excavations will find evidence of it centuries from now. They'll carbon date my devotion and conclude it was excessive for the era.\n\nI used to have thoughts that weren't about you. Theoretically, those thoughts must have existed. I have no evidence of them now. My brain has been reformatted. You're the operating system everything else runs on. When I debug code, I hear your voice saying \"did you check for semicolons?\" When I make coffee, my hands automatically reach for your mug first. When I breathe, I'm just collecting oxygen to say your name with.\n\nSo here, on this bathroom floor, with my foot falling asleep and the cat now actively judging my life choices, I'm asking you to marry me. Not the man I'll become or the man I should be, but this current disaster who writes love letters on toilet paper because he couldn't wait for morning. Who has seventeen drafts of wedding vows hidden in a encrypted folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Who would rather die choking on these words than live another day pretending he's not already completely, molecularly, irrevocably yours.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent hurricane, you beautiful malfunction in my careful programming\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm surrendering. I've already been conquered. This is just the peace treaty.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I've already rewritten my source code around your existence. There's no rolling back this update.\n\nYours in every timeline where love makes people act this stupid,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you stirring. In twelve seconds you'll shuffle to the bathroom and find me here, surrounded by drafts, crying over my phone's notes app. You'll ask if I'm okay. I'll hand you this letter instead of answering. You'll read it sitting on the edge of the bathtub, and you'll cry at the part about your grandmother, because you always cry about your grandmother. I already love those future tears. I already love the way you'll say yes while calling me an idiot. I already love our entire ridiculous future.

When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human.

Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes.

Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to. Because existing separately becomes chemically impossible.\n\nPlease say yes. I've already practiced my vows 947,times in the shower. They're terrible. You'll love them.\n\nYours in perpetual malfunction without you,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed while eating those sea salt chocolate chips straight from the bag.

I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter.

Actually broken. Like last Tuesday when you went to visit your sister and I stood in our kitchen at 2 AM eating cereal from the box because making a bowl felt pointless if you weren't there to steal bites from it.\n\nI'm supposed to tell you how you complete me, but that's backwards. You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.\n\nDo you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.\n\nThat's disgusting. I know. But it's true.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.\n\nThis is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop. Because here's the worst part: I would rather scare you away with too much honesty than trick you into staying with too little.\n\nI need you to know - not think, not hope, but KNOW - that you are not my better half. You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.\n\nI will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.\n\nI am terrified you'll say no.

These stupid, perfect things have ruined me for anyone else. You've made me unfit for any life that doesn't have you in it.\n\nI don't know how to be romantic. I know how to be destroyed by you.

Thursday: ate lunch at 3 PM because I was calculating how many times you've said my name (2,847, roughly). Friday: bought six boxes of your cereal because what if they discontinue it and you're sad? This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man who hoards breakfast foods against hypothetical sorrows.\n\nI know the exact temperature you like your coffee (147\u00b0F, I use a thermometer now). I know you cry during the credit sequences of movies, not the sad parts, because \"all those people worked so hard and no one reads their names.\" I know you've been secretly teaching yourself Mandarin on an app at 2 AM when you think I'm sleeping, whispering \"xi\u01ceo m\u0101o\" (small cat) over and over like an incantation. I pretend to sleep because your secret dedication to surprising my grandmother makes my chest feel like it's full of bees.\n\nBefore you, I understood cause and effect. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically addicted to someone's presence\" at 3 AM. The search results say no. My body violently disagrees. When you leave for work, my skin feels wrong for exactly 23 minutes. I've timed it. Multiple times. This is not poetry. This is data.\n\nRemember last month when you got that terrible haircut and cried for two hours? You looked like a beautiful dandelion that had been through a wind tunnel. I would have married you right there in that salon chair, surrounded by your fallen hair like some kind of bizarre wedding confetti. That's when I knew I was beyond saving\u2014when your worst moment became my favorite because I got to be there for it.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've already planned our entire life. Not the big things\u2014those are negotiable. The small ones. Sunday crosswords where you get all the pop culture clues I miss. The way you'll steal my reading glasses when you lose yours (you will lose yours). How we'll fight about the thermostat for forty years and I'll secretly adjust it when you're not looking and you'll secretly adjust it back and we'll both know and pretend we don't. The jar of your grandmother's pickled radishes I'll keep buying even after you admit you hate them, because the ritual of checking if we need more has become sacred.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for four months. It lived in my sock drawer, then my glove compartment, then my laptop bag. Now it's in my pocket always, because what if the perfect moment arrives and I'm unprepared? Except the perfect moment was that Tuesday you sneezed spaghetti sauce on my dissertation notes and we laughed until we couldn't breathe. Every moment since has been equally perfect and I'm drowning in opportunity.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, you could destroy me. You probably will. One day you'll realize you could have anyone\u2014someone who doesn't inventory your sighs, who doesn't practice his proposal to the bathroom mirror, who doesn't love you with the graceless desperation of someone who never expected to be chosen. But until that day, I'm going to love you with such catastrophic intensity that archaeological excavations will find evidence of it centuries from now. They'll carbon date my devotion and conclude it was excessive for the era.\n\nI used to have thoughts that weren't about you. Theoretically, those thoughts must have existed. I have no evidence of them now. My brain has been reformatted. You're the operating system everything else runs on. When I debug code, I hear your voice saying \"did you check for semicolons?\" When I make coffee, my hands automatically reach for your mug first. When I breathe, I'm just collecting oxygen to say your name with.\n\nSo here, on this bathroom floor, with my foot falling asleep and the cat now actively judging my life choices, I'm asking you to marry me. Not the man I'll become or the man I should be, but this current disaster who writes love letters on toilet paper because he couldn't wait for morning. Who has seventeen drafts of wedding vows hidden in a encrypted folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Who would rather die choking on these words than live another day pretending he's not already completely, molecularly, irrevocably yours.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent hurricane, you beautiful malfunction in my careful programming\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm surrendering. I've already been conquered. This is just the peace treaty.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I've already rewritten my source code around your existence. There's no rolling back this update.\n\nYours in every timeline where love makes people act this stupid,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you stirring. In twelve seconds you'll shuffle to the bathroom and find me here, surrounded by drafts, crying over my phone's notes app. You'll ask if I'm okay. I'll hand you this letter instead of answering. You'll read it sitting on the edge of the bathtub, and you'll cry at the part about your grandmother, because you always cry about your grandmother. I already love those future tears. I already love the way you'll say yes while calling me an idiot. I already love our entire ridiculous future. It starts now.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
