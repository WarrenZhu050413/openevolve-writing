My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork.

You left it Tuesday. I've been wearing it like a tourniquet for whatever's hemorrhaging inside me.\n\n*\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been keeping receipts. Not metaphorically. Actually keeping them. Coffee, February 9th, $7.23. Thai food, March 15th, $34.89. That bookstore where we met, June 1st, $0.00\u2014because you insisted on buying the book we both reached for. I have 1,847 receipts in a shoebox. This isn't love. It's evidence for a crime I'm about to commit: asking you to marry someone who saves trash because it proves you were real.\n\n*\n\nI died once. Fourteen seconds. Training accident, never told you. Want to know what death taught me? Nothing profound. Just this: the last thing I thought wasn't about God or meaning. It was: \"I never learned her middle name.\" Then they brought me back, and the first thing I did was look you up. It's Marie. Leyi Marie. I say it sometimes when you're sleeping, like a prayer to keep you existing.\n\n*\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I've forgotten how to sleep without checking your pulse. Not romantically\u2014literally pressing two fingers to your neck at 2 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM. You caught me once. Said \"what are you doing?\" I said \"making sure.\" You said \"of what?\" I couldn't say: \"that the universe hasn't noticed what it gave me and taken it back.\"\n\n*\n\nTuesday, you cried at a video of penguins. Not sad crying\u2014joy crying. Your left eye first (always left). I filmed you secretly. Not the penguins. You. Your face doing that thing where happiness breaks through like light under a door. I watch it when you travel. Seventeen times last trip. My phone thinks I'm insane. My phone is correct.\n\n*\n\nWant more truth? I practice your eulogy. Different versions. Car accident: \"She sang off-key to every song and I would give my hearing to hear it again.\" Cancer: \"She fought like she argued\u2014irrationally, magnificently, until the universe gave up first.\" Old age: \"We had 19,847 mornings and I remember every coffee order.\" This is mental illness. Also preparation. Also love.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I love you at 6 PM on Wednesdays. In your fury at automatic sinks that don't sense your hands. In how you eat hamburgers (all toppings fall out, every time, you never learn). In your mother saying I'm \"interesting\" which means \"disappointing.\" In the way you'll look at fifty-three\u2014I can see it already when you squint at menus, those lines forming like maps to our future.\n\n*\n\nRemember the almost-accident? Interstate 90, that semi ran the red. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I saw death coming and my only thought was: \"not her, rearrange physics, take me twice.\" We missed by inches. You never knew. Kept singing. I pulled over to vomit from relief. You rubbed my back, thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday afternoon.\n\n*\n\nHere's the ugliest part: I'm not good enough for you. I know this. You know this. The barista knows this. But here's what they don't know: I love you like a dog. Not poetically\u2014literally. With the same desperate gratitude, the same terror of abandonment, the same belief that you're the best thing that ever happened to mammals. I would sleep by your door. I would learn any trick. I would forget my own name if you'd just keep coming home.\n\n*\n\nThe biological facts: My circadian rhythm synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes your cells as self (I had this tested\u2014the lab thought I was joking). My left ventricle literally changed shape. The cardiologist said \"love doesn't do this.\" I said \"then what's your diagnosis?\" He had none.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived 1,297 days including that Tuesday you thought I was cheating but I was actually learning to make your grandmother's soup (still can't\u2014the woman took secrets to her grave). Because in infinite universes, only this one has us both conscious, concurrent, and arguing about the thermostat.\n\n*\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014where you don't leave hair ties, where I don't save receipts, where your leftover pad thai doesn't disappear at 2 AM\u2014that's not a life. That's just time happening to someone else's body.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in your coffee mug. The chipped one you refuse to throw away because \"damaged things need more love, not less.\" I've been carrying it for two years. Some days it's all that keeps my pants up. Today it's all that's keeping me breathing.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an organ loves blood\u2014desperately, constantly, without any ability to do otherwise. The surgery to remove you would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a surgeon. She said \"that's not how bodies work.\" I said \"mine does.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nJust that.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe word that ruined all other words. That made my mouth finally make sense.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say it soon.\n\nMy cells are reorganizing, waiting.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. \u2014 You're crying now. Both eyes this time. I can hear you from the bedroom where I'm pretending to sleep but actually listening to you exist. Come here. Bring the ring. Bring your tears. Bring your righteous fury that I hid this from you. Bring your laugh that rearranges matter. Bring your yes. Please bring your yes.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 That receipt from the bookstore? Turn it over. I wrote something that day: \"Just met the reason I'll never sleep properly again.\" I meant it romantically then. I mean it literally now. Your breathing is the metronome of my consciousness. Without it, I'm just noise.\n\nP.P.P.S. \u2014 Your middle name isn't Marie. It's Lynn. But you smiled when I was wrong, and that smile is why I save receipts\u2014to prove moments like that happened, when you loved me despite my failures, which is the only kind of love that matters.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: High-Performer)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering.

Evidence of what you've done to me.\n\nExhibit A: Yesterday I watched you eat soup. Just soup. The way your breath made small clouds above the bowl, how you held the spoon like it might escape\u2014and I thought: this is how religions begin. With someone doing something ordinary until someone else can't breathe from watching.\n\nYou want truth? I've been dead before. Literally. Eleven seconds, cardiac arrest, training accident. Here's what death taught me: nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just black. No tunnel, no light, no peace. But when I came back, my first thought was your name. Not relief. Not fear. Just \"Leyi.\" Like my neurons were arguing with death itself: you can have the rest but not this. Not her name.\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM because I just realized something terrible. I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.\n\nThe truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I've practiced our first fight, our first loss, the first time one of us will betray the other with mortality.\n\nHere's my confession: Thursday. You were sleeping. Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.\n\nMarry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under\u2014the one you said looked lonely. Marry me because I need legal documentation that this actually happened. That you actually happened. To me.\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name existed)\n\nP.S. - I lied. I said I've been dead for eleven seconds. It was thirteen. I lied because thirteen felt too much like prophecy. Like those two extra seconds were me refusing to leave until I was sure I'd remember the exact shade of brown your eyes turn when you're about to cry. I remember. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThis letter begins at its end: Yes. You already said yes. In the universe where time runs backward, we've been married forty years. Our children are becoming younger. You're reading this letter for the last time before you unwrite it.\n\n*\n\nWhat is love? Wrong question. What isn't? The space between electrons. The pause before thunder. The specific weight of your absence\u20142.7 pounds. I've measured it on the bathroom scale.\n\n*\n\nInventory of things I've stolen:\n- Your pronunciation of \"library\" (you add an extra syllable)\n- The way sleep rearranges your face into childhood\n- Seventeen of your hairbands (I wear them on my wrist like prayer beads)\n- Time: 1,247 hours watching you sleep + 892 hours pretending to read while memorizing your movements + 73 hours in parking lots, building courage to text you\n\nTotal theft: One lifetime. Premeditated. No remorse.\n\n*\n\nThree moments that murdered who I used to be:\n\n1. October 9th, 2:34 PM: You explaining quantum entanglement while eating yogurt. A strand of hair caught on your lip. The universe split. In one version, I reached out to move it. In this version, I didn't. Both versions died of love.\n\n2. The hospital, your appendix surgery: They let me hold your hand during prep. You said, \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Then, softer: \"Just kidding. Leave everything. Let them know I was human.\" That's when I knew I'd marry you.\n\n3. Yesterday: You parallel parked perfectly while singing off-key Radiohead. I thought: This is how civilization ends. Not with bombs but with me, in a Honda Civic, suddenly understanding infinity.\n\n*\n\nThings I cannot say with my mouth but can write:\n\nSometimes I wake up and count the bones in your hand to make sure you're real. Twenty-seven. Always twenty-seven. The relief makes me nauseous.\n\nI've already written your eulogy. Also mine. In both, I lie about how we met. The truth is too ordinary: Tuesday, coffee shop, you complained about Wi-Fi. But ordinary is the holiest word I know now.\n\nWhen you cry, your left eye starts first. Always. I've built my entire religion around this fact.\n\n*\n\nThe physicist's proposal:\n\nConsider two particles, entangled. Separate them by galaxies. Disturb one\u2014the other responds instantly. This violates everything. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" He was wrong about the spooky part. It's just love. The universe is built on it. We're not metaphors for physics; physics is a metaphor for us.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: Not death. Tuesday, April 10th, 2089. You'll die first (statistically). I've already forgiven you for this. What terrifies me is Wednesday, April 11th, 2089. Then Thursday. Then the heat death of the universe, which will happen faster than those Wednesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's the legal part: Marry me for tax purposes. For hospital visitation rights. For the banality of shared dental insurance. Marry me for the DMV forms. For the mortgage applications. For the school emergency contact lists. For every stupid document that demands we declare ourselves in binary terms: single or taken. Let me check \"taken\" with the cosmic permanence of a black hole's event horizon.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for this:\n\nBecause I've memorized the GPS coordinates of every place you've laughed (37 locations and counting). Because I know you're afraid of butterflies but not moths (this makes no sense and perfect sense). Because when you sleep, you hold your breath for seven seconds every third minute, and I've learned to breathe in your rhythm so we're synchronized even unconscious.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is insufficient. The sentence structure implies subject/verb/object. But you're not object. You're the verb itself. You're the loving. The state change. The quantum leap between what I was and what I am.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- One ring (hidden in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about)\n- This letter (draft #\u221e)\n- A heart that beats in iambic pentameter when you're near\n- The rest of my Wednesdays\n- All my dark matter\n- Everything after the decimal point\n\n*\n\nThe beginning, which is also the end: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. We got married the moment you laughed at my stupid joke about entropy. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nBut if you need the ritual:\n\nWill you marry me retroactively? Will you make honest what we've already been living? Will you let me call you wife so I can explain to strangers why I look like I've seen God?\n\nThe answer lives in your left eye. Already crying.\n\n\u2014W\n\nPS: The ring is behind the mint chocolate chip. You'll find this note there too, because I know you're reading this while I'm at work, and I know what happens next: you, freezer, ice cream, tears, yes. Time isn't linear. We've always been married.
