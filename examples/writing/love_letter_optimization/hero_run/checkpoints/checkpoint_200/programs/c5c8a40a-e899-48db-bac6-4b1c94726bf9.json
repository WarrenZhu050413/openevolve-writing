Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you.

Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. \n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months.

I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work.

Not of thoughts\u2014of your sounds. The specific pitch of your yawn at 6:47 AM. The rhythm of your typing when you're confident versus uncertain (different by three milliseconds between keystrokes). The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted. I've been collecting you, Leyi, like evidence of God.\n\nYesterday you asked why I stared while you folded laundry. How could I explain?

Even the stars we named that August are already dead, their light just hasn't admitted it yet.\n\nYou want truth? I've been writing my wedding vows since our third date. They're hidden in a folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to. But they're all lies, Leyi, because the only vow that matters is this: I promise to keep failing at loving you properly, to keep falling short of what you deserve, and to wake up every morning desperate to fail better.\n\nSometimes I trace the geography of your sleeping face\u2014the valley between your eyebrows, the mountain range of your knuckles, the ocean of your breathing stomach\u2014and I think: I am colonizing you. But then morning comes and you open your eyes and I realize: no. You colonized me first. You annexed my thoughts, invaded my dreams, occupied my future. I'm not myself anymore. I'm a sovereign nation of two.\n\nDo you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was \"showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry.\" That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I've known that since you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me.

I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need. I will love you until the statisticians have to invent new numbers.\n\nLeyi, my pulse, my proof that time is real\u2014I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to let me continue this beautiful ruin of becoming whatever we're becoming. To let me keep this terror of loving you more than my body can hold. To say yes, not to a wedding, but to the continuation of this exquisite destruction where I lose myself a little more each day and somehow become more real.\n\nWill you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Now I keep your bobby pins. Seven of them, scattered through my apartment like breadcrumbs leading back to you. I can't throw them away. They're evidence that you were real, that you stood in my bathroom and pulled your hair back while telling me about your terrible day, and I thought: this is what I want. Not the grand gesture. This. You, annoyed at your hair, using my mirror.\n\nI've been pretending this is casual. It's not. When you leave, I replay our conversations looking for signs you'll stay. When you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one\u2014my chest reorganizes itself. I've started seeing time as before you and since you. There's no after you. My body rejects the concept.\n\nYou should know: I practice saying \"I love you\" in the shower. Forty-three times this week. The words are too small for what this is. It's more like: I've been colonized. You're in my syntax now. I make coffee wrong\u2014your wrong\u2014two sugars, no milk. I sleep on your side of the bed when you're gone. \n\nYesterday you parallel parked perfectly and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual beauty of you just functioning in the world, made me understand religion. Not metaphorically. I understood why humans invented gods: to explain this feeling of being destroyed by someone just existing.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified. Not of you saying no. Of you saying yes and then realizing I love you wrong\u2014too much, too desperately, like I'm trying to breathe through you. But I'm more terrified of the alternative: pretending this is sustainable. Pretending I can watch you leave every Sunday night and not feel like I'm being bisected.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a medical emergency. I need you to marry me because my body has already decided. My cells divided around you. My future conjugates only in relation to you. When I imagine any life where you're not there, my brain returns an error message.\n\nLeyi\u2014I don't have beautiful words for this. I just have the truth: you could ask me for anything\u2014my kidneys, my savings, my sanity\u2014and I'd give it without thinking. That's not romance. That's just fact. Like gravity. Like needing oxygen.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you but because I've already built my entire life around the assumption that you'll be there. Because I can't unmake myself from loving you. Because the thought of you reading this and saying no is survivable, but the thought of never asking is not.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. You cry at insurance commercials.

Not metaphorically\u2014literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

Not who\u2014what. You are the event horizon where my old self collapsed into something denser, stranger, more terrifying. I need you to understand: this letter is not romantic. Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. \n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

Not of thoughts\u2014of your sounds. The specific pitch of your yawn at 6:47 AM. The rhythm of your typing when you're confident versus uncertain (different by three milliseconds between keystrokes). The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted. I've been collecting you, Leyi, like evidence of God.\n\nYesterday you asked why I stared while you folded laundry. How could I explain? That watching you turn chaos into order\u2014your hands making those precise, economic movements\u2014was like watching the universe invent mathematics. That the way you paired socks (rolling them into perfect spirals) made me understand why humans invented the word \"sacred.\" That I wanted to build a cathedral around that ordinary Tuesday moment and worship there forever.\n\nI used to be brave, Leyi. I free-climbed mountains, debugged code at 4 AM, moved cities without looking back. But now? Now I check your breathing seventeen times a night. Not because I'm afraid you'll stop\u2014because I'm afraid I dreamed you. Because nothing this beautiful has ever stayed. My grandmother's roses died. My childhood dog ran away. Even the stars we named that August are already dead, their light just hasn't admitted it yet.\n\nYou want truth? I've been writing my wedding vows since our third date. They're hidden in a folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to. But they're all lies, Leyi, because the only vow that matters is this: I promise to keep failing at loving you properly, to keep falling short of what you deserve, and to wake up every morning desperate to fail better.\n\nSometimes I trace the geography of your sleeping face\u2014the valley between your eyebrows, the mountain range of your knuckles, the ocean of your breathing stomach\u2014and I think: I am colonizing you. But then morning comes and you open your eyes and I realize: no. You colonized me first. You annexed my thoughts, invaded my dreams, occupied my future. I'm not myself anymore. I'm a sovereign nation of two.\n\nDo you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was \"showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry.\" That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I've known that since you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me. We've been married in all the ways that matter. This proposal is just paperwork for a union that predates language.\n\nBut I need you to know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly. I will love you like a broken piano\u2014too loud, off-key, with three stuck notes that play even when you're trying to rest. I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need. I will love you until the statisticians have to invent new numbers.\n\nLeyi, my pulse, my proof that time is real\u2014I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to let me continue this beautiful ruin of becoming whatever we're becoming. To let me keep this terror of loving you more than my body can hold. To say yes, not to a wedding, but to the continuation of this exquisite destruction where I lose myself a little more each day and somehow become more real.\n\nWill you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Not from fear\u2014from the weight of finally telling you what my body has known since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder during that documentary about penguins. You drooled a little. I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me? Not because I deserve you (I don't), but because I've already started living in our future, and it's the only address I ever want to have.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I need you to know something before my courage evaporates with the sunrise: I am not a whole person anymore. I am a collection of moments where you existed near me, held together by the memory of your breathing.\n\nListen\u2014I used to have interests. Hobbies. Opinions about wine. Now I just have an encyclopedic knowledge of how your voice changes when you're lying (higher, faster, you touch your ear). I know you steal single socks from my drawer because you think it's less noticeable. I know you test if pasta's done by eating it, not throwing it, but you throw it anyway because your mother did. I know the exact temperature of your sadness: 97.2 degrees, slightly cooler than your joy.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning and threw up on my favorite shoes? While you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was\u2014this. This is what I want. Not the vomit, but the vulnerability. The way you let me see you turned inside out, literally and metaphorically. I threw those shoes away not because they were ruined but because I couldn't bear to clean them. They were evidence of the night you needed me absolutely.\n\nI've been lying to you. Every \"goodnight\" has actually been \"please don't die before morning.\" Every \"drive safe\" has been \"if you leave me alone in this universe I will never forgive you.\" When I say \"I love you,\" what I mean is: you have colonized me so completely that when you're gone, I walk around like an abandoned building. Still standing, technically. But nobody home.\n\nYou want the truth? Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan your funeral. Not because I want you dead\u2014Christ, the opposite\u2014but because I need to practice surviving you. I write eulogies in my head where I confess that you were the only real thing that ever happened to me. That before you, I was just killing time until time killed me back.\n\nI'm going to tell you about the dream now. The recurring one. We're old\u2014ancient, really. Your hair is white, mine's gone entirely. We're sitting on a porch that doesn't exist yet, and you're telling me about your day, except you're speaking in a language I don't recognize. But I understand every word because it's not about the words anymore. It's about the way your mouth moves, the specific gravity of your presence. And I wake up from that dream more rested than any sleep has ever made me because even my unconscious mind knows: this is it. You're it. The final answer to every question I didn't know I was asking.\n\nBut here's what keeps me awake (besides everything): You could leave. Tomorrow, today, five minutes from now. You could meet someone who doesn't memorize your breathing patterns, who doesn't save your grocery lists like love letters, who loves you in a normal, healthy way that doesn't involve planning imaginary funerals or writing marriage proposals on bathroom floors. And you know what? You'd be right to leave. I am too much. This love is too much. It's cannibalistic. It's pathological. It's probably in the DSM-5 somewhere.\n\nBut I'm asking you to stay anyway. To marry the disaster of me. Because here's the secret I figured out somewhere between loving you and drowning in it: This isn't mental illness. This is what mental health looks like when you finally find the person your atoms were trying to become. This is sanity that looks insane because the world isn't built for this kind of recognition, this terrible and perfect knowing.\n\nI love you like a medical condition. Chronic, incurable, progressively getting worse. I love you like a natural disaster that's somehow also the relief effort. I love you stupidly, recklessly, molecularly. I love you past the point of poetry into pure, animal need.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). Not because we're ready (we're not). Marry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is sustainable without documentation, without witnesses, without legal proof that yes, this happened, we happened\u2014is killing me in ways I can't explain to my doctor.\n\nMarry me because I've already built my entire life around the shape of you, and without you, I'm just a house with no walls. Standing here, absurdly, in the middle of nothing.\n\nMarry me because you already have. In every way that matters. In every way that counts.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in the kitchen. I know you're crying into your coffee. I know because I know the exact sound your breathing makes when you're trying not to sob.

Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you. You're reading it now because I finally realized: the fear of losing you by asking is nothing compared to the certainty of losing you by not asking. Come find me. I'll be in our kitchen, making coffee wrong\u2014your wrong\u2014waiting for my life to begin or end with your answer.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
