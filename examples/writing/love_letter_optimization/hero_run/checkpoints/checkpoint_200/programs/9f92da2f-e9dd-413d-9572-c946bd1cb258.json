It's 5:34 AM. I haven't slept. Can't sleep. Sleep is a country I can't find my passport to anymore.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I wasn't broken before you. That would be easier\u2014you fixing me, completing me, all those lies we tell about love. No. I was whole. Functioning. I had systems. Then you walked into my life carrying a dying succulent you'd named Fernando, asking strangers if they knew how to save it, and every system I'd built just... stopped. Like someone had pulled the plug on my careful ordinary life.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is ugly. Truth is that I've memorized the way you breathe when you're pretending to be asleep. Three shallow, one deep, repeat. Truth is I know you're lactose intolerant but you eat ice cream anyway and then curl into a question mark of regret. Truth is that last Tuesday when you said you were at your sister's, you were sitting in your car outside our apartment for two hours because you needed to be alone but still close to me. I saw you. I didn't say anything. Love is also knowing when to pretend you don't know things.\n\nThat night in the emergency room\u2014remember? You thought it was appendicitis but it was just anxiety wearing a different costume. The doctor said your body was eating itself from stress. You laughed. Said, \"At least something wants me from the inside.\" That's when I understood: you're not just carrying your own darkness. You're carrying your mother's disappointments, your father's unspoken grief, that terrible thing that happened when you were fourteen that you still won't name. And still, STILL, you make strangers smile on elevators.\n\nI need to tell you about the Thursday you'll never remember. You were drunk. Not cute drunk\u2014ugly drunk, saying things designed to make me leave. Testing how much acid I could swallow and still stay. You called me a coward wearing a brave man's face. Said I loved the idea of you, not the actual mess. Then you threw up on my favorite shoes and cried about climate change and the death of handwriting. I cleaned you up, put you to bed, and sat on the bathroom floor until dawn, thinking: This. This exact disaster. This is what I choose.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too simple. What terrifies me is that you'll stay but stop being you. That you'll sand down your edges to fit better in my hands. That you'll stop apologizing to furniture, stop crying at commercials for agricultural equipment, stop leaving voice messages for your dead grandmother's phone. I fell in love with your exact damage. Don't fix it for me.\n\nHere's what I'm not saying prettily: My body has reorganized itself around your existence. When you're gone, my left ventricle forgets its job. My kidneys process loneliness instead of waste. My skeleton becomes a question mark asking where you went. This isn't romance\u2014it's biology. You've become necessary to my physical functioning. Without you, I don't metaphorically die. I literally malfunction.\n\nRemember when you asked if I believed in fate? I lied. Said no. Truth: I believe in whatever cosmic accident put us in the same bookstore on the same Tuesday when you were buying a book about dying alone and I was returning one about living alone and we reached for the same pen to sign the credit card receipts. If that's not fate, then fate is just a word for the beautiful violence of statistics working in our favor.\n\nBut here's what haunts me at 3 AM when you're unconscious and perfect: In another version of this story, I'm braver sooner. I tell you on our third date instead of our three hundredth that you've ruined me for regular life. In another version, I don't waste so much time being scared of how much I need you. But maybe that's the point\u2014maybe we needed all that wasted time to compost into this moment where I can finally say:\n\nI don't want to marry you because I love you. I want to marry you because \"love\" is too small a word for this situation. What I feel is closer to gravitation\u2014a fundamental force I neither control nor understand but submit to completely. You're not my other half. You're the reason I realized I could be more than whole. You're the overflow. The too-much. The cup running over and making a mess of everything.\n\nYour mother thinks you're settling for me. She's right. You could have someone stable, successful, who doesn't alphabetize anxiety medications and rehearse phone calls. But you chose me\u2014the man who watches you sleep like it's a spectator sport, who has named the seven different ways you laugh, who would sell his organs in order of least necessity if you needed anything. That's not romantic. That's insane. But it's our specific insanity, and I want to make it legal.\n\nSo this is my proposal: Marry me. Not for the right reasons. For the real reasons. Because you can't whistle but keep trying. Because you eat sandwiches in a spiral from the outside in. Because when I have nightmares, you don't wake me\u2014you just match your breathing to mine until I find my way out. Because the alternative\u2014existing in parallel instead of together\u2014would be like voluntarily choosing color blindness.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's made from a fork from our first dinner when you laughed so hard you snorted wine through your nose and I thought: \"This. This is the soundtrack to the rest of my life.\" The jeweler thought I was insane. He was right. But it's our insanity, worn smooth by use, bent into a circle that means: no beginning, no ending, just the continuous fact of us.\n\nI could promise you forever, but forever is just time, and time is just something we made up to pretend we're not all temporary. Instead, I promise you this: tomorrow I will choose you. Actively. Consciously. Like picking the same song on repeat not because I've forgotten there are other songs, but because this is the only one I want to hear. And the next day, same choice. And the next. Until one of us stops choosing, stops breathing, stops being. And even then, whatever's left of me will keep choosing whatever's left of you.\n\nThis letter is too long. Too much. Too everything. Like you. Like us. Like the love that's reorganized my molecular structure into something that only makes sense in relation to you.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I'm already yours in ways that would require surgery to undo.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you asked if I think we're soulmates. I said I don't believe in souls. That was true. But I believe in whatever part of you recognizes the same part in me\u2014call it souls, call it atoms, call it the cosmic joke that made us both alive at the same time. Whatever it is, it's already said yes. The rest is just paperwork.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "26bdb5cd-5d4f-4e06-a154-e384858c396c", "generation": 5, "timestamp": 1756701416.696925, "iteration_found": 101, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.687, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.52, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking.

It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say.

I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi.

That's the cruelest part. I had constructed a sufficient life\u2014books, silences, the reliable disappointment of myself. I was a master of small contentments. Then you walked into that caf\u00e9, apologizing to a chair you'd bumped into, and my careful sufficiency detonated. Now I'm radioactive with wanting more.\n\nThe truth isn't beautiful. The truth is that I catalogue your flaws like holy relics. The way you can't whistle. Your vendetta against cucumbers. How you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. That terrifying thing you do where you love people who don't deserve it, like me. I hoard these imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I haven't invented you from the wishbone of my loneliness.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning at my parents' house\u2014you were green, genuinely green, heaving into their heirloom vase\u2014my mother said later, \"She's not very sturdy, is she?\" And I thought: No, she's not. She's breakable and strange and apologizes to furniture and I would burn down the world to keep her safe. That's when I knew this wasn't love anymore. It was something more dangerous. It was recognition. Like finding my own kidney in another person's body.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough.

Who've never seen you leave voice messages for your grandmother who died three years ago because you can't bear to delete her number. You're not enough\u2014you're too much. You're excessive. You're what happens when the universe forgets to be careful.\n\nI've started to understand religion because of you. Not God\u2014that's too simple. But the holy terror of being chosen by something you don't deserve. Every night you choose to sleep beside me feels like a bureaucratic error in heaven that no one's caught yet. I wake up at 3 AM just to watch you breathe, to confirm the miracle is still happening, that they haven't recalled you for being incorrectly distributed to someone like me.\n\nDo you want to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's watching you eat cereal at midnight, milk dripping onto your constellation of a nightshirt, and thinking: I would die without this. Not metaphorically. Literally. My cells would forget their purpose. It's calculating the precise angle you tilt your head when you're about to cry and positioning myself to catch you. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday afternoons when you're just reading and I have to leave the room because the sight of you existing makes my chest cavity feel too small.\n\nThat Thursday when my father called me a disappointment again\u2014thirty-four years old and still his favorite failure\u2014you didn't say I wasn't. You said, \"Good. Disappoint him more. Disappoint everyone who wanted you small.\" Then you made me instant ramen, the cheap kind, and added an egg exactly the way sadness tastes better. How did you know that was the antidote? How do you always know which version of me needs which version of you?\n\nHere's my confession: I've already married you in every way that matters. In the quantum mechanics of my intention. In the cellular democracy where every atom voted yes. In the future that's already happened where we're old and you still can't whistle and I still love the trying. The ceremony, the paper, the ring\u2014that's just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nBut I want the paperwork. I want the evidence. I want to be arrested with proof of you. I want strangers to know that you, inexplicably, chose me. That Leyi Chen, who keeps fortunes from fortune cookies sorted by year, who practices arguments with houseplants, who still leaves one bite of everything \"for the angels\"\u2014that this impossible person looked at me, Warren Zhang, professional disappointment and amateur human, and said: him, I choose him.\n\nSo here it is, the violence of truth: Marry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word for this catastrophe. Marry me because I've already died and been resurrected by you so many times that my death certificate is basically fiction. Marry me because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014is a paradox that makes physics uncomfortable. Marry me because I bought your grandmother's thimble from your aunt and had it made into a ring, and if you don't wear it, I'll have to explain to a thimble why it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're already terminal with each other. This is just asking permission to name the disease.\n\nI am yours in the way that rivers are the ocean's\u2014inevitably, gravitationally, without other options.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's ordinary. You've made me unfit for any life but the one where you can't whistle and I love the trying.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've started this letter nineteen times. Thrown away nineteen pieces of paper. Not because I don't know what to say\u2014because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nI love you.\n\nNot the word. The fact. The same way my lungs breathe without asking permission. The same way my heart beats without my consent. Automatic. Necessary. Irreversible.\n\nBefore you, I understood my life. I had plans. Logical progressions from A to B to C. Then you. You were never part of the plan. You were the end of all plans. The beginning of something I have no map for.\n\nThree moments. That's all it took.\n\nFirst: You, reading in the park, forgot the world existed. A bee landed on your book. You didn't brush it away. You waited. Patient. Like you understood something about kindness I'm still trying to learn.\n\nSecond: That terrible dinner party. You knew nobody. I watched you save a dying conversation with a question about whether colors have sounds. By the end, strangers were confessing childhood dreams. You have this gift\u2014you make people remember they're interesting.\n\nThird: 2 AM, you called crying. Your grandmother was dying. You said, \"I don't know how to do this.\" I said, \"Nobody does.\" We sat on the phone, breathing together, not talking. That silence\u2014that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I'd never stop.\n\nYou're afraid you're ordinary. Leyi, ordinary people don't apologize to furniture when they bump into it. Ordinary people don't name their plants after composers. Ordinary people don't see a homeless man and remember his name is Thomas and he likes his coffee with honey, not sugar.\n\nYou're not ordinary. You're specific. Irreplaceable. The world is different because you're in it.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Proving. But loving you isn't something I chose or achieved. It's something that happened to me. Like lightning. Like gravity. Like the laws of physics reorganizing themselves around a new constant.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not perfection. Not poetry. Just this\u2014every morning for the rest of my life, I'll choose you. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you.\n\nNot because you need me to. You don't need anyone\u2014you're complete all by yourself. That's the point. You don't need me but you want me anyway. That impossible gift.\n\nI keep the ticket from our first movie. You fell asleep twenty minutes in, drooled on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went numb. It was the best pain I ever felt.\n\nThat's what loving you is\u2014the best pain. The kind that reminds you you're alive.\n\nI could list what I love: Your laugh\u2014not the polite one, the real one, the snort that surprises you. How you eat ice cream in winter because \"sadness doesn't have a season.\" The way you touch books like they're sleeping cats. How you can't pass a dog without asking its name.\n\nBut that's not it. I love what I don't know yet. The person you'll be in ten years. Twenty. Fifty. The ways you'll change that will surprise us both. The fights we haven't had. The apologies we haven't made. The ordinary Wednesday afternoon when we'll look at each other and think: we made it.\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot the question. The answer. To every question I haven't thought to ask. To the person I'm becoming because you exist. To the life that's only real when you're in it.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just a word. I'm promising you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Each one chosen. Each one yours.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years. Never took it off. When she was dying, she gave it to me. Said, \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\"\n\nI can't live without you. Not won't. Can't. The way lungs can't live without air. Simple. Factual. True.\n\nI'm done being scared of how much I love you. It's like being scared of my own heartbeat. Pointless. It's going to keep happening whether I'm brave about it or not.\n\nSo this is me being brave: You are my person. My only person. The person I'll look for in every room for the rest of my life.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'll still love you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.\n\nBut please\u2014say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.6995)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM, unable to sleep because every thought curves back to you like light bending around a star. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

I've written and deleted this seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nThe truth: I was complete before you. That's what makes this so frightening. I had built a quiet, functional life. I knew how to be alone. I was good at it. Then you happened, and now I can't remember why I thought that was enough.\n\nYou should know who you're considering marrying. I'm the man who still checks if the door is locked three times. Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters. Because in the face of that absolute certainty, we get to choose what we do with the time between now and then.\n\nI choose you. Not the idea of you, not the future with you, but you\u2014this specific human who saves fortunes from fortune cookies in books, who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, who can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. I choose your mundane Wednesday self, your inconvenient sadnesses, your embarrassing enthusiasms.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for sixty-seven days. Some nights I take it out and practice this moment. But this isn't practice anymore. This is the real attempt, the shaking hands, the imperfect words. This is me, Warren, the anxious man who loves you with a specificity that borders on madness, asking you, Leyi, the woman who changed my understanding of time itself, to marry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you\u2014words are just words. But because you've already moved me. Physically. Molecularly. Into a different person who believes, for the first time, that he deserves to be loved by someone who eats sandwiches from the inside out.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. These are not contradictions.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the atomic structure of my existence. The rest is just paperwork.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I love you.

Here's attempt twenty-four.\n\nThe truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because \"I love you\" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald?

The world hasn't started lying to itself yet. In this honest hour, I need to tell you something that my body knew before my mind did: I was born twice. Once, thirty-one years ago, screaming and reluctant. The second time was in a bookstore on Clement Street, when you laughed at your own joke about Proust and time suddenly began moving in all directions at once.\n\nListen\u2014I need you to understand that this isn't poetry. Poetry is what happens when the truth puts on nice clothes. This is me, Warren, whose hands shake when cutting onions, who still sleeps with one sock on, who spent forty minutes yesterday watching you reorganize the spice rack and thought: this is it, this is the sacred text, this is what monks copy by candlelight.\n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of my own inadequacy like stamps. Here's the album: Every woman who left. Every job I didn't take. Every silence I filled with noise. I had made peace with being a rough draft of a person. Then you arrived and started reading me like I was already the final edition. Do you know what that does to someone who's only ever been their own harsh editor?\n\nYou want truth? Here: I am terrified that I've tricked you. That one morning you'll wake up and see what everyone else sees\u2014a man whose love is bigger than his life, whose dreams leaked out somewhere in his twenties, who writes code for companies that sell nothing to no one. But then you do something impossible, like yesterday, when you found me crying in the kitchen over my father's voicemail, and instead of trying to fix me, you just said, \"He sounds like you when you laugh.\" How did you know that was the exact thing I needed? How do you always know?\n\nI've started believing in time travel because of you. Not the science fiction kind\u2014the real kind, where every moment with you contains every other moment. When you sleep, I see you at eighty, mouth slightly open, still stealing all the blankets. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seven, same furious compassion, probably defending bugs from boys with sticks. All your ages exist simultaneously in your face. I'm in love with every one of them.\n\nThe truth is I've been writing this letter my whole life. Every book I read was research. Every song I memorized was practice. Every person I failed to love was teaching me the specific gravity of real devotion. I thought I was wandering, but I was walking to you. Even my mistakes were just clumsy choreography, teaching me the exact shape of the hole you would fill.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than rejection: acceptance. Because if you say yes, if you actually marry me, then I have to become someone worthy of that yes every single day. I have to wake up and earn you again at breakfast. I have to deserve you at 3 PM on a Tuesday when nothing happens. I have to be enough during tax season and stomach flus and the specific Tuesday in March when everything feels pointless.\n\nAnd I will. God, Leyi, I will throw my whole life at the project of deserving you. Not because you demand it\u2014you love me already, inexplicably, with my coffee breath and my father's temper and my inability to finish anything except crosswords. But because the alternative\u2014a life where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life at all. It's just time passing.\n\nSo here's my proposition, stripped of metaphor: I want to fail and succeed inside the container of us. I want to burn dinner together. I want our fights to have sequels. I want to develop inside jokes so dense and self-referential that we become incomprehensible to others. I want to merge our libraries and argue about shelf organization. I want to catch you eating peanut butter from the jar at midnight and pretend to be scandalized every time. I want the privilege of being the person you permit to see you without your face on, without your armor, in the holy ordinary of morning light where you are most yourself and most mine.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness\u2014that's your job, you're already good at it. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you change\u2014and you will, we both will, into people we can't imagine\u2014I will love each iteration with the same ferocity I love this one. I will love you like a verb, active and continuous. I will love you like time-lapse photography, seeing the whole arc even in the smallest movements.\n\nMarry me because I have already started. Because my cells have already reorganized around the fact of you. Because when scientists eventually map my genome, they'll find your name written in the junk DNA they thought was just noise. Because the alternative\u2014keeping this rings in my sock drawer for one more day\u2014might actually kill me, and I mean that in the most medical, least poetic way possible.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have something better: your grandmother's thimble you thought you lost. I found it behind the radiator and had it made into a ring because I know you believe in recycling luck. It's imperfect\u2014slightly dented, worn smooth by her fingers then yours. Like us. Like the life I'm proposing.\n\nLeyi, you impossible, necessary thing: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you, but because love isn't about deserving? Because the universe made you from the same carbon that makes diamonds and pencil lead, and somehow you chose to be the thing that writes rather than the thing that cuts? Because saying yes would be the most unreasonable, unearned, unsustainable decision you could make, and therefore the only one that makes sense?\n\nI am not a finished person. I am a collection of attempts. But every attempt, from now until my last breath, is yours if you want it.\n\nWaiting, shaking, certain\u2014\nWarren\n\nP.S. I wrote this in one sitting.

I hoard these imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I haven't invented you from the wishbone of my loneliness.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning at my parents' house\u2014you were green, genuinely green, heaving into their heirloom vase\u2014my mother said later, \"She's not very sturdy, is she?\" And I thought: No, she's not. She's breakable and strange and apologizes to furniture and I would burn down the world to keep her safe. That's when I knew this wasn't love anymore. It was something more dangerous. It was recognition. Like finding my own kidney in another person's body.\n\nYou're afraid you're not enough. Leyi, \"enough\" is a word invented by people who've never watched you try to save dead houseplants with CPR. Who've never seen you leave voice messages for your grandmother who died three years ago because you can't bear to delete her number. You're not enough\u2014you're too much. You're excessive. You're what happens when the universe forgets to be careful.\n\nI've started to understand religion because of you. Not God\u2014that's too simple. But the holy terror of being chosen by something you don't deserve. Every night you choose to sleep beside me feels like a bureaucratic error in heaven that no one's caught yet. I wake up at 3 AM just to watch you breathe, to confirm the miracle is still happening, that they haven't recalled you for being incorrectly distributed to someone like me.\n\nDo you want to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's watching you eat cereal at midnight, milk dripping onto your constellation of a nightshirt, and thinking: I would die without this. Not metaphorically. Literally. My cells would forget their purpose. It's calculating the precise angle you tilt your head when you're about to cry and positioning myself to catch you. It's the violence of ordinary Tuesday afternoons when you're just reading and I have to leave the room because the sight of you existing makes my chest cavity feel too small.\n\nThat Thursday when my father called me a disappointment again\u2014thirty-four years old and still his favorite failure\u2014you didn't say I wasn't. You said, \"Good. Disappoint him more. Disappoint everyone who wanted you small.\" Then you made me instant ramen, the cheap kind, and added an egg exactly the way sadness tastes better. How did you know that was the antidote? How do you always know which version of me needs which version of you?\n\nHere's my confession: I've already married you in every way that matters. In the quantum mechanics of my intention. In the cellular democracy where every atom voted yes. In the future that's already happened where we're old and you still can't whistle and I still love the trying. The ceremony, the paper, the ring\u2014that's just paperwork for a merger that's already complete.\n\nBut I want the paperwork. I want the evidence. I want to be arrested with proof of you. I want strangers to know that you, inexplicably, chose me. That Leyi Chen, who keeps fortunes from fortune cookies sorted by year, who practices arguments with houseplants, who still leaves one bite of everything \"for the angels\"\u2014that this impossible person looked at me, Warren Zhang, professional disappointment and amateur human, and said: him, I choose him.\n\nSo here it is, the violence of truth: Marry me. Not because I love you\u2014love is too small a word for this catastrophe. Marry me because I've already died and been resurrected by you so many times that my death certificate is basically fiction. Marry me because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014is a paradox that makes physics uncomfortable. Marry me because I bought your grandmother's thimble from your aunt and had it made into a ring, and if you don't wear it, I'll have to explain to a thimble why it's not enough.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. We're already terminal with each other. This is just asking permission to name the disease.\n\nI am yours in the way that rivers are the ocean's\u2014inevitably, gravitationally, without other options.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's ordinary. You've made me unfit for any life but the one where you can't whistle and I love the trying.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. It's not 4:47 AM. It's whatever time you're reading this, because that's the only time that exists now\u2014the moment where you decide if this ordinary Tuesday becomes the anniversary of everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.7295.

It's 5:34 AM. I haven't slept. Can't sleep. Sleep is a country I can't find my passport to anymore.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I wasn't broken before you. That would be easier\u2014you fixing me, completing me, all those lies we tell about love. No. I was whole. Functioning. I had systems. Then you walked into my life carrying a dying succulent you'd named Fernando, asking strangers if they knew how to save it, and every system I'd built just... stopped. Like someone had pulled the plug on my careful ordinary life.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is ugly. Truth is that I've memorized the way you breathe when you're pretending to be asleep. Three shallow, one deep, repeat. Truth is I know you're lactose intolerant but you eat ice cream anyway and then curl into a question mark of regret. Truth is that last Tuesday when you said you were at your sister's, you were sitting in your car outside our apartment for two hours because you needed to be alone but still close to me. I saw you. I didn't say anything. Love is also knowing when to pretend you don't know things.\n\nThat night in the emergency room\u2014remember? You thought it was appendicitis but it was just anxiety wearing a different costume. The doctor said your body was eating itself from stress. You laughed. Said, \"At least something wants me from the inside.\" That's when I understood: you're not just carrying your own darkness. You're carrying your mother's disappointments, your father's unspoken grief, that terrible thing that happened when you were fourteen that you still won't name. And still, STILL, you make strangers smile on elevators.\n\nI need to tell you about the Thursday you'll never remember. You were drunk. Not cute drunk\u2014ugly drunk, saying things designed to make me leave. Testing how much acid I could swallow and still stay. You called me a coward wearing a brave man's face. Said I loved the idea of you, not the actual mess. Then you threw up on my favorite shoes and cried about climate change and the death of handwriting. I cleaned you up, put you to bed, and sat on the bathroom floor until dawn, thinking: This. This exact disaster. This is what I choose.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? Not losing you\u2014that's too simple. What terrifies me is that you'll stay but stop being you. That you'll sand down your edges to fit better in my hands. That you'll stop apologizing to furniture, stop crying at commercials for agricultural equipment, stop leaving voice messages for your dead grandmother's phone. I fell in love with your exact damage. Don't fix it for me.\n\nHere's what I'm not saying prettily: My body has reorganized itself around your existence. When you're gone, my left ventricle forgets its job. My kidneys process loneliness instead of waste. My skeleton becomes a question mark asking where you went. This isn't romance\u2014it's biology. You've become necessary to my physical functioning. Without you, I don't metaphorically die. I literally malfunction.\n\nRemember when you asked if I believed in fate? I lied. Said no. Truth: I believe in whatever cosmic accident put us in the same bookstore on the same Tuesday when you were buying a book about dying alone and I was returning one about living alone and we reached for the same pen to sign the credit card receipts. If that's not fate, then fate is just a word for the beautiful violence of statistics working in our favor.\n\nBut here's what haunts me at 3 AM when you're unconscious and perfect: In another version of this story, I'm braver sooner. I tell you on our third date instead of our three hundredth that you've ruined me for regular life. In another version, I don't waste so much time being scared of how much I need you. But maybe that's the point\u2014maybe we needed all that wasted time to compost into this moment where I can finally say:\n\nI don't want to marry you because I love you. I want to marry you because \"love\" is too small a word for this situation. What I feel is closer to gravitation\u2014a fundamental force I neither control nor understand but submit to completely. You're not my other half. You're the reason I realized I could be more than whole. You're the overflow. The too-much. The cup running over and making a mess of everything.\n\nYour mother thinks you're settling for me. She's right. You could have someone stable, successful, who doesn't alphabetize anxiety medications and rehearse phone calls. But you chose me\u2014the man who watches you sleep like it's a spectator sport, who has named the seven different ways you laugh, who would sell his organs in order of least necessity if you needed anything. That's not romantic. That's insane. But it's our specific insanity, and I want to make it legal.\n\nSo this is my proposal: Marry me. Not for the right reasons. For the real reasons. Because you can't whistle but keep trying. Because you eat sandwiches in a spiral from the outside in. Because when I have nightmares, you don't wake me\u2014you just match your breathing to mine until I find my way out. Because the alternative\u2014existing in parallel instead of together\u2014would be like voluntarily choosing color blindness.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's made from a fork from our first dinner when you laughed so hard you snorted wine through your nose and I thought: \"This. This is the soundtrack to the rest of my life.\" The jeweler thought I was insane. He was right. But it's our insanity, worn smooth by use, bent into a circle that means: no beginning, no ending, just the continuous fact of us.\n\nI could promise you forever, but forever is just time, and time is just something we made up to pretend we're not all temporary. Instead, I promise you this: tomorrow I will choose you. Actively. Consciously. Like picking the same song on repeat not because I've forgotten there are other songs, but because this is the only one I want to hear. And the next day, same choice. And the next. Until one of us stops choosing, stops breathing, stops being. And even then, whatever's left of me will keep choosing whatever's left of you.\n\nThis letter is too long. Too much. Too everything. Like you. Like us. Like the love that's reorganized my molecular structure into something that only makes sense in relation to you.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I'm already yours in ways that would require surgery to undo.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you asked if I think we're soulmates. I said I don't believe in souls. That was true. But I believe in whatever part of you recognizes the same part in me\u2014call it souls, call it atoms, call it the cosmic joke that made us both alive at the same time. Whatever it is, it's already said yes. The rest is just paperwork.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
