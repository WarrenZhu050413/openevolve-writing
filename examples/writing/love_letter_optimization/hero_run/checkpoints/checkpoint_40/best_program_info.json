    "evaluation_notes": "This letter approaches but doesn't quite reach the level of Johnny Cash's masterpiece (83). It shares Cash's directness and rejection of ornament but lacks his economy and spiritual depth. More successful than most contemporary attempts - would rank above Hemingway's letters to Hadley (69) but below Napoleon's urgent physicality (82).

However, it lacks the prosodic mastery of Beethoven's \"Immortal Beloved\" (86) or the tragic grandeur of Wilde's De Profundis period. The marriage proposal framework echoes Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville-West but without her linguistic precision. Overall score of 73 places it in the proto-masterful range - seeds of brilliance constrained by occasional self-indulgence and insufficient formal innovation."
