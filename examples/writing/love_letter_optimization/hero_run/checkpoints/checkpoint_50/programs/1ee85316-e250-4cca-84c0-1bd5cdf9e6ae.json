Haven't been able to since you asked for this letter. You want the truth? The truth is I'm terrified you'll see through me\u2014see that I'm just a person who got impossibly lucky and knows it.\n\nI've been cataloging moments. Not the big ones. The Tuesday you got hiccups during that work call and tried to hide them. The way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though you know it doesn't work. How you still check behind shower curtains for murderers. That Thursday you ugly-cried about a video of a dog reuniting with its owner and then got mad at me for not crying too.\n\nHere's what loving you actually is: It's me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you while you were at that conference. It's saving screenshots of your texts where you just say \"okay\" because even your mundane responses feel like evidence that you exist, that this is real. It's how I practice proposing in my car and always chicken out because what if you realize you could do better? You could. You absolutely could.\n\nI know you think you're difficult to love. You warned me about your anxiety, your overthinking, the way you need reassurance that you're not too much. But Leyi\u2014you're not too much. You're exactly enough. The precise amount. When you spiral at midnight about something you said wrong three years ago, when you make me check that you locked the door four times, when you get irrationally angry at inanimate objects that won't cooperate\u2014that's not despite loving you. That IS loving you.\n\nThe stupidest things destroy me now. Your hair tie on my bathroom counter. Your coffee mug in my sink. The dent in my couch cushion where you always sit. Last week I couldn't throw away a grocery receipt because you'd written \"tomatoes?\" on it and your handwriting felt sacred. This is insane. I know it's insane. I don't care.\n\nTruth: Before you, I had a five-year plan. Now I can't imagine five minutes ahead if you're not in them. You derailed everything and I'm grateful. You made me into someone who believes in magic because how else do I explain you choosing me? You chose ME. Still can't comprehend it.\n\nSometimes you look at me like I'm something wonderful and I want to stop time, bottle it, live in that look forever. Other times you look at me like I'm an idiot (usually warranted) and somehow I love that just as much. Maybe more.\n\nI don't have beautiful words. I'm not a poet. I'm just some guy who won the cosmic lottery and spends every day terrified the universe will realize its mistake. But here's what I know: I would rather be scared with you than safe with anyone else. I would rather argue with you about whether cereal is soup than have easy conversations with anyone else. I would rather watch you sleep-eat crackers at 3 AM than have romantic dinners with anyone else.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm worthy\u2014I'm not. But because I'm yours already. Completely. Pathetically. Irrevocably. Because I already plan my days around your smile. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption you'll be there. Because the thought of you reading this and saying no is the worst thing I can imagine, but the thought of not asking is worse.\n\nI love you. Not in a nice, clean, greeting-card way. In a messy, desperate, would-donate-all-my-organs-to-you-right-now way. In a this-is-probably-unhealthy-but-I-don't-want-to-be-healthy-if-it-means-loving-you-less way.\n\nPlease say yes. I already told my mom we're getting married. She bought a hat.\n\nYours (like, really, actually, legally yours if you'll let me),\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I know you're going to make fun of me for the hat thing. I'm counting on it. I love when you make fun of me.

Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies.

Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed.

Then you started existing in my life, and suddenly there were two kinds: the minutes that crawl when you're away, and the hours that vanish like startled birds when you're near.

Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

You asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel, how it rewrites the grammar of my days.\n\nBefore you, I understood love as metaphor\u2014hearts and flowers, promises carved in air. But you taught me love as syntax: how your laugh punctuates my mornings, how your silences speak louder than any vow. When you read, tucking that strand of hair behind your ear, I understand why ancient philosophers believed in the music of the spheres. You are my quantum entanglement\u2014changing me by existing, no matter the distance.\n\nI remember Tuesday, 3:47 AM, you sleeping beside me, the streetlight through blinds painting tiger stripes across your shoulder. I counted your breaths\u2014seventeen per minute\u2014and realized I was synchronizing mine to yours. This is what they don't tell you about love: it's not the grand gestures but the small surrenders. How I now buy two cups when getting coffee, even when alone. How every beautiful thing I see becomes a future conversation with you.\n\nYou know my faults\u2014my tendency to overthink, to build walls from books and irony. But with you, I am catastrophically sincere. You've made me brave enough to admit that I don't just love you; I believe in you the way others believe in gravity or God\u2014as fundamental force, as answered prayer, as the thing that makes all other things make sense.\n\nThis letter is my map of scars and stars, my confession that you've ruined me for any life where you're not there, reading in bed while I write beside you, our feet touching under blankets, building our small forevers from Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise perfection, but because I promise presence\u2014to witness your becoming, to choose you in every parallel universe, to love you with the ferocity of someone who knows what it means to almost not exist, and chooses existence because it means existing with you.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6185, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. I've started this letter nineteen times. The crumpled pages around me are proof that truth is harder than poetry.\n\nHere's what I cannot say out loud: I am broken without you. Not poetically broken. Actually broken. Like last Tuesday when you went to visit your sister and I stood in our kitchen at 2 AM eating cereal from the box because making a bowl felt pointless if you weren't there to steal bites from it.\n\nI'm supposed to tell you how you complete me, but that's backwards. You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.\n\nDo you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.\n\nThat's disgusting. I know. But it's true.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.\n\nThis is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop. Because here's the worst part: I would rather scare you away with too much honesty than trick you into staying with too little.\n\nI need you to know - not think, not hope, but KNOW - that you are not my better half. You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.\n\nI will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.\n\nI am terrified you'll say no. I am more terrified of never asking.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this in the small hours before dawn, when the world is quiet enough that I can hear my own heartbeat - the same heartbeat that quickens whenever you enter a room, that steadies when you take my hand, that has learned to keep time with yours.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday in the rain? You were laughing at something I'd said - I can't even recall what - and a drop of water hung from your eyelash like a tiny crystal. In that moment, I understood what eternity meant. Not endless time, but time abolished. Every Tuesday since has been an echo of that one perfect instant when I knew, with absolute certainty, that I had been walking through my life asleep until you woke me.\n\nI love how you fold paper napkins into perfect squares when you're thinking. How you hum Debussy in the shower but claim you don't know classical music. The way you pronounce \"library\" with that slight emphasis on the first syllable that you insist you don't do. I love your terrible handwriting and your perfect memory for conversations from years ago. I love that you cry at commercials about dogs but stay stoic through tragic films.\n\nBut more than these small treasures, I love who I become in your presence. You make me brave enough to be gentle, strong enough to be vulnerable. Before you, I was a rough draft of myself - all crossed-out lines and uncertain margins. You didn't edit me; you taught me that I was already a poem worth reading.\n\nIf I could give you anything, it would be to see yourself through my eyes for just one moment. You would never doubt again that you are the axis on which my world turns, the gravity that keeps me grounded, the north star by which I navigate every decision.\n\nI am not a poet, Leyi. I am just a man who has discovered that ordinary words become inadequate when trying to map the geography of a love like ours. So I offer you this promise instead: Every morning for the rest of my life, I will choose you again. In sickness, in health, in youth, in age, in this life and whatever comes after - I will find you, and I will choose you.\n\nMarry me, not because I cannot live without you (though this is true), but because I cannot imagine becoming who I'm meant to be without you beside me. You are not my better half - you are the mirror that shows me I am already whole, already worthy, already home.\n\nWith all my love, always,\nYour Warren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evaluation history and current metrics, I need to write a love letter that pushes beyond the current boundaries while maintaining absolute truthfulness.

Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since you asked for this letter. You want the truth? The truth is I'm terrified you'll see through me\u2014see that I'm just a person who got impossibly lucky and knows it.\n\nI've been cataloging moments. Not the big ones. The Tuesday you got hiccups during that work call and tried to hide them. The way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though you know it doesn't work. How you still check behind shower curtains for murderers. That Thursday you ugly-cried about a video of a dog reuniting with its owner and then got mad at me for not crying too.\n\nHere's what loving you actually is: It's me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you while you were at that conference. It's saving screenshots of your texts where you just say \"okay\" because even your mundane responses feel like evidence that you exist, that this is real. It's how I practice proposing in my car and always chicken out because what if you realize you could do better? You could. You absolutely could.\n\nI know you think you're difficult to love. You warned me about your anxiety, your overthinking, the way you need reassurance that you're not too much. But Leyi\u2014you're not too much. You're exactly enough. The precise amount. When you spiral at midnight about something you said wrong three years ago, when you make me check that you locked the door four times, when you get irrationally angry at inanimate objects that won't cooperate\u2014that's not despite loving you. That IS loving you.\n\nThe stupidest things destroy me now. Your hair tie on my bathroom counter. Your coffee mug in my sink. The dent in my couch cushion where you always sit. Last week I couldn't throw away a grocery receipt because you'd written \"tomatoes?\" on it and your handwriting felt sacred. This is insane. I know it's insane. I don't care.\n\nTruth: Before you, I had a five-year plan. Now I can't imagine five minutes ahead if you're not in them. You derailed everything and I'm grateful. You made me into someone who believes in magic because how else do I explain you choosing me? You chose ME. Still can't comprehend it.\n\nSometimes you look at me like I'm something wonderful and I want to stop time, bottle it, live in that look forever. Other times you look at me like I'm an idiot (usually warranted) and somehow I love that just as much. Maybe more.\n\nI don't have beautiful words. I'm not a poet. I'm just some guy who won the cosmic lottery and spends every day terrified the universe will realize its mistake. But here's what I know: I would rather be scared with you than safe with anyone else. I would rather argue with you about whether cereal is soup than have easy conversations with anyone else. I would rather watch you sleep-eat crackers at 3 AM than have romantic dinners with anyone else.\n\nMarry me. Not because I'm worthy\u2014I'm not. But because I'm yours already. Completely. Pathetically. Irrevocably. Because I already plan my days around your smile. Because I've already built my entire future on the assumption you'll be there. Because the thought of you reading this and saying no is the worst thing I can imagine, but the thought of not asking is worse.\n\nI love you. Not in a nice, clean, greeting-card way. In a messy, desperate, would-donate-all-my-organs-to-you-right-now way. In a this-is-probably-unhealthy-but-I-don't-want-to-be-healthy-if-it-means-loving-you-less way.\n\nPlease say yes. I already told my mom we're getting married. She bought a hat.\n\nYours (like, really, actually, legally yours if you'll let me),\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I know you're going to make fun of me for the hat thing. I'm counting on it. I love when you make fun of me. Please do it forever.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
