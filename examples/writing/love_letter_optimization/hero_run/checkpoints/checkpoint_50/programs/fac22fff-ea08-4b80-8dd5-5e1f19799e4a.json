Each word costs me something\u2014a held breath, a skipped heartbeat, a small death. It's 3:19 AM. The walls of this room know your name better than they know mine.\n\nListen: I was born twice. Once, screaming into fluorescent hospital light\u2014a date they put on forms. The second time was quieter: the moment you looked at me over that broken umbrella in the rain and said, \"Well, we're already wet.\" That's when I actually began.\n\nBefore you, I was a competent ghost. I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code.

You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see.

How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you.

You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness.

Each word costs me something\u2014a held breath, a skipped heartbeat, a small death. It's 3:19 AM. The walls of this room know your name better than they know mine.\n\nListen: I was born twice. Once, screaming into fluorescent hospital light\u2014a date they put on forms. The second time was quieter: the moment you looked at me over that broken umbrella in the rain and said, \"Well, we're already wet.\" That's when I actually began.\n\nBefore you, I was a competent ghost. I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code. This is just what truth looks like when it's pretending to be words.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
