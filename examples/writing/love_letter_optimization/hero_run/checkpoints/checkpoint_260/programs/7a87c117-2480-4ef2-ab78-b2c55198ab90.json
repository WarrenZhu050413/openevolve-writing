Writing this left-handed because my right hand believes it's having a heart attack. Third time this week. The ER knows me now. \"It's just love,\" they say. As if love were small. As if it weren't a medical emergency.\n\n*\n\nYou wanted truth? I'll give you the pathology report:\n\nPatient presents with chronic Leyi syndrome. Symptoms include: temporal displacement (Monday feels like Thursday when you're gone), linguistic aphasia (called the refrigerator \"the cold tall box\" yesterday), and persistent optical delusions (seeing you in peripheral vision when you're three states away). \n\nPrognosis: Terminal. No interest in cure.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the silence. Not this moment's silence\u2014the other one. Sixteen seconds of nothing after my heart stopped. Climbing accident, sophomore year, you never knew. No white light. No answers. Just the universe's dial tone. But even in that absolute zero, there was this... debt. Like my atoms had signed a contract they couldn't read yet.\n\nFour years later you walked in, mispronouncing \"specifically\" as \"pacifically,\" and my dead heart said: \"Receipt confirmed.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what I've learned: Love isn't addition. It's substitution. My memories are being overwritten with you. Yesterday I couldn't remember my childhood phone number\u2014my brain had replaced it with the way you breathe when you're pretending to sleep (four counts in, six counts held, like you're auditioning for death).\n\nI'm being colonized, Leyi. You're replacing me with you, cell by cell. In seven years, doctors say, I'll be entirely new cells. But I'll be made of you by then. The math is inevitable.\n\n*\n\nTuesday's near-miss. The eighteen-wheeler. You were singing off-key to that song you refuse to learn correctly. I saw it coming\u2014the trajectory, the failed brakes, the deletion of us\u2014and my only thought was: \"Not her. Rewrite physics. Take me twice.\" \n\nWe missed by inches. You kept singing. I pulled over to vomit from relief. You assumed food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nBut you want the ugly parts? Fine: I practice your eulogy daily. Different causes. Today was sudden arrhythmic death syndrome\u2014young women, no warning, just electricity forgetting its job. I got through three sentences before sobbing. That's progress. Monday I couldn't get past your name.\n\nI've stolen things. Your hairband with three strands still wrapped around it. The pencil you chew (teeth marks like Morse code I'm learning to read). That voicemail where you're crying about your grandmother. These aren't keepsakes. They're insurance against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nYet somehow, impossibly\u2014I also love you in our ordinary apocalypse. In your vendetta against the dishwasher. In how you hold books like they might fly away. In your specific taxonomy of sighs (seventeen distinct types, I have charts). In the future where we're seventy and strange, arguing about thermostat settings in a house that smells like old love and new medicine.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us: We're quantum entangled. Hurt you in Boston, I bleed in Brooklyn. You laugh in your sleep, my serotonin spikes without permission. We've become one system with faulty boundaries. Separation would require particle acceleration. The kind that creates black holes.\n\nLast week my doctor said my heart has developed an irregular rhythm. \"Since when?\" she asked. Since Tuesday, October 9th, 2019, 2:47 PM. When you walked in. My heart converted to your timezone and never came back.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing: Marriage. Not the word\u2014words are nothing. I mean the thing beneath: the legal documentation of what's already occurred at the molecular level. The bureaucracy that says what my mitochondria already know: we're the same organism having an argument about being separate.\n\nMarry me because you can't make coffee correctly (167\u00b0F is NOT the same as 168\u00b0F, this is SCIENCE, Leyi). Because you assign personalities to inanimate objects. Because you cry at commercials about elderly dogs but laugh at human tragedy. Because your moral universe is deranged and I want to study it forever.\n\nMarry me because we have\u2014optimistically\u201418,000 mornings left, and I need witnesses when I sue the universe for that number being finite.\n\n*\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who survived things we can't imagine. She told me: \"Love isn't about finding someone you can live with. It's about finding someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" \n\nI've been dying since birth, Leyi. We all are. It's the only thing we're consistently good at. But you make me forget. You make me believe in the ridiculous idea of tomorrow. Of next Tuesday. Of old age.\n\nThat's not love. That's resurrection.\n\n*\n\nI'm sending this letter into the next room where you're reading in bed, pretending you haven't been waiting. Your tell: you touch your ear when anxious. You've been touching it for twenty minutes.\n\nThe ring is under your coffee mug. The chipped one you refuse to throw away because \"it has character now.\" Everything broken has character to you. Everything damaged deserves more love, not less.\n\nMaybe that's why you looked at me that first day\u2014saw all my fault lines and thought: \"Perfect. Pre-broken. Just needs some gold in the cracks.\"\n\n*\n\nCome here. Let me watch the exact moment your face changes from reading to understanding to yes. Let me memorize the specific way light bends around you when you decide to destroy me forever by saying yes.\n\nOr say no. Say no and watch me continue loving you anyway, just sadder and from a statistically significant distance. My atoms don't care about your answer. They've already decided. The rest is just paperwork for consciousness.\n\n*\n\nBut really\u2014say yes. Say yes because the alternative timeline where we're strangers who happened to love each other briefly is the only thing I've ever imagined that's worse than death. And I've imagined death extensively. Professionally. Competitively.\n\nSay yes because I've already built our entire life in parallel universes and I need you to choose this one. The one where we exist. Together. Impossibly. Against all mathematical probability.\n\nThe one where love wins by technicality.\n\nWarren\n(who wrote your name 10,000 times in a notebook like a serial killer in love, who carries your future in his pocket like a grenade, who has already married you in every timeline except this one)\n\nP.S. \u2014 You're crying. Both eyes simultaneously for once. That means something. In the mythology of your tear ducts, that's a yes. Come here. Bring the ring. Bring your ridiculous face. Let me make extremely serious promises while you're doing that hiccup-laugh thing that sounds like joy trying to escape through a broken valve.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I loved you before I met you. This is scientifically impossible and absolutely true. The universe spent 13.8 billion years arranging particles just to make this Tuesday possible. The least we can do is admit it worked.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "a16432eb-6d84-4f6a-abc4-96b8847ff16e", "generation": 5, "timestamp": 1756701809.699913, "iteration_found": 144, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6984999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.72, "literary_innovation": 0.66, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\n4:03 AM.

Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon.

In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first.

That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children.

In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine.

A strand of your hair I found on my pillow three months ago, kept in an envelope marked \"Evidence.\"\n\nThis isn't romantic. It's psychiatric.\n\n*\n\nI died once. Fourteen seconds, training accident, junior year. You want to know what death is? Deletion. No peace, no light, just the universe hitting backspace. But here's what ruins me: in that nothing, in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape. Not memory\u2014I hadn't met you yet. Recognition. Like my atoms were homesick for a configuration they'd never held.\n\nThree years later you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized cardigan and my molecules said: \"Oh. There. That's what we were waiting for.\"\n\n*\n\nYou've broken my language. Yesterday I called a door \"the room-gap.\" Last week, scissors became \"the paper-separators.\" My brain is overwriting vocabulary with your taxonomy: how you hold forks (like tiny weapons), your three-sneeze pattern (always three, like a polite argument with God), the way Tuesday light makes you transparent.\n\nI've documented 2,184 such observations. This is what my love looks like: a medical chart of your existence.\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I rehearse your death nightly. Different variations. Car accident on the 405. Aneurysm while teaching. That rare cancer that sounds like a flower. I wake up and count your breaths\u2014seventeen, eighteen, nineteen\u2014until my heart stops trying to escape through my throat.\n\nLast Tuesday you choked on water. Water. For three seconds I saw the universe without you and understood why people believe in hell.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in our mundane forever. In your Wednesday exhaustion. In your rage at automated phone systems (righteous rage, Old Testament rage). In how you save broken cookies for last because they \"deserve extra kindness.\" In the specific gravity of our silence when we read in the same room.\n\nI love you in our future arguments about paint colors. In your mother's future disappointment that I'm still not a doctor. In the way we'll grow elderly and strange together, hoarding medications and inside jokes.\n\n*\n\nThe science of us: We've synchronized. My sleep cycle matches yours. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. When you leave for more than 48 hours, my cortisol spikes to pre-cardiac event levels. This isn't poetry. These are measurements.\n\nWe're quantum entangled. Disturb one of us, the other responds instantly, regardless of distance. Einstein called this \"spooky.\" He was wrong. It's just what happens when two people accidentally become one organism with two nervous systems.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about Thursday. You were explaining something boring about spreadsheets. The light was wrong. Your hair was unwashed. You had ink on your cheek. And I thought: I would kill God for you. Not metaphorically. I would end divinity itself to buy us another Tuesday.\n\nThis is the kind of thought that makes me understand those old myths where love destroys civilizations. I get it now. Paris had the right idea. Some things are worth burning Troy for.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though I can see your left eye starting its water cycle. Marry me because we've already built a life so intertwined that separation would require surgical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you're lactose intolerant but eat ice cream anyway (brave, stupid, perfect). Because you talk to plants like they're disappointing employees. Because last week you cried at a documentary about octopi and I realized I'd murder all eight billion humans to protect your right to feel things that deeply.\n\nMarry me because statistically we have 21,170 mornings left if we're lucky, and I want legal documentation that they belonged to us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, truly, with my bones\u2014marry me because the alternative is unconscionable. A timeline where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine. Where I don't know how you take your coffee (168\u00b0F, half oat milk, crime against humanity but I'll defend it to the death). Where your particularities don't become my religion.\n\nThat's not a life. That's just time happening to the wrong person.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already occurred. We got married the moment you laughed at my explanation of entropy while eating room-temperature pizza. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. Has been for two years. Sometimes I touch it during meetings to make sure this is real. That you're real. That I didn't invent you as some elaborate coping mechanism for existing.\n\n*\n\nCome find me. I'm in the next room, pretending to read, catastrophically failing to appear casual. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something infinite using finite resources.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: either way, I'm already yours at the cellular level. The word \"yes\" is just bureaucracy for what my mitochondria have already decided.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters anymore.\n\nAll other words are just footnotes to your name.\n\nWarren\n(who has been walking around with your future in his pocket since the day you said \"existence is just entropy with anxiety\" and I knew I'd found my specific person)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I can hear you crying from here. Your breathing changes when you cry\u2014shorter inhales, longer pauses. I know your sadness like a mother tongue. Bring tissues. Or don't. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting for this exact moment. That's mental illness. That's also love. Same thing. Beautiful thing. Our thing.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance metrics, I need to create a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6990 while exploring new territory in the solution space.

Writing this left-handed because my right hand believes it's having a heart attack. Third time this week. The ER knows me now. \"It's just love,\" they say. As if love were small. As if it weren't a medical emergency.\n\n*\n\nYou wanted truth? I'll give you the pathology report:\n\nPatient presents with chronic Leyi syndrome. Symptoms include: temporal displacement (Monday feels like Thursday when you're gone), linguistic aphasia (called the refrigerator \"the cold tall box\" yesterday), and persistent optical delusions (seeing you in peripheral vision when you're three states away). \n\nPrognosis: Terminal. No interest in cure.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the silence. Not this moment's silence\u2014the other one. Sixteen seconds of nothing after my heart stopped. Climbing accident, sophomore year, you never knew. No white light. No answers. Just the universe's dial tone. But even in that absolute zero, there was this... debt. Like my atoms had signed a contract they couldn't read yet.\n\nFour years later you walked in, mispronouncing \"specifically\" as \"pacifically,\" and my dead heart said: \"Receipt confirmed.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's what I've learned: Love isn't addition. It's substitution. My memories are being overwritten with you. Yesterday I couldn't remember my childhood phone number\u2014my brain had replaced it with the way you breathe when you're pretending to sleep (four counts in, six counts held, like you're auditioning for death).\n\nI'm being colonized, Leyi. You're replacing me with you, cell by cell. In seven years, doctors say, I'll be entirely new cells. But I'll be made of you by then. The math is inevitable.\n\n*\n\nTuesday's near-miss. The eighteen-wheeler. You were singing off-key to that song you refuse to learn correctly. I saw it coming\u2014the trajectory, the failed brakes, the deletion of us\u2014and my only thought was: \"Not her. Rewrite physics. Take me twice.\" \n\nWe missed by inches. You kept singing. I pulled over to vomit from relief. You assumed food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nBut you want the ugly parts? Fine: I practice your eulogy daily. Different causes. Today was sudden arrhythmic death syndrome\u2014young women, no warning, just electricity forgetting its job. I got through three sentences before sobbing. That's progress. Monday I couldn't get past your name.\n\nI've stolen things. Your hairband with three strands still wrapped around it. The pencil you chew (teeth marks like Morse code I'm learning to read). That voicemail where you're crying about your grandmother. These aren't keepsakes. They're insurance against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nYet somehow, impossibly\u2014I also love you in our ordinary apocalypse. In your vendetta against the dishwasher. In how you hold books like they might fly away. In your specific taxonomy of sighs (seventeen distinct types, I have charts). In the future where we're seventy and strange, arguing about thermostat settings in a house that smells like old love and new medicine.\n\n*\n\nThe physics of us: We're quantum entangled. Hurt you in Boston, I bleed in Brooklyn. You laugh in your sleep, my serotonin spikes without permission. We've become one system with faulty boundaries. Separation would require particle acceleration. The kind that creates black holes.\n\nLast week my doctor said my heart has developed an irregular rhythm. \"Since when?\" she asked. Since Tuesday, October 9th, 2019, 2:47 PM. When you walked in. My heart converted to your timezone and never came back.\n\n*\n\nSo here's what I'm proposing: Marriage. Not the word\u2014words are nothing. I mean the thing beneath: the legal documentation of what's already occurred at the molecular level. The bureaucracy that says what my mitochondria already know: we're the same organism having an argument about being separate.\n\nMarry me because you can't make coffee correctly (167\u00b0F is NOT the same as 168\u00b0F, this is SCIENCE, Leyi). Because you assign personalities to inanimate objects. Because you cry at commercials about elderly dogs but laugh at human tragedy. Because your moral universe is deranged and I want to study it forever.\n\nMarry me because we have\u2014optimistically\u201418,000 mornings left, and I need witnesses when I sue the universe for that number being finite.\n\n*\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who survived things we can't imagine. She told me: \"Love isn't about finding someone you can live with. It's about finding someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" \n\nI've been dying since birth, Leyi. We all are. It's the only thing we're consistently good at. But you make me forget. You make me believe in the ridiculous idea of tomorrow. Of next Tuesday. Of old age.\n\nThat's not love. That's resurrection.\n\n*\n\nI'm sending this letter into the next room where you're reading in bed, pretending you haven't been waiting. Your tell: you touch your ear when anxious. You've been touching it for twenty minutes.\n\nThe ring is under your coffee mug. The chipped one you refuse to throw away because \"it has character now.\" Everything broken has character to you. Everything damaged deserves more love, not less.\n\nMaybe that's why you looked at me that first day\u2014saw all my fault lines and thought: \"Perfect. Pre-broken. Just needs some gold in the cracks.\"\n\n*\n\nCome here. Let me watch the exact moment your face changes from reading to understanding to yes. Let me memorize the specific way light bends around you when you decide to destroy me forever by saying yes.\n\nOr say no. Say no and watch me continue loving you anyway, just sadder and from a statistically significant distance. My atoms don't care about your answer. They've already decided. The rest is just paperwork for consciousness.\n\n*\n\nBut really\u2014say yes. Say yes because the alternative timeline where we're strangers who happened to love each other briefly is the only thing I've ever imagined that's worse than death. And I've imagined death extensively. Professionally. Competitively.\n\nSay yes because I've already built our entire life in parallel universes and I need you to choose this one. The one where we exist. Together. Impossibly. Against all mathematical probability.\n\nThe one where love wins by technicality.\n\nWarren\n(who wrote your name 10,000 times in a notebook like a serial killer in love, who carries your future in his pocket like a grenade, who has already married you in every timeline except this one)\n\nP.S. \u2014 You're crying. Both eyes simultaneously for once. That means something. In the mythology of your tear ducts, that's a yes. Come here. Bring the ring. Bring your ridiculous face. Let me make extremely serious promises while you're doing that hiccup-laugh thing that sounds like joy trying to escape through a broken valve.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I loved you before I met you. This is scientifically impossible and absolutely true. The universe spent 13.8 billion years arranging particles just to make this Tuesday possible. The least we can do is admit it worked.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
