My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork.

It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3.

Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The dishwasher just stopped clicking. Even it knows this is the moment. Everything knows. The kitchen tiles. The expired milk you refuse to throw away. That spider in the corner we've named Senator Legs. They're all waiting for your answer. No pressure, but the structural integrity of the universe depends on what you say next.\n\nP.P.S. I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie). Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed. This is who you're marrying: a man who prepares for hypothetical futures with actual paperwork. God help you. God help us both.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7440)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:52 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: High-Performer)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6215, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:17 AM. Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since Tuesday when you said you needed this letter.\n\nThe truth? I don't know how to write this. I've started nineteen times. This is the twentieth. My hands are shaking and I keep deleting sentences because they sound like someone trying to sound like they're in love instead of just... being in love.\n\nSo here's what's true:\n\nWhen I was seven, my grandfather died. I remember asking my mother why she was crying so much, and she said: \"When you love someone for a long time, they become part of your body. When they leave, it's not grief\u2014it's phantom limb syndrome.\" I didn't understand then. I do now. You're already in my nervous system. If you left, I'd keep reaching for you. Muscle memory doesn't forget.\n\nI'm scared of almost everything. Seriously. Scared of cancer, car accidents, plane crashes, food poisoning, identity theft, climate change, brain aneurysms. But mostly I'm scared that one morning I'll wake up and you'll be sixty-three and I'll be sixty-five and we'll have spent our whole lives being careful instead of being honest. So here's honest:\n\nI talk to you when you're not here. Full conversations. Both sides. You usually win the arguments.\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and have to leave the room because the feeling is too big. It's like trying to hold the ocean in my chest. I go to the bathroom and sit on the floor and just breathe until I can come back to bed without waking you up with how much I love you.\n\nI know this sounds crazy but: I loved you before we met. There's no other explanation for why I saved that empty seat next to me for twenty-nine years. Not consciously. But every woman I dated, I was comparing to someone who didn't exist yet. Then you walked in and my body said: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nThe worst part about loving you? It made me ordinary. I used to think I was special, complicated, interesting. Then you happened and suddenly I'm just another person destroyed by love, saying the same things everyone says: \"I can't live without you.\" \"You complete me.\" \"You're everything.\" These clich\u00e9s used to make me laugh. Now they make me cry because I understand why millions of people couldn't find better words. There aren't any.\n\nBut also the small things: You eat pizza with a fork. You cry at commercials with dogs. You think 2+2=5 when you're tired. You hum when you're nervous. You can't sleep without your left foot outside the blanket. You pretend you don't like my terrible puns but you smile\u2014just a little\u2014before you groan.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for seven months. Not because I was waiting for the perfect moment but because I was scared you'd realize you could do better. You can, by the way. Do better. But please don't.\n\nHere's what I promise: I'll love you wrong. I'll love you too much. I'll embarrass us at parties with how I look at you. I'll forget important dates but remember that you hate wool sweaters. I'll mess up. Daily. But I'll show up. Also daily.\n\nI can't promise you the moon or stars or whatever people promise. But I can promise this: When you can't sleep, I'll tell you boring stories about my day until you drift off. When you're sad, I'll make terrible jokes until you laugh despite yourself. When you're happy, I'll be happy just watching you be happy. When we're old, I'll still see you exactly as you are right now, Tuesday afternoon, reading this letter with your coffee getting cold.\n\nMarry me. Not because of this letter. Marry me because you already know my answer when you ask \"what do you want for dinner?\" (Whatever you want.) Marry me because we've been practicing being married for three years. Marry me because the other day you referred to my mother as \"mom\" without thinking about it and she cried.\n\nMarry me because I can't write poetry but I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve you anyway.\n\nLeyi, I don't have beautiful words. I just have this: \n\nYou're my person. The one I want to tell everything to. The one I want next to me when the test results come back. The one I want to argue with about thermostats and loading the dishwasher correctly. The one I want to watch get old.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Either way, I'm already yours.\n\nBut say yes.\n\nPlease.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.7010, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM because sleep is a country I can no longer visit without you as my passport.

It's me at the grocery store, paralyzed in the cereal aisle because I'm calculating how many breakfasts we have left if we're lucky. 23,360. I've counted. That's if we make it to eighty. I want to sue the universe for this number.\n\nYou want truth? I practice your death in my dreams. Every night. Different versions. Car accidents, diseases with Latin names, sudden disappearances where you simply vanish like a quantum particle nobody was observing. I wake up and check your breathing. Count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three\u2014there. There you are. Still real. Still impossible.\n\nI loved you before I met you. This sounds insane. It is insane. But on March 15th, 2019, three years before we met, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body.\" That was you. You were already changing me before you existed in my life. How do you explain that to physics?\n\nListen. I'm bad at this. I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then discover I'm just a collection of anxieties wearing a human suit. That I check if you're breathing seventeen times a night. That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion). You know that when you had the flu, I googled \"how to transfer illness from one person to another\" because I wanted to take it from you.\n\nHere's my proposal: Marry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is a lie we tell because the truth is unbearable. Marry me for the next twenty-four hours. Then let's renew it tomorrow. And the next day. Let's make a thousand small marriages, each one a choice, each one a revolution against the dying of light.\n\nMarry me because I'm selfish. Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code. I have hands that know the exact temperature you like your coffee (167 degrees Fahrenheit). I have a mouth that's terrible at speeches but excellent at saying your name like it's the only prayer I remember.\n\nLeyi. That's it. That's the whole truth.\n\nLeyi.\n\nSay yes anyway.\n\nWarren\n(still shaking)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with your pen\u2014the one you chew when thinking. Teeth marks on the cap. I taste them sometimes when you're not home. This is the kind of thing that would disgust me about anyone else.\n\nTruth: I've been rehearsing your death since our second date. When you ordered dessert, I thought: she believes in the future. I wanted to warn you about me then. How I catalog exits. How I love like the house is already on fire.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I still have the receipt from our first coffee. $8.47. I've done the math\u2014if I frame it, the UV damage will fade the ink completely in 94 years. I'll be dead by then, but someone will find it: a blank rectangle that once proved we began. This keeps me awake.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: Yesterday, I couldn't remember my mother's maiden name for three seconds. My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5\u00b0F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.\n\nI bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're already wearing it. You can't help yourself with surprises. Your tell is that you touch your hair when hiding something. You're doing it now. I'm watching through the crack in the door like a creep who loves you. Come here. Let me see it on you. Let me see the rest of my life on your finger.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm"]}}}
