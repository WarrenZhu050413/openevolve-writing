The concrete is cold through my socks. I came out here to get the screwdriver but ended up sitting on the floor with this legal pad I stole from work, trying to explain something that breaks every time I touch it with words.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's the point.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "ce02f720-a2ec-40b5-a2fb-dbb546474192", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756701981.350283, "iteration_found": 0, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.7354999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.77, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the garage at 3:31 AM.
