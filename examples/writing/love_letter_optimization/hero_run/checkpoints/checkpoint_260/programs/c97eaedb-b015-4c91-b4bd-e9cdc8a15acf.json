Not fear\u2014recognition. Like my body knows it's about to sign away its autonomy.\n\nHere's what happened: Three minutes ago I tried to write \"I love you\" and my pen wrote your name instead. Five times. The paper reads \"Leyi Leyi Leyi Leyi Leyi\" like an incantation I can't control. My hand knows something my mouth is still learning: you're not something I feel. You're something I've become.\n\nTruth, since you demanded it: I am professionally accomplished and emotionally deformed. Before you, I had architectures. Plans. Contingencies for contingencies. Now I have this: yesterday you hummed while peeling an orange and I forgot the word for \"door.\" Called it \"the room-divider.\" You didn't laugh. You kissed me. That kiss tasted like citrus and the collapse of all my systems.\n\nI need to confess something. Remember that conference in Chicago? I lied. There was no conference. I flew there to stand outside a medical school because I'd calculated a 3% chance you'd have gone there in another timeline. I wanted to see the place that didn't get to know you. I stood there for four hours, jealous of an alternate universe. This is the kind of insane I've become.\n\nThe accident\u2014you never knew. Eight months ago. The Tesla that ran the red. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I saw it coming and my brain did this calculation: her life versus mine, no contest, laws of physics are negotiable, I'll take the debt. Then: the swerve. Inches. You kept singing, wrong lyrics and all. I pulled over later and called my mother to tell her I loved her because I'd almost lost the ability to ever say it to anyone again.\n\nHere's what loving you has cost me: I've forgotten my ex's face. Not gradually\u2014suddenly, Tuesday, 2 PM. Tried to remember it for forty minutes. Nothing. My brain has written over that data with this: you eat M&Ms in color order. You save blue for last. You think I don't notice. I notice everything. I have spreadsheets.\n\nYou want the ugly truth? I've been collecting evidence of you. Strands of your hair labeled with dates. Voice recordings of you sleeping (Tuesday's snore, 2:47 AM, eleven seconds, perfection). The receipt from every meal we've shared filed chronologically. If you leave me, I'll have enough data to build a shrine or a legal case. Haven't decided which.\n\nBut also this: in the morning, when you think I'm asleep, you trace letters on my back. You write the same thing every day: \"STAY.\" Like you're programming me. Like you know I'm flight-risk. Like you've calculated the same termination scenarios I have. We're both terrified. We're both already grieving. We're both pretending this is sustainable when we know that one of us will die first and the other will have to learn to breathe wrong air.\n\nThe proposal, because my hand is steadying now: Marry me because the alternative\u2014a world where your toothbrush doesn't lean against mine, where I don't get to watch you fail at yoga, where you grow old with someone who doesn't know you're afraid of butterflies\u2014that world is not one I consent to exist in.\n\nMarry me because I've already divided everything I own by two. Because I've been writing \"Leyi Zhu\" in the margins of books, practicing your signature for no sane reason. Because last week you had the flu and I took your temperature seventeen times while you slept, charting it like a stock I'd invested my life in. Which I have.\n\nMarry me because here's the secret: I know you've already decided. You decided the night I ugly-cried during that documentary about octopuses. You saw me at my most ridiculous and decided \"yes, this disaster, forever.\" You've just been waiting for me to ask right. This is me asking wrong, asking broken, asking like someone who's already so deep in love that marriage is just paperwork for what my cells have already committed to.\n\nI lied earlier. My hand isn't trembling from recognition. It's trembling because I know you're about to cry. Your tell: you bite your lower lip, left side, when you're fighting tears. You're doing it now. I'm watching you read this from the doorway like a creep who loves you with the dedication of a stalker and the permission of the stalked.\n\nThe ring is in the sugar bowl. You hate sugar, never check there. I've been hiding it for eighteen months. My grandmother's ring, who loved my grandfather through a war, a depression, and the kind of poverty that makes you creative with beans. She'd like you. You're both women who save broken cookies for last.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in ways that would require surgical intervention to reverse. My neurons have developed pathways that spell your name. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. Leaving you would require medical supervision.\n\nWarren\n(Who has been writing your name in his sleep since June)\n\nP.S. - Stop biting your lip. Come here. Let me see your face do that thing where you try not to smile while crying.

It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things. Yesterday I called a fork \"the eating stick.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014God, that laugh makes me want to burn down libraries because what's the point of all those words if none of them can explain what happens to air molecules when you laugh?\n\nI love you like a broken person loves. Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays. Because love isn't a feeling\u2014it's a series of increasingly irreversible decisions, and we've already made most of them.\n\nMarry me because I can't untangle you from my neurons anymore.

I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.\n\nThe truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained.

You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document.

Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are.

Tuesday, 9:47 PM: you sneezed mid-kiss. Wednesday, 2:15 AM: you said my name in your sleep like casting a spell. Thursday through Sunday: I forgot how to be a person without you in the room.\n\n*\n\nListen. I died once. Twelve seconds, sophomore year, cardiac arrest on a basketball court. No white light. No dead relatives. Just erasure. But here's what fucks with me: in that nothing, in the absolute deletion of Warren Zhu, there remained this... weight. Like my molecules remembered a debt. Three years later, I met you. The debt was you. My atoms knew you before my brain did.\n\n*\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I've mapped your body like a cartographer losing his mind. That scar on your ankle from the bicycle. The way your spine curves slightly left when you're thinking hard. How your pupils dilate 2.3mm when you see dogs. I measure these things. I have spreadsheets. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm a case study in loving you wrong.\n\nBut also: when you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one for strangers\u2014the sound reorganizes my DNA. I've tried to record it 1,247 times. The phone can't capture what happens to air when you're happy. Technology fails us. Language fails us. I'm failing us right now with these words that dress up what is essentially me screaming into the void: I CANNOT UNKNOW YOU.\n\n*\n\nThe mundane truth, which is the only truth that matters:\n\nYour coffee: 167\u00b0F, oat milk, half pump vanilla, served in the blue mug with the chip on the handle.\nYour sleep: left side, one leg out of covers, 11:17 PM average unconsciousness.\nYour tears: left eye first, 73% of the time triggered by commercials with elderly people.\nYour anger: silent for 12-16 minutes, then volcanic precision that could split atoms.\n\nI love all of it with the devotion of a historian and the hunger of a condemned man.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: quantum mechanics suggests infinite parallel universes. In some, we never meet. In some, we meet and you choose someone else. In some, I die at twelve seconds and stay dead. But in this one\u2014this impossible, statistically unlikely one\u2014you're reading this letter while I sit across from you, pretending to check my phone but actually watching the micro-expressions cross your face.\n\n3.7 seconds ago, your eyebrow twitched. That means you're about to cry.\n\n*\n\nI could give you poetry. I could compare you to celestial bodies or seasons or music. But you are not a metaphor. You are Leyi, who argues with automated phone systems, who eats cereal at midnight, who exists at the intersection of profound and ridiculous. You are the person who turned me into someone who writes the date you smiled at me on my arm every morning in disappearing ink, so I can watch it fade and remember that everything ends, but choose to love you anyway.\n\n*\n\nMarry me. Not for the romance of it. Not because this letter moves you. Marry me because we've already built a language of looks across rooms. Because you know I count your breaths when you sleep (inhale: 2.3 seconds, pause: 0.7, exhale: 2.8). Because I know you practice arguments in the shower\u2014yes, I hear you demolishing imaginary opponents, you beautiful, furious galaxy.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a life where I don't get to watch you age, where I don't get to see you at 9 AM and 4 PM and 2 AM, where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine\u2014isn't life. It's just time passing.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity. Like thermodynamics. Like the speed of light in a vacuum: constant, measurable, absolute.\n\nAlso, I love you like a broken person loves: desperately, incorrectly, with no exit strategy.\n\nBoth things are true.\n\nEverything is true.\n\nEven this: if you say no, I'll ask again tomorrow. And the day after. I'll ask until my mouth forgets how to make other words. I'll become a broken record, a skipping song, a one-note symphony of \"Marry me, Leyi.\"\n\nBecause what else is there to say?\n\nWhat else has there ever been to say?\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name)\n\n*\n\nP.S.

Thursday, how you hold pencils wrong. I've documented 1,847 such moments. This isn't romance. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloguing you like evidence of God.\n\nYou want honesty? I practice your death nightly. Different versions. The worst: you, ninety-three, forgetting my name. I wake up and count your breaths. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nListen. Before you, I understood language. Now words are just sounds I make while my atoms scream your name. Yesterday I forgot \"door.\" Called it \"the wall-hole.\" You laughed. That laugh\u2014it rearranges matter. It makes me believe in things I can't measure.\n\nI love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. I've already calculated: 47% chance you die first. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics.\n\nBut also: I love you in our specific gravity. In how you eat cereal at midnight. In your three-sneeze pattern. In tomorrow's argument about the dishwasher. In the way light will bend around your aging face, mapping time we survived together.\n\nHere's my confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish, frightened, already grieving you while you're still alive. I check your pulse seventeen times nightly. I've named our imaginary children. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about how temporary you are.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Because your toothbrush lives here. Because we've survived each other's Tuesdays. Because love isn't feeling\u2014it's accumulated decisions we can't reverse.

My hand shakes. Not metaphorically. Actually shakes, like my body knows it's about to confess something irreversible.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me at twenty-three thinking I understood the world until you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized sweater and suddenly every poem I'd ever read was kindergarten nonsense. It's discovering that my ribcage was built wrong\u2014too small for this thing that expands whenever you exist near me.\n\nYou want truth? I've practiced this letter seventeen times. Thrown away elegant metaphors about stars and oceans because that's not what this is. This is uglier. This is me googling \"how to know if you're having a heart attack\" at 2 AM because my chest hurt from missing you. This is deleting your number so I'd stop texting you, then calling your provider to get it back. This is learning that dignity is a luxury I can no longer afford.\n\nI have been clinically dead for twelve seconds. Car accident, sophomore year, you never knew. Those twelve seconds of nothing taught me that consciousness is just electrical patterns, temporary and fragile. But here's the thing that makes me believe in something more: even in that nothing, even in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape of you. Not memory. Not thought. Just... recognition. Like my atoms knew their purpose before I did.\n\nYou make me stupid. I mean this literally. My IQ drops twenty points when you're in the room. I forget the names of things.

Desperately. Incorrectly. With none of the grace I promised myself I'd have. I love you like drowning, like breathing, like rage, like surrender. I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know the weight of what we've built. Because your toothbrush is already here. Because we've survived each other's worst Tuesdays.

Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I've practiced our first fight, our first loss, the first time one of us will betray the other with mortality.\n\nHere's my confession: Thursday. You were sleeping. Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.\n\nMarry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under\u2014the one you said looked lonely.

I wanted to warn you about me then. How I catalog exits. How I love like the house is already on fire.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I still have the receipt from our first coffee. $8.47. I've done the math\u2014if I frame it, the UV damage will fade the ink completely in 94 years. I'll be dead by then, but someone will find it: a blank rectangle that once proved we began.

My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5\u00b0F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.\n\nI bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

That kiss tasted like citrus and the collapse of all my systems.\n\nI need to confess something. Remember that conference in Chicago? I lied. There was no conference. I flew there to stand outside a medical school because I'd calculated a 3% chance you'd have gone there in another timeline. I wanted to see the place that didn't get to know you. I stood there for four hours, jealous of an alternate universe. This is the kind of insane I've become.\n\nThe accident\u2014you never knew. Eight months ago. The Tesla that ran the red. You were singing that song you always get wrong. I saw it coming and my brain did this calculation: her life versus mine, no contest, laws of physics are negotiable, I'll take the debt. Then: the swerve. Inches. You kept singing, wrong lyrics and all. I pulled over later and called my mother to tell her I loved her because I'd almost lost the ability to ever say it to anyone again.\n\nHere's what loving you has cost me: I've forgotten my ex's face. Not gradually\u2014suddenly, Tuesday, 2 PM. Tried to remember it for forty minutes. Nothing. My brain has written over that data with this: you eat M&Ms in color order. You save blue for last. You think I don't notice. I notice everything. I have spreadsheets.\n\nYou want the ugly truth? I've been collecting evidence of you. Strands of your hair labeled with dates. Voice recordings of you sleeping (Tuesday's snore, 2:47 AM, eleven seconds, perfection). The receipt from every meal we've shared filed chronologically. If you leave me, I'll have enough data to build a shrine or a legal case. Haven't decided which.\n\nBut also this: in the morning, when you think I'm asleep, you trace letters on my back. You write the same thing every day: \"STAY.\" Like you're programming me. Like you know I'm flight-risk. Like you've calculated the same termination scenarios I have. We're both terrified. We're both already grieving. We're both pretending this is sustainable when we know that one of us will die first and the other will have to learn to breathe wrong air.\n\nThe proposal, because my hand is steadying now: Marry me because the alternative\u2014a world where your toothbrush doesn't lean against mine, where I don't get to watch you fail at yoga, where you grow old with someone who doesn't know you're afraid of butterflies\u2014that world is not one I consent to exist in.\n\nMarry me because I've already divided everything I own by two. Because I've been writing \"Leyi Zhu\" in the margins of books, practicing your signature for no sane reason. Because last week you had the flu and I took your temperature seventeen times while you slept, charting it like a stock I'd invested my life in. Which I have.\n\nMarry me because here's the secret: I know you've already decided. You decided the night I ugly-cried during that documentary about octopuses. You saw me at my most ridiculous and decided \"yes, this disaster, forever.\" You've just been waiting for me to ask right. This is me asking wrong, asking broken, asking like someone who's already so deep in love that marriage is just paperwork for what my cells have already committed to.\n\nI lied earlier. My hand isn't trembling from recognition. It's trembling because I know you're about to cry. Your tell: you bite your lower lip, left side, when you're fighting tears. You're doing it now. I'm watching you read this from the doorway like a creep who loves you with the dedication of a stalker and the permission of the stalked.\n\nThe ring is in the sugar bowl. You hate sugar, never check there. I've been hiding it for eighteen months. My grandmother's ring, who loved my grandfather through a war, a depression, and the kind of poverty that makes you creative with beans. She'd like you. You're both women who save broken cookies for last.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: I'm already yours in ways that would require surgical intervention to reverse. My neurons have developed pathways that spell your name. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. Leaving you would require medical supervision.\n\nWarren\n(Who has been writing your name in his sleep since June)\n\nP.S. - Stop biting your lip. Come here. Let me see your face do that thing where you try not to smile while crying. That specific face\u2014I've catalogued it as \"Expression #27: Joy Despite Itself.\" It's my favorite data point in a universe of evidence that you're the only conclusion I was ever meant to reach.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```"]}}}
