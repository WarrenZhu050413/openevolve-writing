Sitting on the closed toilet lid because the tiles are too cold and you'd hear me if I sat on the bedroom floor. I've been carrying this ring for 127 days. I know the exact number because I have a spreadsheet. Cell A1 says \"Day 1: Bought ring, threw up in jeweler's parking lot.\" Cell A127 says \"Still a coward.\"\n\nYou want truth? I've been documenting you like evidence for a crime I'm committing. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Videos of you sleep-talking about grocery lists. A database\u2014yes, an actual database\u2014tracking your moods against barometric pressure because I thought there was a pattern. There is. You're sadder when it rains, except Thursdays. I don't know why Thursdays are immune. I've run seventeen statistical models.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I measure your breathing. Fourteen breaths per minute sleeping. Twenty-three when anxious. Eleven that night after your father called\u2014so slow I kept checking your pulse. I have a notebook where I write down every time you mispronounce a word. Current count: 47. \"Specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when angry. \"Library\" as \"liberry\" when tired. I will never correct you. I will take these mispronunciations to my grave. They're mine now.\n\nLast Tuesday, 2:34 PM, you were peeling a tangerine in the kitchen. Just standing there, back to me, dropping peels into the sink. Juice on your fingers. The smell filled the room and I had to leave because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience. I sat in my car and googled \"can you die from loving someone too much.\" WebMD says no but WebMD is wrong. I'm dying, Leyi. Cell by cell. And each dead cell is replaced by one that only knows how to want you.\n\nYou don't know this but I've assigned numbers to your laughs. Type 1: Polite, for strangers. Type 2: Real but contained. Type 3: The snort-laugh you're embarrassed by. Type 4: Silent shoulder-shaking when something's so funny you can't breathe. Type 5: The one that's just for me, usually at 2 AM when I say something stupid. I live for Type 5. I would commit felonies for Type 5.\n\nThree months ago you reorganized my kitchen drawers. Moved the utensils. Mixed the forks with spoons like some kind of anarchist. My first thought wasn't annoyance. It was \"she's planning to stay.\" I haven't moved them back. I never will. I want archaeologists to find our bones and be confused by our chaotic silverware choices.\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, quantifiable, pathological truth\u2014is that I've been testing myself. Seeing how long I can go without looking at your pictures. Record: 47 minutes. Failed during a work presentation. My colleague asked why I was crying. I said allergies. I'm not allergic to anything except the thought of you choosing someone else.\n\nI need you to understand: I was complete before you. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder\" (14.7 PSI on average, increases to 18.2 when you're excited). I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: seconds until I see you, seconds since I saw you. There is no present tense, only the echo and anticipation of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're asleep twenty feet away. Diagonal distance through the wall: 23.7 feet, I measured. You have no idea I'm in here, writing draft thirty-one of this letter while sitting on a toilet, crying quietly enough not to wake you. In twelve minutes your alarm will go off. You'll hit snooze twice. At 4:43 AM you'll actually get up, shuffle to the bathroom, find me here surrounded by crumpled paper, and ask what the hell I'm doing.\n\nAnd I'll hand you this letter. This confession. This evidence of my complete psychological collapse. Because you wanted truth and the truth is I'm not proposing\u2014I'm plea bargaining. I'm already guilty of loving you past the point of sanity. The ring is just a formality. The wedding is just paperwork. In my mind, we've been married since that Thursday you fixed my collar and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for exactly 31 minutes. I know because I checked my phone log. Missed four calls. Didn't care.\n\nSo here's my truth, Leyi: I would rather choke on this confession than pretend for one more day that I'm normal about you. I'm not normal about you. I'm clinical about you. I have spreadsheets about you. I've calculated that I think about you every 11.3 seconds on average. That's 7,646 times per day. I've named our unborn children in seventeen different combinations. I practice your signature with my last name. I practice my signature with your last name. I practice a hyphenated version just to cover all bases.\n\nPlease. Marry me. Not the theoretical better version of me but this actual disaster who counts your breaths, who catalogs your laughs, who would rather die than delete even one of the 2,341 photos, who's been sitting on this toilet for twenty-seven minutes now and can't feel his left foot but won't move because he's terrified of losing the courage to give you this letter.\n\nYour alarm's about to go off. You're about to find me. My entire future depends on the next ninety seconds.\n\nI love you like a fever of 103.7 degrees. I measured.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will take me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you pretend to hate math but you do sudoku in pen when you think I'm not looking. I have 73 photos of you concentrating on number puzzles. Your nose wrinkles in the same spot every time. Grid reference: 1.3cm left of center. This is the kind of man you're considering marrying. A man who measures your nose wrinkles. Please consider it anyway.

A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did.

Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence.

Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi. Words fail but I'm trying anyway.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will have me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder.

The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.\n\nI've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already yours. Have been since that Tuesday when you laughed at my quantum physics joke and the universe cracked open and reorganized itself around the sound.\n\nYours in this reality and all parallel dimensions,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped.

You're asleep upstairs, one leg kicked free of the blankets, making that small sound that isn't quite a snore but I'd testify in court that it is. I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains.

I've been documenting you without consent. 1,849 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining the plot of movies to the dog. A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle so I know when to have chocolate in the house. Column A: Date. Column B: Mood (1-10 scale). Column C: Chocolate type that worked. This isn't romantic. This is evidence of obsession. But you said truthful, not healthy.\n\nI need to tell you about the lists. Hidden in my phone, encrypted, because I'm a coward: \"Times Leyi's laugh made strangers turn around\" (147). \"Words Leyi mispronounces that I'll never correct\" (currently 23, 'specifically' is number one). \"Seconds I've spent watching Leyi sleep\" (492,360 and counting). \"Things I've googled about love being a medical condition\" (too many to count, cleared my history twice).\n\nLast Tuesday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just standing there, dropping peel pieces into the sink, juice on your fingers, and I had to leave the room because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience about citrus. This is what you've done\u2014you've made me feel God in fruit peeling. You've made me understand why people used to die from loving too much. It was real. It was cardiac. I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness. I could walk past drug stores without checking if they had your specific brand of lip balm (Burt's Bees, pomegranate, you go through one every six weeks). I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Not because you might leave\u2014though that thought makes my stomach drop\u2014but because you might stay. Because you see through my deflections and my overthinking and somehow you're still here, leaving your books on my nightstand, stealing my socks, teaching me that love isn't about being understood but about being known. Fully known, and still chosen.\n\nSo here's my truth, undecorated: I love you with the desperate gratitude of someone who never expected to be loved back. I love you like a fact, like gravity, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise and I'll wake up wanting to tell you about my dreams. \n\nMarry me.

I've been documenting you like evidence for a crime I'm committing. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Videos of you sleep-talking about grocery lists. A database\u2014yes, an actual database\u2014tracking your moods against barometric pressure because I thought there was a pattern. There is. You're sadder when it rains, except Thursdays. I don't know why Thursdays are immune. I've run seventeen statistical models.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I measure your breathing. Fourteen breaths per minute sleeping. Twenty-three when anxious. Eleven that night after your father called\u2014so slow I kept checking your pulse. I have a notebook where I write down every time you mispronounce a word. Current count: 47. \"Specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when angry. \"Library\" as \"liberry\" when tired. I will never correct you. I will take these mispronunciations to my grave. They're mine now.\n\nLast Tuesday, 2:34 PM, you were peeling a tangerine in the kitchen. Just standing there, back to me, dropping peels into the sink. Juice on your fingers. The smell filled the room and I had to leave because I was having what I can only describe as a religious experience. I sat in my car and googled \"can you die from loving someone too much.\" WebMD says no but WebMD is wrong. I'm dying, Leyi. Cell by cell. And each dead cell is replaced by one that only knows how to want you.\n\nYou don't know this but I've assigned numbers to your laughs. Type 1: Polite, for strangers. Type 2: Real but contained. Type 3: The snort-laugh you're embarrassed by. Type 4: Silent shoulder-shaking when something's so funny you can't breathe. Type 5: The one that's just for me, usually at 2 AM when I say something stupid. I live for Type 5. I would commit felonies for Type 5.\n\nThree months ago you reorganized my kitchen drawers. Moved the utensils. Mixed the forks with spoons like some kind of anarchist. My first thought wasn't annoyance. It was \"she's planning to stay.\" I haven't moved them back. I never will. I want archaeologists to find our bones and be confused by our chaotic silverware choices.\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, quantifiable, pathological truth\u2014is that I've been testing myself. Seeing how long I can go without looking at your pictures. Record: 47 minutes. Failed during a work presentation. My colleague asked why I was crying. I said allergies. I'm not allergic to anything except the thought of you choosing someone else.\n\nI need you to understand: I was complete before you. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder\" (14.7 PSI on average, increases to 18.2 when you're excited). I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: seconds until I see you, seconds since I saw you. There is no present tense, only the echo and anticipation of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're asleep twenty feet away. Diagonal distance through the wall: 23.7 feet, I measured. You have no idea I'm in here, writing draft thirty-one of this letter while sitting on a toilet, crying quietly enough not to wake you. In twelve minutes your alarm will go off. You'll hit snooze twice. At 4:43 AM you'll actually get up, shuffle to the bathroom, find me here surrounded by crumpled paper, and ask what the hell I'm doing.\n\nAnd I'll hand you this letter. This confession. This evidence of my complete psychological collapse. Because you wanted truth and the truth is I'm not proposing\u2014I'm plea bargaining. I'm already guilty of loving you past the point of sanity. The ring is just a formality. The wedding is just paperwork. In my mind, we've been married since that Thursday you fixed my collar and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for exactly 31 minutes. I know because I checked my phone log. Missed four calls. Didn't care.\n\nSo here's my truth, Leyi: I would rather choke on this confession than pretend for one more day that I'm normal about you. I'm not normal about you. I'm clinical about you. I have spreadsheets about you. I've calculated that I think about you every 11.3 seconds on average. That's 7,646 times per day. I've named our unborn children in seventeen different combinations. I practice your signature with my last name. I practice my signature with your last name. I practice a hyphenated version just to cover all bases.\n\nPlease. Marry me. Not the theoretical better version of me but this actual disaster who counts your breaths, who catalogs your laughs, who would rather die than delete even one of the 2,341 photos, who's been sitting on this toilet for twenty-seven minutes now and can't feel his left foot but won't move because he's terrified of losing the courage to give you this letter.\n\nYour alarm's about to go off. You're about to find me. My entire future depends on the next ninety seconds.\n\nI love you like a fever of 103.7 degrees. I measured.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will take me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you pretend to hate math but you do sudoku in pen when you think I'm not looking. I have 73 photos of you concentrating on number puzzles. Your nose wrinkles in the same spot every time. Grid reference: 1.3cm left of center. This is the kind of man you're considering marrying. A man who measures your nose wrinkles. Please consider it anyway. Please.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
