Not metaphor. Actual tremor. My body knows I'm about to confess something that will reorganize both our futures.\n\n*\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been saving you in pieces. Your voicemail from February 9th where you're furious about parking\u2014I've listened to it 117 times. The receipt from our first coffee, laminated, hidden in my wallet like a suicide note in reverse. A strand of your hair I found on my pillow three months ago, kept in an envelope marked \"Evidence.\"\n\nThis isn't romantic. It's psychiatric.\n\n*\n\nI died once. Fourteen seconds, training accident, junior year. You want to know what death is? Deletion. No peace, no light, just the universe hitting backspace. But here's what ruins me: in that nothing, in the absolute absence of me, there was still this shape. Not memory\u2014I hadn't met you yet. Recognition. Like my atoms were homesick for a configuration they'd never held.\n\nThree years later you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized cardigan and my molecules said: \"Oh. There. That's what we were waiting for.\"\n\n*\n\nYou've broken my language. Yesterday I called a door \"the room-gap.\" Last week, scissors became \"the paper-separators.\" My brain is overwriting vocabulary with your taxonomy: how you hold forks (like tiny weapons), your three-sneeze pattern (always three, like a polite argument with God), the way Tuesday light makes you transparent.\n\nI've documented 2,184 such observations. This is what my love looks like: a medical chart of your existence.\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I rehearse your death nightly. Different variations. Car accident on the 405. Aneurysm while teaching. That rare cancer that sounds like a flower. I wake up and count your breaths\u2014seventeen, eighteen, nineteen\u2014until my heart stops trying to escape through my throat.\n\nLast Tuesday you choked on water. Water. For three seconds I saw the universe without you and understood why people believe in hell.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in our mundane forever. In your Wednesday exhaustion. In your rage at automated phone systems (righteous rage, Old Testament rage). In how you save broken cookies for last because they \"deserve extra kindness.\" In the specific gravity of our silence when we read in the same room.\n\nI love you in our future arguments about paint colors. In your mother's future disappointment that I'm still not a doctor. In the way we'll grow elderly and strange together, hoarding medications and inside jokes.\n\n*\n\nThe science of us: We've synchronized. My sleep cycle matches yours. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. When you leave for more than 48 hours, my cortisol spikes to pre-cardiac event levels. This isn't poetry. These are measurements.\n\nWe're quantum entangled. Disturb one of us, the other responds instantly, regardless of distance. Einstein called this \"spooky.\" He was wrong. It's just what happens when two people accidentally become one organism with two nervous systems.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about Thursday. You were explaining something boring about spreadsheets. The light was wrong. Your hair was unwashed. You had ink on your cheek. And I thought: I would kill God for you. Not metaphorically. I would end divinity itself to buy us another Tuesday.\n\nThis is the kind of thought that makes me understand those old myths where love destroys civilizations. I get it now. Paris had the right idea. Some things are worth burning Troy for.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though I can see your left eye starting its water cycle. Marry me because we've already built a life so intertwined that separation would require surgical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you're lactose intolerant but eat ice cream anyway (brave, stupid, perfect). Because you talk to plants like they're disappointing employees. Because last week you cried at a documentary about octopi and I realized I'd murder all eight billion humans to protect your right to feel things that deeply.\n\nMarry me because statistically we have 21,170 mornings left if we're lucky, and I want legal documentation that they belonged to us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, truly, with my bones\u2014marry me because the alternative is unconscionable. A timeline where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine. Where I don't know how you take your coffee (168\u00b0F, half oat milk, crime against humanity but I'll defend it to the death). Where your particularities don't become my religion.\n\nThat's not a life. That's just time happening to the wrong person.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already occurred. We got married the moment you laughed at my explanation of entropy while eating room-temperature pizza. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. Has been for two years. Sometimes I touch it during meetings to make sure this is real. That you're real. That I didn't invent you as some elaborate coping mechanism for existing.\n\n*\n\nCome find me. I'm in the next room, pretending to read, catastrophically failing to appear casual. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something infinite using finite resources.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: either way, I'm already yours at the cellular level. The word \"yes\" is just bureaucracy for what my mitochondria have already decided.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters anymore.\n\nAll other words are just footnotes to your name.\n\nWarren\n(who has been walking around with your future in his pocket since the day you said \"existence is just entropy with anxiety\" and I knew I'd found my specific person)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I can hear you crying from here. Your breathing changes when you cry\u2014shorter inhales, longer pauses. I know your sadness like a mother tongue. Bring tissues. Or don't. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting for this exact moment. That's mental illness. That's also love. Same thing. Beautiful thing.

My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I love you past the point of poetry into something more primitive\u2014cellular recognition, evolutionary imperative, the same force that makes birds migrate without maps.\n\nBut also: I love you in the Tuesday mornings. In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first. Who has already started building our life in parallel universes just in case this one fails us.\n\nMarry me.

My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition.

Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning.

You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

With someone doing something ordinary until someone else can't breathe from watching.\n\nYou want truth? I've been dead before. Literally. Eleven seconds, cardiac arrest, training accident. Here's what death taught me: nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just black. No tunnel, no light, no peace. But when I came back, my first thought was your name. Not relief. Not fear. Just \"Leyi.\" Like my neurons were arguing with death itself: you can have the rest but not this. Not her name.\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM because I just realized something terrible. I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.\n\nThe truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I've practiced our first fight, our first loss, the first time one of us will betray the other with mortality.\n\nHere's my confession: Thursday. You were sleeping. Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.\n\nMarry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under\u2014the one you said looked lonely.

A strand of hair caught on your lip. The universe split. In one version, I reached out to move it. In this version, I didn't. Both versions died of love.\n\n2. The hospital, your appendix surgery: They let me hold your hand during prep. You said, \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Then, softer: \"Just kidding. Leave everything. Let them know I was human.\" That's when I knew I'd marry you.\n\n3. Yesterday: You parallel parked perfectly while singing off-key Radiohead. I thought: This is how civilization ends. Not with bombs but with me, in a Honda Civic, suddenly understanding infinity.\n\n*\n\nThings I cannot say with my mouth but can write:\n\nSometimes I wake up and count the bones in your hand to make sure you're real. Twenty-seven. Always twenty-seven. The relief makes me nauseous.\n\nI've already written your eulogy. Also mine. In both, I lie about how we met. The truth is too ordinary: Tuesday, coffee shop, you complained about Wi-Fi. But ordinary is the holiest word I know now.\n\nWhen you cry, your left eye starts first. Always. I've built my entire religion around this fact.\n\n*\n\nThe physicist's proposal:\n\nConsider two particles, entangled. Separate them by galaxies. Disturb one\u2014the other responds instantly. This violates everything. Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance.\" He was wrong about the spooky part. It's just love. The universe is built on it. We're not metaphors for physics; physics is a metaphor for us.\n\n*\n\nWhat terrifies me: Not death. Tuesday, April 10th, 2089. You'll die first (statistically). I've already forgiven you for this. What terrifies me is Wednesday, April 11th, 2089. Then Thursday. Then the heat death of the universe, which will happen faster than those Wednesdays.\n\n*\n\nHere's the legal part: Marry me for tax purposes. For hospital visitation rights. For the banality of shared dental insurance. Marry me for the DMV forms. For the mortgage applications. For the school emergency contact lists. For every stupid document that demands we declare ourselves in binary terms: single or taken. Let me check \"taken\" with the cosmic permanence of a black hole's event horizon.\n\n*\n\nBut also marry me for this:\n\nBecause I've memorized the GPS coordinates of every place you've laughed (37 locations and counting). Because I know you're afraid of butterflies but not moths (this makes no sense and perfect sense). Because when you sleep, you hold your breath for seven seconds every third minute, and I've learned to breathe in your rhythm so we're synchronized even unconscious.\n\nBecause \"I love you\" is insufficient. The sentence structure implies subject/verb/object. But you're not object. You're the verb itself. You're the loving. The state change. The quantum leap between what I was and what I am.\n\n*\n\nFinal inventory:\n- One ring (hidden in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about)\n- This letter (draft #\u221e)\n- A heart that beats in iambic pentameter when you're near\n- The rest of my Wednesdays\n- All my dark matter\n- Everything after the decimal point\n\n*\n\nThe beginning, which is also the end: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. We got married the moment you laughed at my stupid joke about entropy. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nBut if you need the ritual:\n\nWill you marry me retroactively? Will you make honest what we've already been living?

Like my atoms were homesick for a configuration they'd never held.\n\nThree years later you walked in wearing that ridiculous oversized cardigan and my molecules said: \"Oh. There. That's what we were waiting for.\"\n\n*\n\nYou've broken my language. Yesterday I called a door \"the room-gap.\" Last week, scissors became \"the paper-separators.\" My brain is overwriting vocabulary with your taxonomy: how you hold forks (like tiny weapons), your three-sneeze pattern (always three, like a polite argument with God), the way Tuesday light makes you transparent.\n\nI've documented 2,184 such observations. This is what my love looks like: a medical chart of your existence.\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I rehearse your death nightly. Different variations. Car accident on the 405. Aneurysm while teaching. That rare cancer that sounds like a flower. I wake up and count your breaths\u2014seventeen, eighteen, nineteen\u2014until my heart stops trying to escape through my throat.\n\nLast Tuesday you choked on water. Water. For three seconds I saw the universe without you and understood why people believe in hell.\n\n*\n\nBut listen: I also love you in our mundane forever. In your Wednesday exhaustion. In your rage at automated phone systems (righteous rage, Old Testament rage). In how you save broken cookies for last because they \"deserve extra kindness.\" In the specific gravity of our silence when we read in the same room.\n\nI love you in our future arguments about paint colors. In your mother's future disappointment that I'm still not a doctor. In the way we'll grow elderly and strange together, hoarding medications and inside jokes.\n\n*\n\nThe science of us: We've synchronized. My sleep cycle matches yours. My immune system recognizes your bacteria as friendly. When you leave for more than 48 hours, my cortisol spikes to pre-cardiac event levels. This isn't poetry. These are measurements.\n\nWe're quantum entangled. Disturb one of us, the other responds instantly, regardless of distance. Einstein called this \"spooky.\" He was wrong. It's just what happens when two people accidentally become one organism with two nervous systems.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about Thursday. You were explaining something boring about spreadsheets. The light was wrong. Your hair was unwashed. You had ink on your cheek. And I thought: I would kill God for you. Not metaphorically. I would end divinity itself to buy us another Tuesday.\n\nThis is the kind of thought that makes me understand those old myths where love destroys civilizations. I get it now. Paris had the right idea. Some things are worth burning Troy for.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though I can see your left eye starting its water cycle. Marry me because we've already built a life so intertwined that separation would require surgical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know you're lactose intolerant but eat ice cream anyway (brave, stupid, perfect). Because you talk to plants like they're disappointing employees. Because last week you cried at a documentary about octopi and I realized I'd murder all eight billion humans to protect your right to feel things that deeply.\n\nMarry me because statistically we have 21,170 mornings left if we're lucky, and I want legal documentation that they belonged to us.\n\n*\n\nBut really, truly, with my bones\u2014marry me because the alternative is unconscionable. A timeline where your toothbrush doesn't live next to mine. Where I don't know how you take your coffee (168\u00b0F, half oat milk, crime against humanity but I'll defend it to the death). Where your particularities don't become my religion.\n\nThat's not a life. That's just time happening to the wrong person.\n\n*\n\nFinal confession: I'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already occurred. We got married the moment you laughed at my explanation of entropy while eating room-temperature pizza. The universe witnessed it. Everything since has been paperwork.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. Has been for two years. Sometimes I touch it during meetings to make sure this is real. That you're real. That I didn't invent you as some elaborate coping mechanism for existing.\n\n*\n\nCome find me. I'm in the next room, pretending to read, catastrophically failing to appear casual. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something infinite using finite resources.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: either way, I'm already yours at the cellular level. The word \"yes\" is just bureaucracy for what my mitochondria have already decided.\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters anymore.\n\nAll other words are just footnotes to your name.\n\nWarren\n(who has been walking around with your future in his pocket since the day you said \"existence is just entropy with anxiety\" and I knew I'd found my specific person)\n\nP.S. \u2014 I can hear you crying from here. Your breathing changes when you cry\u2014shorter inhales, longer pauses. I know your sadness like a mother tongue. Bring tissues. Or don't. I've been carrying them for three years, waiting for this exact moment. That's mental illness. That's also love. Same thing. Beautiful thing. Our thing.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
