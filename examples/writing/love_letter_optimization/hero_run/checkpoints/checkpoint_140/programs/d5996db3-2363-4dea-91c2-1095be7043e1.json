It's how you eat ice cream in winter because \"temperature is just a social construct,\" then steal my jacket anyway.

I could map the constellation of freckles on your left shoulder (Orion's belt, but better). I could confess that I've already planned our arguments twenty years from now, and how even in imagination, your angry face makes me want to kiss you until we forget what we were fighting about.\n\nInstead, I'll tell you this: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity, or the speed of light\u2014something fundamental that doesn't require belief to be true. I love you at the quantum level, where observation changes everything and nothing simultaneously.
