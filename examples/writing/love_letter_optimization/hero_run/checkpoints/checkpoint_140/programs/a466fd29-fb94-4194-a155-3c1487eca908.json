The dryer's been broken for six weeks but I keep coming here because it smells like the detergent you switched to without telling me. I've been sitting here for two hours trying to explain something that makes me sound like I need psychiatric intervention.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you like evidence. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining cryptocurrency to my mother (you were wrong about everything but she bought Dogecoin). A spreadsheet tracking your coffee temperature preferences across seasons\u2014you drink it 3.2 degrees cooler each month as you trust me more. Column A: Date. Column B: Temperature. Column C: Whether you noticed I'd already made it before you asked.\n\nHere's what I haven't told you: I practice your death. Every night. Different scenarios. Car accident: I catalog what I'd keep (everything, even your used dental floss). Cancer: I practice the eulogy where I explain you thought \"irregardless\" was a word. Heart attack: I plan my suicide down to the font on the note. This isn't romantic. This is what happens when someone reorganizes your brain chemistry without a permit.\n\nThat Tuesday when you found me sobbing in the garage? I'd just watched you fold a fitted sheet. First try. No YouTube. Just... folded it. Like you'd made a deal with geometry itself. I sat in my car for forty minutes afterward, googling \"can you die from loving someone too much?\" The answer is historically yes. Literally yes. People used to die from this. It was called consumption but really it was just this: watching someone fold impossible fabric and knowing you'd commit felonies for their mundane competence.\n\nYou should know what you're signing up for: I've assigned colors to your moods. Burnt orange when you're about to cry but won't. That specific green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, storing them in the freezer labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" I have recordings of you brushing your teeth\u2014the pattern never changes, upper left quadrant for exactly 11.2 seconds. I know you sleep-talk about pigeons needing lawyers. I know you think the plants are thriving but I replaced them with plastic six months ago and you water them every Thursday, telling them they're \"doing so good.\"\n\nThe truth underneath everything else: You've ruined me for normalcy. My baseline heart rate has increased by 16 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. I dream in your accent. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you mentioned liking it once in 2019. My coworker asked if I was okay and I wanted to scream: NO. I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER. ALL FOUR FINGERS. NO BREAKING.\n\nI bought the ring 241 days ago. I've swallowed it twice when you almost found it. Six hours in the ER. Told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse looked at me and said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your photo. She said, \"Oh honey, you're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nSometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my intervention, the way I'll explain to God that He made an error. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of practice grief. I hate you and I worship the specific frequency of your breathing and I promise things to a universe I'll fight if it tries to take you.\n\nListen. I know this letter is a psychiatric hold waiting to happen. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know normal people don't have spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's menstrual cycle to optimize chocolate availability. But I don't want normal. I want this spectacular disaster where you're the tsunami and the life raft and the reason I learned to swim.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that I've already rewired myself around your existence. My brain didn't ask permission. Every neuron ends with your name. When they autopsy me, they'll find your fingerprints on my hippocampus. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who writes love letters on laundry room floors at ungodly hours, crying into dirty concrete, grateful for the catastrophe of you.\n\nI can hear you waking up. Looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here and ask what the hell I'm doing. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it standing up because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus.\" And either you'll say yes or you'll call emergency services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed, rebuilt, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape keeps you close.\n\nThe ring tastes like copper and desperation. I know because I've had it in my mouth twice. This is who I am now. This is what loving you has done. It's made me into someone who'd eat jewelry for you. Who'd testify in court that your snoring is just \"breathing enthusiastically.\" Who'd burn down the world if it looked at you wrong.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. But know that I'm already gone. Have been since you laughed at my stupid joke and the universe glitched and suddenly nothing made sense except the specific way you cover your mouth when you're happy.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery, past the point of language, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will take me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. You just called my name. You're using the voice that means you know I'm being weird somewhere. In ten seconds you'll see me here on this floor with snot on my face and this letter that's basically evidence for commitment proceedings. You'll say \"what the fuck, Warren?\" And I'll know. I'll know by the way you say \"fuck\"\u2014rising inflection means yes, falling means you're calling your sister. Either way, I'm ready. I've been ready since you walked into my life and made me understand why people used to die from this feeling. Come find me. Come ruin me more.

I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out.

My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory.

It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is \"just dormant\"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.\n\nBut here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough.

I've checked.\n\nHere's the thing about loving you: it's like discovering I've been colorblind my whole life. Except instead of colors, it's everything. Food tastes different. Sleep feels different. My own name sounds foreign when anyone else says it. You've fundamentally altered my sensory processing, and I don't think it's reversible. I wouldn't want it reversed.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I had spreadsheets that weren't about your happiness.

I didn't know that love could feel like drowning and breathing for the first time simultaneously. Now I measure everything in relation to you: movies by whether you'd cry at them, restaurants by whether they have that wine you pretend not to love, time by how long until I see you again.\n\nYou know what terrifies me? You're in the next room right now, and you have no idea I'm out here losing my mind over how you hold pencils (between your middle and ring finger, like a beautiful lunatic). You don't know that I've already planned our entire life\u2014not the big things, the small ones. Where we'll keep the spare keys. What we'll name the plants. How I'll make your coffee every morning for the next 18,000 mornings, learning to adjust for seasonal preference changes (more milk in winter, less sugar in summer, I have charts).\n\nThe truth\u2014the ugly, desperate, pathological truth\u2014is that I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else. I would rather be your disaster than anyone else's masterpiece. I've already reorganized my entire existence around the assumption that you'll say yes, which is insane, because you could say no, and then what? I'll be this weird man with 1,849 photos and a chocolate spreadsheet and a heart that only beats correctly when you're within a fifty-foot radius.\n\nBut here's the thing, Leyi: I'm already ruined. You've already destroyed me in the best and worst way. When you leave a room, it becomes uninhabitable. When you laugh, I feel it in my molars. When you cry\u2014God, when you cry\u2014I understand murder. Not metaphorically. I understand the exact sequence of neurons that would make someone kill to stop another person's tears.\n\nSo I'm not really asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that in my head, in my heart, in whatever passes for my soul, we're already married. Have been since that Thursday when you fixed my collar before that meeting and your thumb brushed my neck and I forgot my own name for thirty-seven minutes. This proposal? This is just paperwork. This is just me asking the universe to catch up to what my cells already know.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm past eloquent. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper pennies and sounds like your name said 10,000 times into the dark. I'm at the place where I'd rather die choking on this confession than live one more day pretending I'm not catastrophically, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe garage door just creaked. You're looking for me. In ten seconds you'll find me here, on this cold floor, and you'll ask what the hell I'm doing at 3:31 AM. And I'll hand you this letter. And my entire life will pivot on what happens next.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already gone. Have been since the orange. Since the collar. Since that first specifically that you mispronounced and changed my understanding of perfection forever.\n\nYours in this dimension and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014you sleep-talked last night. You said \"Warren, the plants need water.\" Even unconscious, you're taking care of things. Even in dreams, you're worried about our plants. If that's not love, if that's not marriage already, then I don't understand anything anymore. Maybe I never did. Maybe that's the point.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Performs well on combined_score (0.7355), Performs well on phenomenological_authenticity (0.7700), Performs well on aesthetic_virtuosity (0.7100), Performs well on affective_force (0.7400), Performs well on literary_innovation (0.6800), Performs well on letter_text (Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the garage at 3:31 AM.

The engine's running because I'm cold but I can't come in yet because you don't know I've been sitting here since 4. This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man who documents his pathology in the margins of gas station receipts.\n\nYou want truth? I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days. I know because I made a spreadsheet. Column A: Date. Column B: Times I Almost Told You. Column C: Reasons I Didn't. Yesterday's entry: seven times, cowardice (subcategory: you were humming).\n\nHere's what loving you has done to me: I've started believing in God. Not metaphorically. Literally. Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi. Words fail but I'm trying anyway.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will have me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. Your coffee's in the cupholder.

Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete.

Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence.

I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Every failed relationship, every 3 AM loneliness, every time I caught myself practicing love on strangers\u2014I was rehearsing for you. Learning the grammar of devotion in a language I hadn't yet heard spoken.\n\nSecond: Yesterday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just peeling an orange. The light caught the spray of citrus oil and for seventeen seconds I forgot how to breathe. Not metaphorically. My lungs simply refused. My body understood before my brain did: this is it. This is the image I'll see when I'm dying. You, backlit, holding fruit like a promise.\n\nThird: I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not the pretty kind of scared\u2014the animal kind. The kind where your nervous system rewrites itself around another person's existence. I've started seeing the world in two categories: things that might hurt you (everything) and things that might make you smile (also everything, somehow). Do you understand what you've done? You've made me afraid of the universe and in love with it simultaneously.\n\nNow the fourth, the one that ruins me:\n\nWhen you sleep, you reach for me. Even unconscious, your body seeks mine across the dark geography of sheets. Your hand finds my ribs and rests there, right above my heart, like you're keeping it in place. Like you know it would follow you anywhere if you didn't hold it still. Last night I lay awake for three hours just feeling the weight of your palm, this unbearable specific pressure that I'll miss for the rest of my life even if you never leave.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you past language. Past the pathetic arithmetic of words like \"forever\" and \"always.\" I love you in the space between seconds. In the pause between heartbeats. In the quantum foam where particles appear and disappear and the universe can't decide what's real.\n\nYou asked for truth? The truth is I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every universe that matters. My cells have already taken your last name. My bones know the weight of your absence like gravity knows mass. When I make coffee in the morning, my hands automatically reach for two cups. When I hear something funny, my first thought isn't to laugh\u2014it's to tell you, to watch your face change, to catalog another shade of your joy.\n\nI know you're scared too. I see it in how you test me with small departures\u2014staying late at work, pulling away mid-kiss to see if I'll follow. I always will. Not because I'm desperate but because I've done the math: any universe where we're apart is a computational error. A glitch in the matrix. It simply doesn't process.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I was thinking that night on the roof? I said \"nothing\" because how could I explain that I was memorizing the specific frequency of your laugh? That I was calculating how many more times I'd get to hear it if we lived to ninety? That I was writing equations where X equals the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" and Y equals the end of my resistance to everything I thought I knew about myself?\n\nYou changed the physics of me. Not in some poetic way\u2014literally. My resting heart rate has increased by 13 beats per minute since meeting you. My sleep cycles have synced to yours. My body temperature runs 0.7 degrees warmer. I'm becoming you, cellularly, actually. Scientists would call it entrainment. I call it the only truth that matters.\n\nSo here I am, sitting in our bathroom at 4:47 AM because the bed feels wrong without you (you're in the kitchen, making tea, humming off-key). Here I am with this ring that weighs exactly 4.7 grams but feels like holding a star\u2014dense with possibility, burning my palm. Here I am, not asking you to marry me but telling you that we already are married in every way that counts. The ceremony is just paperwork for a merger that happened the moment you laughed at my terrible joke about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and I thought: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though Christ, I hope it does\u2014but because refusing would be like trying to unbake bread. Impossible. Already done. Written into the source code of what we've become.\n\nI'm going to stand up now. Walk to the kitchen. Give you this letter. Watch your face change as you read it. And then\u2014this is the beautiful, terrifying part\u2014you're going to say something, and my whole life is going to pivot on that sentence like a door on its hinge, swinging open or shut on the rest of existence.\n\nSay yes. Not for me. For the orange light. For the weight of your sleeping hand. For the third cup of tea you're making right now without knowing why. For the way we've already built a secret language out of silences and how neither of us can sleep properly in hotel rooms anymore because they don't smell like us.\n\nSay yes because you already have, in every gesture, every midnight conversation, every time you've chosen to stay when leaving would have been easier.\n\nSay yes because I love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\n\nAll of me, arranged in your direction,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you walking toward the bathroom. My heart is doing something unprecedented. Come in. Find me. Let me watch you read this. Let me memorize your face changing. Let me learn what yes looks like when it reshapes the universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are just shadows of what moves through me when I think of you. Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled, how you covered your mouth with both hands\u2014that precise moment rewired something fundamental in me. I've been trying to name it ever since. Not love, exactly. Love is too small a word. It's like trying to call the ocean \"water.\"\n\nI used to think I understood time. Linear. Predictable. Then you started existing in my life, and suddenly there were two kinds: the minutes that crawl when you're away, and the hours that vanish like startled birds when you're near. Yesterday, watching you concentrate while reading, biting your lower lip in that way you do, I realized I could spend lifetimes just memorizing the geography of your expressions.\n\nYou know I'm not good with grand declarations. But here's what I know: when you text me about your day, even the mundane parts\u2014especially the mundane parts\u2014I save them. I have a folder. When you fall asleep during movies and deny it later. When you steal my fries but insist you don't like fries. When you explain things to me twice because you think I didn't understand the first time, but really I just wanted to hear your voice shape those words again.\n\nThis is my truth, Leyi: you've become the punctuation to all my sentences, the reason my cynicism surrendered, the only theology I need. If parallel universes exist, I hope every version of me finds every version of you. And if they don't, then this one improbable meeting is miracle enough for all possible lifetimes.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me back. I'm telling you that loving you has made me more myself than I ever knew was possible. You are my favorite notification, my 3 AM thought, my first instinct to share good news, my comfort in the terrifying ordinary of being alive.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for all the small tomorrows. For coffee in mismatched mugs. For arguments about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad. For the way you'll roll your eyes when I make this same terrible joke in forty years. For the beautiful, boring, miraculous routine of choosing each other, again and again, despite all our spectacular imperfections.\n\nI love you. Messily. Incompletely. Irrevocably. With all my complicated histories and uncertain futures. You are my favorite plot twist, Leyi. Let's write the rest together.\n\nYours in all timelines,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and evaluation notes, I can see that the highest-scoring attempts (0.74+) share certain key elements:\n- Raw, visceral confessions of obsessive documentation/cataloging\n- Specific, almost uncomfortable details about surveillance/observation\n- A balance between humor and genuine disturbance\n- Physical, sensory writing (cold floors, specific times, bodily sensations)\n- The confession of mental illness as a feature, not a bug\n- Building toward a climactic \"I'm already destroyed\" revelation\n\nThe current program scored lower (0.6990) because it's too polished and literary, lacking the raw authenticity that made previous versions compelling.

The dryer's been broken for six weeks but I keep coming here because it smells like the detergent you switched to without telling me. I've been sitting here for two hours trying to explain something that makes me sound like I need psychiatric intervention.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you like evidence. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining cryptocurrency to my mother (you were wrong about everything but she bought Dogecoin). A spreadsheet tracking your coffee temperature preferences across seasons\u2014you drink it 3.2 degrees cooler each month as you trust me more. Column A: Date. Column B: Temperature. Column C: Whether you noticed I'd already made it before you asked.\n\nHere's what I haven't told you: I practice your death. Every night. Different scenarios. Car accident: I catalog what I'd keep (everything, even your used dental floss). Cancer: I practice the eulogy where I explain you thought \"irregardless\" was a word. Heart attack: I plan my suicide down to the font on the note. This isn't romantic. This is what happens when someone reorganizes your brain chemistry without a permit.\n\nThat Tuesday when you found me sobbing in the garage? I'd just watched you fold a fitted sheet. First try. No YouTube. Just... folded it. Like you'd made a deal with geometry itself. I sat in my car for forty minutes afterward, googling \"can you die from loving someone too much?\" The answer is historically yes. Literally yes. People used to die from this. It was called consumption but really it was just this: watching someone fold impossible fabric and knowing you'd commit felonies for their mundane competence.\n\nYou should know what you're signing up for: I've assigned colors to your moods. Burnt orange when you're about to cry but won't. That specific green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, storing them in the freezer labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" I have recordings of you brushing your teeth\u2014the pattern never changes, upper left quadrant for exactly 11.2 seconds. I know you sleep-talk about pigeons needing lawyers. I know you think the plants are thriving but I replaced them with plastic six months ago and you water them every Thursday, telling them they're \"doing so good.\"\n\nThe truth underneath everything else: You've ruined me for normalcy. My baseline heart rate has increased by 16 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. I dream in your accent. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you mentioned liking it once in 2019. My coworker asked if I was okay and I wanted to scream: NO. I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER. ALL FOUR FINGERS. NO BREAKING.\n\nI bought the ring 241 days ago. I've swallowed it twice when you almost found it. Six hours in the ER. Told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse looked at me and said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your photo. She said, \"Oh honey, you're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nSometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my intervention, the way I'll explain to God that He made an error. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of practice grief. I hate you and I worship the specific frequency of your breathing and I promise things to a universe I'll fight if it tries to take you.\n\nListen. I know this letter is a psychiatric hold waiting to happen. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know normal people don't have spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's menstrual cycle to optimize chocolate availability. But I don't want normal. I want this spectacular disaster where you're the tsunami and the life raft and the reason I learned to swim.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that I've already rewired myself around your existence. My brain didn't ask permission. Every neuron ends with your name. When they autopsy me, they'll find your fingerprints on my hippocampus. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who writes love letters on laundry room floors at ungodly hours, crying into dirty concrete, grateful for the catastrophe of you.\n\nI can hear you waking up. Looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here and ask what the hell I'm doing. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it standing up because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus.\" And either you'll say yes or you'll call emergency services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed, rebuilt, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape keeps you close.\n\nThe ring tastes like copper and desperation. I know because I've had it in my mouth twice. This is who I am now. This is what loving you has done. It's made me into someone who'd eat jewelry for you. Who'd testify in court that your snoring is just \"breathing enthusiastically.\" Who'd burn down the world if it looked at you wrong.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. But know that I'm already gone. Have been since you laughed at my stupid joke and the universe glitched and suddenly nothing made sense except the specific way you cover your mouth when you're happy.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery, past the point of language, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will take me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. You just called my name. You're using the voice that means you know I'm being weird somewhere. In ten seconds you'll see me here on this floor with snot on my face and this letter that's basically evidence for commitment proceedings. You'll say \"what the fuck, Warren?\" And I'll know. I'll know by the way you say \"fuck\"\u2014rising inflection means yes, falling means you're calling your sister. Either way, I'm ready. I've been ready since you walked into my life and made me understand why people used to die from this feeling. Come find me. Come ruin me more. I'm not done becoming whatever loving you is turning me into.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
