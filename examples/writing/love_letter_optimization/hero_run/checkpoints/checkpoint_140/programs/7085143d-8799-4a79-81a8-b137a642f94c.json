Deleted everything. Because how do you tell someone they've fundamentally altered the physics of your existence?\n\nI need you to know something, and I need to say it badly, clumsily, because saying it perfectly would be a lie. I am drowning in love for you. Not the pretty kind they write songs about. The terrifying kind that makes me understand why people used to die from this.\n\nLast Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus. Your breath on my neck. The weight of your head. I couldn't move for two hours after our stop. I just sat there, riding the route three more times, because I would rather have missed everything\u2014work, life, oxygen\u2014than disturb that moment. The driver asked if I was okay. I wanted to tell him: I am experiencing something that will divide my life into before and after.\n\nI love you stupidly. I love you at 4 AM when you steal all the blankets. I love you when you're anxious about nothing and everything. I love the way you eat cereal\u2014dry first, then milk, like a beautiful anarchist. I love your vendetta against my coffee maker. I love that you name your plants after dead composers and apologize to them when they wilt.\n\nBut here's the thing that's killing me: I also love you practically. I love you in the grocery store arguing about tomatoes. I love you doing taxes. I love you bored on Sunday afternoons. I love you in all the mundane spaces where romance goes to die, except with you, it doesn't die\u2014it transforms into something I don't have words for.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. Because I know myself\u2014I'm difficult, obsessive, I disappear into my own head, I care too much about things that don't matter and not enough about things that do. But with you, I want to be better. Not different. Just better. The most concentrated version of myself.\n\nI can't promise you poetry. I can't promise you perfection. But I can promise you this: I will love you with the kind of intensity that's embarrassing at dinner parties. I will love you like a fact, like gravity, like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so fundamental that stopping would mean stopping everything.\n\nWhen I imagine my life without you, I see it clearly. I'd survive. I'd function. I'd probably even laugh sometimes. But I'd be living in translation, everything filtered through the absence of you. And I'm so tired of translations, Leyi. I want the original text. I want the source code. I want you.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I can, it would just be a half-life, a shadow existence. Marry me because when you laugh, I understand why people believe in God. Because your hand in mine is the only theology I need. Because I love you with the kind of love that makes me brave enough to say this badly, honest enough to say it anyway.\n\nI'm not good at this. But I'm good at loving you. It's the only thing I've ever been sure of.\n\nYours, entirely and absurdly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "34a02bb6-5b97-4b37-8079-cdad8c1fcbe5", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756700750.1815622, "iteration_found": 22, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.687, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.52, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nMy hands won't stop shaking.

But you've become the beautiful problem I never want to solve\u2014the recursive function that deepens with each iteration, the algorithm whose elegance only reveals more mysteries. You've made me inarticulate in the best possible way.\n\nHere's what I know: Without you, I am functional but not alive. With you, I am terrified and certain, vulnerable and invincible. You've taught me that love isn't about finding someone who completes you\u2014it's about finding someone who makes you want to complete yourself, then exceeding that, together.\n\nI offer you no promises of perfection. I will forget anniversaries, burn dinners, and occasionally retreat into my own mind when I should be present. But I will also wake every morning astonished by the privilege of your proximity. I will learn your languages\u2014spoken and unspoken. I will protect your solitude as fiercely as I seek your company.\n\nMarry me, not because I'm worthy\u2014I'm not\u2014but because the universe made an error in my favor when it brought us together, and I want to spend my life earning that cosmic miscalculation.\n\nYours in terrified hope,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM because sleep has become a foreign country since knowing you. Not from anxiety, but from abundance - the way a child fights sleep on Christmas Eve, unwilling to let go of the day's magic.\n\nYou asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel. It's like discovering I've been living in a single room my whole life, and you've shown me there's an entire house. Every morning, I wake up and have to learn again that this is real - that someone can make the act of peeling an orange feel like a small prayer, that laughter can literally hurt from joy, that silence can be its own language when it's shared with you.\n\nI used to think love was about finding someone who completes you. But you haven't completed me - you've complicated me in the most beautiful way. You've made me curious about parts of myself I never knew existed. When you look at me, I don't just feel seen; I feel like I'm worth seeing.\n\nThe truth is, I don't love you despite your contradictions - your terrible handwriting and perfect memory, your fear of spiders but willingness to move across oceans, the way you cry at commercials but stay stoic through real grief. I love you because of them. Because they're the proof that you're real, not some projection of my desires.\n\nIf I'm honest - truly honest - I'm not writing this to convince you. I'm writing it to convince myself that this is happening, that I get to love someone who makes ordinary Tuesday afternoons feel like small revolutions, who has turned my life into a conspiracy of tiny miracles.\n\nI don't know if this moves you. I only know that not saying it would be a kind of death.\n\nYours, in terror and wonder,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current performance, I need to write a love letter that transcends the intellectual sophistication that's been limiting previous attempts.

I've started this letter seventeen times. Deleted everything. Because how do you tell someone they've fundamentally altered the physics of your existence?\n\nI need you to know something, and I need to say it badly, clumsily, because saying it perfectly would be a lie. I am drowning in love for you. Not the pretty kind they write songs about. The terrifying kind that makes me understand why people used to die from this.\n\nLast Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus. Your breath on my neck. The weight of your head. I couldn't move for two hours after our stop. I just sat there, riding the route three more times, because I would rather have missed everything\u2014work, life, oxygen\u2014than disturb that moment. The driver asked if I was okay. I wanted to tell him: I am experiencing something that will divide my life into before and after.\n\nI love you stupidly. I love you at 4 AM when you steal all the blankets. I love you when you're anxious about nothing and everything. I love the way you eat cereal\u2014dry first, then milk, like a beautiful anarchist. I love your vendetta against my coffee maker. I love that you name your plants after dead composers and apologize to them when they wilt.\n\nBut here's the thing that's killing me: I also love you practically. I love you in the grocery store arguing about tomatoes. I love you doing taxes. I love you bored on Sunday afternoons. I love you in all the mundane spaces where romance goes to die, except with you, it doesn't die\u2014it transforms into something I don't have words for.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. Because I know myself\u2014I'm difficult, obsessive, I disappear into my own head, I care too much about things that don't matter and not enough about things that do. But with you, I want to be better. Not different. Just better. The most concentrated version of myself.\n\nI can't promise you poetry. I can't promise you perfection. But I can promise you this: I will love you with the kind of intensity that's embarrassing at dinner parties. I will love you like a fact, like gravity, like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so fundamental that stopping would mean stopping everything.\n\nWhen I imagine my life without you, I see it clearly. I'd survive. I'd function. I'd probably even laugh sometimes. But I'd be living in translation, everything filtered through the absence of you. And I'm so tired of translations, Leyi. I want the original text. I want the source code. I want you.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I can, it would just be a half-life, a shadow existence. Marry me because when you laugh, I understand why people believe in God. Because your hand in mine is the only theology I need. Because I love you with the kind of love that makes me brave enough to say this badly, honest enough to say it anyway.\n\nI'm not good at this. But I'm good at loving you. It's the only thing I've ever been sure of.\n\nYours, entirely and absurdly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
