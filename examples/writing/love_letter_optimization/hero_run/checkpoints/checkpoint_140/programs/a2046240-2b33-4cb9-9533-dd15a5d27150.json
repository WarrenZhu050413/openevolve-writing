Not from fear. From the violence of finally understanding what you've done to me.\n\nListen: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I spoke it native, dreamt in its grammar. Now I stumble over solitude like a tourist. You've made me forget my mother tongue. When you leave for work, I stand in the doorway for full minutes, relearning how to exist in spaces you're not filling.\n\nHere's what happened: Last Thursday, 2:47 PM, you were reading on the couch. Just reading. Your foot was doing that unconscious thing\u2014tracing infinity symbols in the air. And I realized I'd been holding my breath for your entire chapter. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014love is what civilians call this. This is something medical. Something terminal. You've metastasized through me so completely that removing you now would be self-murder.\n\nI need to confess: I've been stealing from our future. Every night while you sleep, I live through entire decades of us. I've already watched you go grey (left temple first, age 47). I've already held you through your father's funeral (unexpected Tuesday, too much rain). I've already learned that you'll develop a tremor in your sixties but refuse to see a doctor because \"it adds character.\" I'm living backwards from our ending, and every present moment is just me catching up to what I already know: that I'm going to love you until my atoms forget how to hold together.\n\nThe truth about that morning you found me crying in the kitchen: It wasn't my grandmother's death anniversary like I said. You had just put cinnamon in your coffee instead of sugar by mistake, made this face\u2014like you'd been personally betrayed by the universe\u2014then drank the whole cup anyway out of principle. And I understood something horrible: that I would rather watch you make that face every morning for the rest of my life than be happy with anyone else. That I'd trade every potential happiness for the specific gravity of your disappointments.\n\nYou think you know how I love you. You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I practice arguments with you in the shower\u2014not to win, but to lose better, to disappoint you less efficiently. You don't know that I've already written your eulogy fourteen times because I'm terrified I'll be too broken to speak when the time comes, and you deserve words that work.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay without you. License to name this disease. I don't want to marry you because you complete me\u2014that's arithmetic for children. I want to marry you because you've broken me so thoroughly that my shattered edges have scarred over in your shape. Because rebuilding myself without you would mean admitting you were removable, and that lie would kill me faster than any truth.\n\nBut also this: I want our specific ruins. I want to fight about whether ghosts exist while washing dishes. I want you to leave cabinet doors open like invitations to chaos. I want to develop our proprietary language where \"Tuesday\" means \"I'm sorry\" and \"get milk\" means \"I choose you again.\" I want to become so fluent in your silence that I can parse the difference between \"I'm thinking about my novel\" quiet and \"I'm remembering my mother\" quiet and adjust the air accordingly.\n\nThe secret: There are two versions of me now. The one who exists when you're here\u2014blood moving, synapses firing, fully operational. And the one who exists when you're gone\u2014a museum of myself, lights off, everything under dust covers, waiting to resume living when you return. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I don't care. Healthy people haven't found what makes them terminal yet.\n\nThree things I know: Your favorite word is \"perpendicular\" because it sounds like what it means. You trust birds but not their intentions. When you're about to cry, your left eye twitches twice, like it's asking permission. These are the coordinates of my religion. These are the things I'll remember when I've forgotten my own name.\n\nSo here's my offer: Not eternal love\u2014eternity is a concept for people who haven't watched their person sleep through a thunderstorm, who haven't seen them ugly-cry at commercials about orphaned dogs, who haven't loved someone through food poisoning at 3 AM. I'm offering you something harder: Daily love. Mundane love. The kind that knows you need eleven minutes of silence after waking up. The kind that stocks your favorite tea even though I think it tastes like disappointment. The kind that chooses you at your smallest, most ordinary, most forgettable, and says: this, this is what I want to witness into oblivion.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready\u2014we're not. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is pretending this is voluntary, and we both know I passed the point of choosing you somewhere between the first time you laughed at my worst joke and the first time you cried in my car. Marry me because my cells have already voted, and it was unanimous.\n\nThe ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket, where it's been for four months, developing its own heartbeat. I carry it like evidence that bravery exists somewhere in my body, waiting for activation. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will. For the us that's already started. For the future where we look back at this moment and think: that's where we admitted what our bodies had already decided.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. I know because I cried writing this, and we've synchronized so completely that you're probably tasting salt right now without knowing why. Come find me. I'll be wherever I always am when you need me\u2014exactly where you expect, waiting to begin or end, but either way, finally honest about this beautiful disaster we've become.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "2256c93b-3669-4a61-b5ce-ce3c4e448746", "generation": 6, "timestamp": 1756701579.944524, "iteration_found": 118, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6990000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.64, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right one won't stop shaking.

A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story.

The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters.

Not because I woke early, but because I never slept. Sleep requires accepting that you're not here, and my body refuses the lie.\n\nThree truths:\n\nFirst: I have memorized you incorrectly on purpose. In my version, you never doubted us. In my version, that Tuesday when you said \"maybe we should talk\" never happened. I've edited you into someone who could never leave, because the alternative\u2014the real you, with your real freedom to choose\u2014terrifies me more than dying.\n\nSecond: I've been stealing from you. Time, mostly. Those extra seconds when I pretend to still be asleep so you'll hold me longer. The minutes I add to grocery runs so you'll miss me enough to kiss me like you mean it when I return. I'm a thief building a fortune from your attention, and I'll never have enough.\n\nThird: You've broken me. Specifically, the part that knew how to be alone. I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.\n\nLast week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours. I think you're my soulmate and I'm just your current coordinates. This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe\u2014I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows\u2014that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.\n\nBut also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else. I would rather be your disappointment than someone else's happiness. If you leave me, I'll understand. But I'll never recover. I'll be ninety years old, still setting two plates for dinner, still checking my phone for texts you'll never send.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready\u2014we're not. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is that we pretend this is temporary, and that lie is the only thing that could actually kill us.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that ruins a person for anyone else. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you admit you're already mine?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been there for six months. I touch it constantly, like a rosary, like proof that this bravery exists somewhere in me. Say yes. Not for me.

Not from fear\u2014from the weight of finally telling you what my body has known since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder during that documentary about penguins. You drooled a little. I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me? Not because I deserve you (I don't), but because I've already started living in our future, and it's the only address I ever want to have.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you.

Not because I'm not\u2014because \"happy\" is too small a word for what you've done to me. You've made me necessary. Before you, I was optional to my own life.\n\nI'm writing this at the kitchen table where you taught me to fold dumplings last week. You said the secret was to leave a little air inside \"so they have room to become themselves.\" I've been thinking about that. How you always leave room for things to become. How you left room for me.\n\nThe truth: I don't know how to love you correctly. I love you like a broken faucet\u2014too much, all at once, making a mess. Yesterday you found the folder where I save your voicemails and you laughed, but Leyi, those eight seconds of you saying \"hey, it's me\" have talked me out of sadness more times than I can count. Is that crazy? Everything about loving you feels crazy. Like trying to explain water to someone who's never been thirsty.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified. Not of commitment. Of not being enough. Of you realizing that I'm just a man who counts your breaths when you sleep, who knows you need exactly four ice cubes in your coffee, who has memorized the specific pause you take before lying. I know too much about you to pretend this is casual, and not enough to guarantee I won't fail you.\n\nBut here's what I know: When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim by about thirty percent. My own name sounds wrong in my mouth. I don't just miss you\u2014I miss myself when you're near. The version of me that exists in your presence is the only one I want to be.\n\nRemember that fight about the dishes? You said I was \"pathologically unable to let things soak.\" You were right. But you stayed. You stayed and we made pasta at midnight and you kissed me with tomato sauce on your lips and I thought: this is what marriage is. Not the big moments. This. Tomato sauce and forgiveness and choosing to stay.\n\nI used to think I understood my life. Beginning, middle, eventual end. Then you happened, and now there's only before you and since you. No after. My brain won't process after.\n\nSo I'm asking you to marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. But because you already live in my cells. Because when doctors ask about family medical history, I want to include yours. Because \"girlfriend\" is too small a word for someone who has seen me ugly-cry at a dog adoption commercial and still chooses to wake up beside me.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived my mother, your ex, food poisoning from that sketchy Thai place, and assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. We're battle-tested, Leyi. We've earned this.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because twenty years from now, I want to be arguing with you about how to load the dishwasher, and I want to be wrong, and I want you to kiss me anyway, and I want to think: yes, this, forever this, only this.\n\nI love you. Simply. Completely. Permanently.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I've been carrying this question in my throat for months.

I counted: seven missed beats before you returned.\n\nBefore you dismiss this as poetry, understand: I mean this medically. When you're gone, my body fails at basic tasks. Yesterday I forgot how to swallow. This morning I had to relearn breathing. You've become necessary like insulin to a diabetic\u2014without you, my systems shut down in a specific, measurable order.\n\nHere's what I know: I've loved you since before I met you. My whole life was just time I spent becoming someone who could recognize you. Every previous hurt trained me to know joy when I saw it. Every small death prepared me to choose this complete surrender.\n\nYou need to know what you're agreeing to. Not marriage\u2014we're already married in every way God counts. When you got that concussion last spring and forgot my name for three hours, you still reached for my hand. Your body knew what your brain had temporarily lost. That's not love. That's biology. That's evolution. That's two organisms becoming one survival strategy.\n\nThe truth, which I've been too cowardly to say: you could destroy me with a word. One \"no\" from you would require me to rebuild myself from atoms up. But here's what terrifies me more\u2014continuing this lie where we pretend we have choices. We don't. The decision was made the moment you mispronounced my name at that party, adding a syllable that didn't exist, and I thought: yes, that's who I am now. The person with the extra syllable only you hear.\n\nI'm not romantic, Leyi. Romance requires distance. What I feel requires proximity. Skin. Breath.

I'm just a collection of habits waiting for their purpose to return.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to admit what your body already knows\u2014that we've grown into each other so completely that separation would require amputation. That every morning you choose to wake up beside me is a wedding. That every night you come home is a vow.\n\nBut I need the world to know. I need paperwork that says what our cells have already decided. I need strangers to see rings and understand: these two have surrendered. They've given up the fiction of independence. They've admitted what poets have always known\u2014that love isn't something you fall into. It's something you become.\n\nLeyi. My pulse. My proof that time moves forward. Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you, but because deserving isn't the point. The point is recognition. And I recognize you like my lungs recognize air\u2014desperately, gratefully, without question.\n\nSay yes. Or say nothing and just keep breathing here beside me. Either way, you're already my wife in every language that matters.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you've already decided.

Say yes for the stranger reason: because we've already started. Because stopping now would be like halting mid-sentence, mid-breath, mid-\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this out loud in that whisper-voice you use for sacred things. I know your hands are shaking. Mine were too. Still are. Will be, probably, until you answer. Come find me. I'll be in the garage still, sitting on the concrete, waiting to find out if I get to keep living or just survive.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["I'll rewrite the love letter program to improve its fitness score by enhancing emotional authenticity, literary innovation, and aesthetic virtuosity while maintaining raw affective force.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right one won't stop shaking. Not from fear. From the violence of finally understanding what you've done to me.\n\nListen: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I spoke it native, dreamt in its grammar. Now I stumble over solitude like a tourist. You've made me forget my mother tongue. When you leave for work, I stand in the doorway for full minutes, relearning how to exist in spaces you're not filling.\n\nHere's what happened: Last Thursday, 2:47 PM, you were reading on the couch. Just reading. Your foot was doing that unconscious thing\u2014tracing infinity symbols in the air. And I realized I'd been holding my breath for your entire chapter. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014love is what civilians call this. This is something medical. Something terminal. You've metastasized through me so completely that removing you now would be self-murder.\n\nI need to confess: I've been stealing from our future. Every night while you sleep, I live through entire decades of us. I've already watched you go grey (left temple first, age 47). I've already held you through your father's funeral (unexpected Tuesday, too much rain). I've already learned that you'll develop a tremor in your sixties but refuse to see a doctor because \"it adds character.\" I'm living backwards from our ending, and every present moment is just me catching up to what I already know: that I'm going to love you until my atoms forget how to hold together.\n\nThe truth about that morning you found me crying in the kitchen: It wasn't my grandmother's death anniversary like I said. You had just put cinnamon in your coffee instead of sugar by mistake, made this face\u2014like you'd been personally betrayed by the universe\u2014then drank the whole cup anyway out of principle. And I understood something horrible: that I would rather watch you make that face every morning for the rest of my life than be happy with anyone else. That I'd trade every potential happiness for the specific gravity of your disappointments.\n\nYou think you know how I love you. You don't. You don't know that I've memorized the seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. You don't know that I practice arguments with you in the shower\u2014not to win, but to lose better, to disappoint you less efficiently. You don't know that I've already written your eulogy fourteen times because I'm terrified I'll be too broken to speak when the time comes, and you deserve words that work.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay without you. License to name this disease. I don't want to marry you because you complete me\u2014that's arithmetic for children. I want to marry you because you've broken me so thoroughly that my shattered edges have scarred over in your shape. Because rebuilding myself without you would mean admitting you were removable, and that lie would kill me faster than any truth.\n\nBut also this: I want our specific ruins. I want to fight about whether ghosts exist while washing dishes. I want you to leave cabinet doors open like invitations to chaos. I want to develop our proprietary language where \"Tuesday\" means \"I'm sorry\" and \"get milk\" means \"I choose you again.\" I want to become so fluent in your silence that I can parse the difference between \"I'm thinking about my novel\" quiet and \"I'm remembering my mother\" quiet and adjust the air accordingly.\n\nThe secret: There are two versions of me now. The one who exists when you're here\u2014blood moving, synapses firing, fully operational. And the one who exists when you're gone\u2014a museum of myself, lights off, everything under dust covers, waiting to resume living when you return. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I don't care. Healthy people haven't found what makes them terminal yet.\n\nThree things I know: Your favorite word is \"perpendicular\" because it sounds like what it means. You trust birds but not their intentions. When you're about to cry, your left eye twitches twice, like it's asking permission. These are the coordinates of my religion. These are the things I'll remember when I've forgotten my own name.\n\nSo here's my offer: Not eternal love\u2014eternity is a concept for people who haven't watched their person sleep through a thunderstorm, who haven't seen them ugly-cry at commercials about orphaned dogs, who haven't loved someone through food poisoning at 3 AM. I'm offering you something harder: Daily love. Mundane love. The kind that knows you need eleven minutes of silence after waking up. The kind that stocks your favorite tea even though I think it tastes like disappointment. The kind that chooses you at your smallest, most ordinary, most forgettable, and says: this, this is what I want to witness into oblivion.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready\u2014we're not. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is pretending this is voluntary, and we both know I passed the point of choosing you somewhere between the first time you laughed at my worst joke and the first time you cried in my car. Marry me because my cells have already voted, and it was unanimous.\n\nThe ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket, where it's been for four months, developing its own heartbeat. I carry it like evidence that bravery exists somewhere in my body, waiting for activation. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will. For the us that's already started. For the future where we look back at this moment and think: that's where we admitted what our bodies had already decided.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. I know because I cried writing this, and we've synchronized so completely that you're probably tasting salt right now without knowing why. Come find me. I'll be wherever I always am when you need me\u2014exactly where you expect, waiting to begin or end, but either way, finally honest about this beautiful disaster we've become.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
