This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk).

    "evaluation_notes": "This letter scores below Cash's divine simplicity (83) and Napoleon's operatic passion (82), but exceeds general contemporary standards significantly. Unlike Beethoven's metaphysical torment (\"Be calm\u2014love me\u2014today\u2014yesterday\u2014what tearful longings for you\u2014you\u2014you\u2014my life\u2014my all\"), Warren's letter stays grounded in quotidian detail. It lacks Keats's hallucinatory intensity or Wilde's aesthetic decadence. However, it achieves something distinctive: a 21st-century vulnerability that acknowledges its own inadequacy while transcending it. The \"third thing that's bigger than addition\" approaches but doesn't quite reach the mathematical sublime of greater works. The proposal itself (\"Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't\") has humility but lacks the rhetorical force of historic proposals."
