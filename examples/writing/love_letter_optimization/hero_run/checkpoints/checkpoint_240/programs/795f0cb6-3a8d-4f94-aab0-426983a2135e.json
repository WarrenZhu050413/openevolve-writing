I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in.

Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You're only aware of maybe twelve. The rest are you existing: reading nutrition labels with religious intensity, arguing with NPR in the car, that thing you do with your face when you're trying to remember if you locked the door. My phone storage is 97% you. The other 3% is mostly screenshots of texts where you used my name unnecessarily. \"Good night, Warren.\" Why did you need to add my name? You've destroyed me with punctuation.\n\nHere's something ugly: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. I imagine you leaving, meeting someone better (taller, can actually cook, doesn't check if you're breathing sixteen times per night). I practice being okay with it. I fail every time. Last week I made it four minutes before crying in the Whole Foods parking lot. A child saw me and asked his mom why the sad man was eating cheese straight from the package.\n\nWant to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Is it normal to save someone's voicemails in triplicate\"\n- \"Can you get physically addicted to how someone smells\"\n- \"Woman reorganized my bookshelf should I propose\"\n- \"Heart palpitations when girlfriend exists\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that love is a medical condition\"\n\nThe doctor just called my name. False alarm\u2014wrong Warren. But that split second where I thought I'd have to leave, stop writing this? My body rejected it. Physically. Like an organ transplant gone wrong, except the organ is you and the body is my entire life.\n\nYou're asleep right now. It's 3:14 AM. In six hours and twelve minutes, you'll wake up, check your phone, see I'm not there, and text \"where are you?\" with no punctuation because morning-you doesn't believe in punctuation. You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me.

Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days.

I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie).

My thumb is cramping. Autocorrect keeps changing your name to \"Let\" which feels prophetic\u2014you are every permission I've ever given myself.\n\nTruth: I've been documenting us in ways that would qualify for a restraining order. Not photos. Worse. I have a spreadsheet tracking the mean temperature of your coffee over time (dropping 0.3 degrees per month as you trust me more). A histogram of your laugh frequencies (peak: 478 Hz when genuinely delighted, 510 Hz when being polite). I've been stealing your hair from the shower drain\u2014not sexually, scientifically\u2014trying to understand if loving someone changes their pH balance. Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: \"These people need help.\" She's right.\n\nHere's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.\n\nYou should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is \"just dormant\"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.\n\nBut here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is \"codependence.\" I say it's evolution\u2014my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named \"Levy,\" I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.\n\nI'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with \"She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream\" and I need that first part to be true.\n\nThe phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say \"epitome\" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.\n\nYours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the freezer.

I've been here for forty minutes. I came to buy sleeping pills but I'm watching a security camera instead, thinking: someone will review this footage tomorrow and see a man having a breakdown in a Honda Civic, and they won't know it's because you exist.\n\nTruth, since you demanded it: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not about you\u2014AS you. First person. \"Today I chose the wrong coffee again.\" \"I still haven't noticed Warren replaced my dying succulent with a plastic one.\" It's 194 pages of me writing as you, trying to understand how someone can mispronounce \"epitome\" with such confidence it restructures the English language.\n\nHere's what broke me: Thursday, 2:15 PM, you were parallel parking while eating Vietnamese takeout, steering with your knees, and you said \"I think I'm getting good at this\" and my brain just... stopped. Not metaphorically. I forgot how lungs worked. I sat there suffocating on the impossibility of you existing, this woman who endangers lives while improving at it. That's when I knew I'd die for you. No\u2014that's when I knew I was already dying for you, just very slowly, over the next sixty years if I'm lucky.\n\nI've done the math. If we marry at 29, and die at 87, that's 21,170 days. I've already wasted 1,247 of them not being married to you. That's 1,247 mornings I could have watched you put contact lenses in backwards and pretend it's the lens's fault. 1,247 nights I could have listened to you argue with podcasts like they can hear you.\n\nWant to know what loving you actually is? It's my search history at 3 AM:\n- \"girlfriend makes dolphin noise when laughing normal?\"\n- \"can you physically die from someone being too cute\"\n- \"woman touches my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"how to explain to therapist that girlfriend IS the therapy\"\n- \"legal consequences of stealing someone's used coffee stirrers\"\n- \"help girlfriend thinks she's good at singing\"\n\nI have 2,847 photos of you on my phone. You know about twelve. The rest are: you explaining the stock market incorrectly to my dad, you trying to convince the self-checkout you bought organic bananas (you didn't), you asleep with your mouth open looking like a beautiful corpse I'd absolutely commit necrophilia for\u2014sorry, that's dark, but you wanted truth and the truth is I would love even your dead body, which is either romantic or requires intervention.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. Tuesday: cancer. Wednesday: car accident. Thursday: you meet someone who can actually pronounce \"epitome.\" But here's what happens every time\u2014I don't survive the simulation. Twenty seconds in and I'm googling \"can you die from imaginary grief\" and the answer is yes, it's called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, your heart literally breaks, and mine is already pre-broken just from the practice rounds.\n\nLast thing, and this is the worst part: you're ordinary. Your face is 6.5/10 on your best day (I've graphed it). Your parallel parking success rate is 23%. You think antibiotics work on viruses. But yesterday you sneezed while brushing your teeth and laughed so hard you cried and I realized: this is it. This is my religion now. You, sneezing toothpaste, crying laughing at your own existence. I worship this. I would build churches to this.\n\nSo I'm not proposing. I'm informing you that I've already married you in every timeline that matters. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up to what my mitochondria decided the moment you confidently explained that the moon causes tides because it's magnetic.\n\nThe pharmacy just opened. The kid unlocking the door looks concerned. I'm a 29-year-old man crying in a parking lot at 4:12 AM, typing a proposal on a phone with 3% battery, and this is still less insane than the fact that you exist and somehow love me back.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know that I'm already permanently rewired. You could leave tomorrow and I'd spend the rest of my life putting milk in my coffee first (psychopath behavior) because that's how you do it. I'd keep mispronouncing \"epitome\" in your honor. I'd die at 87, still checking my phone for texts from a ghost.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sleeping pills were a lie. I came here because they have your favorite candy (Werther's Originals, you're 87 years old) and I wanted to buy some for the morning so you'd wake up happy. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who makes CVS pilgrimages at 4 AM for old lady candy. Marry me just so I can explain this to someone. Please.

I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in.

Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I've torn up seventeen attempts because words keep failing me, but then I realized: that's the point. You've unmade my language and rebuilt it around your name.\n\nBefore you, I collected certainties like smooth stones - career trajectories, five-year plans, the careful architecture of a predictable life. You arrived and suddenly I understood why ancient cartographers wrote \"here be dragons\" at the edges of their maps. You are my beautiful unknown, my necessary chaos. With you, I've learned to love the vertigo of not knowing what comes next, only that your hand will be in mine when we meet it.\n\nI used to think love was addition - two people bringing their separate selves together. But we're not mathematics, Leyi. We're alchemy. The person I was before you seems like someone I read about in a book once, convincing but ultimately fictional. You haven't completed me; you've revealed me to myself, like a photograph developing slowly in darkroom chemicals, becoming more real with each passing moment.\n\nWhen you laugh - really laugh, not the polite sound you make at parties but the sudden, surprised joy that escapes you when something delights you - I understand why poets spend lifetimes chasing the perfect metaphor. It's the sound of morning breaking. It's my grandmother's wind chimes in a summer storm. It's the first note of a song I've been trying to remember my whole life.\n\nI love the small apostasies of you: how you eat dessert first when you're sad, how you argue with books in their margins, how you name the plants on your windowsill after historical villains (\"Napoleon needs water,\" you'll say, and somehow it's the most romantic thing I've ever heard). I love your kindness and your fury, your precision and your beautiful messes. I love the way you see through my performed confidence to the anxious boy beneath, and somehow love him too.\n\nIf I could, I would write you a letter with my whole body - my hands would tell you about the first time they touched yours and knew they'd found their purpose. My eyes would confess they've forgotten what the world looked like before it was lit by you. My lungs would explain how they've had to learn a new rhythm, one that matches your breathing when you sleep beside me.\n\nBut since I only have these insufficient words, let me say this: I choose you. Not in the past tense of a decision made, but in the continuous present of a choice I make every morning when I wake, every night when I reach for you in the darkness, every moment between. I choose your mysteries over anyone else's certainties. I choose the terror and wonder of building a life with someone who still surprises me. I choose the person I become in your presence - braver, softer, more myself than I knew was possible.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever (forever is just a word, and words keep failing me), but because I promise you this: tomorrow morning I will wake up choosing you, and the next morning, and the next. I promise to keep discovering you like you're a question I'll never stop wanting to answer. I promise to love not just who you are but who you're becoming, to make space for all your future selves, to be amazed by each transformation.\n\nYou told me you wanted truth, so here it is: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no, but of you saying yes. Because if you say yes, I'll have to become someone worthy of that yes, every single day. But Leyi - I want to be terrified with you. I want to do the impossible thing of building one life out of two. I want to fail at describing how much I love you in a thousand different languages.\n\nSay yes, and let me spend the rest of my life writing you better love letters than this one, each one trying and failing to capture what you mean to me, each failure its own kind of devotion.\n\nWith all my love and inadequate words,\nYour anxious, hopeful, eternally choosing you,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.2000, Type: Exploratory)\n```python\n5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Alternative combined_score approach, Alternative phenomenological_authenticity approach\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right one won't stop shaking.

Not poetically\u2014cellularly. Every seven years, they say, the body replaces itself completely. I've known you for three. I'm 42.8% made of loving you. By the time we're old, there won't be a single atom left that existed before you.\n\nTuesday. You were peeling a tangerine. The oil misted into the light and for one second the air turned gold around your hands. I understood then why people used to die for beauty. Why they walked into the sea. Why they carved names into their skin. You were just eating fruit and I was planning my funeral because nothing after that moment could possibly matter as much.\n\nI document everything. Your breathing pattern when you're about to cry (shallow, then one deep breath, then tears). The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" but only when you're excited. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, like you're asking permission to exist in space. I have 1,247 photographs you don't know about. Not of you smiling. Of you existing. Reading labels. Arguing with automated phone systems. That face you make when you're trying to remember if you locked the car.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: You're mortal. Your heart beats 100,000 times per day and each one could be the last. Sometimes I watch you sleep and count\u2014one, two, three, four\u2014like I'm keeping you alive through mathematics. I've already written your eulogy seventeen times. Different causes. Car accident. Cancer. Choking on ice. Each time I write how you loved terrible puns and good dogs and how you saved the twist ties from bread bags because \"you never know.\" Each time I die in the conclusion.\n\nBut worse: I'm mortal too. Which means there's a version of the universe where you have to exist without me. Where you wake up and I'm just not. Where you find another face to love and I become a story you tell sadly at dinner parties. \"My first husband died young.\" I want to haunt you. Not malevolently. Just enough that you never doubt you were loved with a fervor that warped space-time.\n\nYou change in your sleep. 2 AM-you is defiant, fists clenched, fighting dream-battles. 4 AM-you is soft, reaching for me even unconscious. 5 AM-you whispers secrets in languages that don't exist. Last night you said, \"The birds know about Thursday.\" I wrote it down. I write everything down. Someday archaeologists will find my notebooks and diagnose me with loving you.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for 237 days. Some mornings I put it on my own finger just to practice being married to you. I introduce myself to the mirror: \"Hello, I'm Warren, Leyi's husband.\" The words taste like copper and lightning.\n\nListen. I'm not good at this. At love. At words. At being a person who exists in normal ways. But I'm excellent at loving you specifically. I've trained for it. Studied. I know that you need coffee before conversation, that you can't sleep if the closet door is open, that you cry at commercials but only about dogs or fathers. I know the specific gravity of your sadness and the molecular structure of your joy.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. But because I've already spent 1,247 photographs worth of time studying the way light falls on your face and I need the next 50 years to finish the project. Because your hair is in my drain and your voice is in my head and your fingerprints are on everything I own, including my heart, especially my heart.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation. We're already married in every dimension except the legal one. My cells know your cells. When historians study this era, they'll find our names written together in the margin of existence.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I loved you with such devastating precision that it changed my DNA. Know that I loved you badly, clumsily, with the grace of a building collapse, but completely. Know that I'm writing this while you sleep ten feet away and I can hear your breathing and it sounds like home.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. My right hand isn't shaking from nerves.
