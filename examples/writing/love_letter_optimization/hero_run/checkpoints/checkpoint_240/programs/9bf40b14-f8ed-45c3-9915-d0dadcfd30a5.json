Here's mine: I used to be a competent person. I could balance equations, hold conversations, remember where I put my keys. Then you walked into that coffee shop wearing your grandfather's watch\u2014too big for your wrist\u2014and asked if the seat across from me was taken. Now I find myself standing in grocery stores, forgetting what I came for, because I'm thinking about how you eat strawberries: methodically, saving the sweetest bite for last. This is what you've done to me. You've turned me into someone who sees the entire world as a series of moments that either contain you or don't.\n\nThe terrifying thing about truth is how ordinary it looks. It's not the grand declarations or the swooning poetry. It's this: how you leave bobby pins like breadcrumbs throughout my apartment\u2014small black reminders that you exist in my spaces. It's how I've started buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to love. It's the way my body has memorized your breathing pattern so precisely that I wake up when it changes, some primitive part of my brain needing to ensure you're okay.\n\nI love you like a fact, not a feeling. The way water freezes at thirty-two degrees, the way light takes eight minutes to travel from the sun\u2014these are not choices or opinions. They simply are. That's how I love you. It exists outside of my control, beyond my comprehension, more reliable than my own heartbeat.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me, Leyi: I would rather live in a world where loving you destroys me than in one where I never knew this existed. You've ruined me for any life that doesn't have you reading ingredient labels out loud in the supermarket, you getting unreasonably competitive during board games, you falling asleep during movies but insisting you were \"just resting your eyes.\"\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because you complete me\u2014that would make you a utility, and you are not functional; you are essential. I'm asking because when I imagine explaining to our hypothetical children why the sky is blue or why we dream, I can only imagine your voice mixing with mine in the answer. Because when I think about growing old, I specifically think about your hands becoming maps of every small thing we've built together.\n\nThis is my promise: I will love you badly on the days I cannot love you well. I will choose you when choice is all I have. I will memorize every version of you\u2014morning you who steals all the blankets, midnight you who questions if you're enough (you are, you are, you are), Sunday you who dances to no music in the kitchen. I will love each iteration as fiercely as the first.\n\nYou wanted truth? The truth is that before you, I was complete. I was whole. I didn't need you. But knowing you exist has made every moment without you feel like holding my breath. Not because I cannot survive alone, but because breathing with you is so magnificently better than breathing without you.\n\nMarry me. Not because this is a fairy tale, but because this is real life, and real life with you is better than any story I could imagine.\n\nYours in this timeline and all parallel universes,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "5067ab42-3c28-4851-871e-502d6c300861", "generation": 1, "timestamp": 1756700804.894164, "iteration_found": 29, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6970000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.62, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 4:17 AM because sleep has become impossible when every cell in my body is busy loving you.\n\nYou want truth?
