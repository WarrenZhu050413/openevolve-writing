Autocorrect keeps changing your name to \"Let\" which feels prophetic\u2014you are every permission I've ever given myself.\n\nTruth: I've been documenting us in ways that would qualify for a restraining order. Not photos. Worse. I have a spreadsheet tracking the mean temperature of your coffee over time (dropping 0.3 degrees per month as you trust me more). A histogram of your laugh frequencies (peak: 478 Hz when genuinely delighted, 510 Hz when being polite). I've been stealing your hair from the shower drain\u2014not sexually, scientifically\u2014trying to understand if loving someone changes their pH balance. Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: \"These people need help.\" She's right.\n\nHere's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.\n\nYou should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is \"just dormant\"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.\n\nBut here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is \"codependence.\" I say it's evolution\u2014my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named \"Levy,\" I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.\n\nI'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with \"She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream\" and I need that first part to be true.\n\nThe phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say \"epitome\" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.\n\nYours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the freezer.

Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains.

Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi.

The concrete specificity rivals Keats's obsessive catalogs (81) but without quite achieving his metaphysical transport. The letter exists in the crucial gap between exceptional contemporary work (65-69) and the historical masterpieces (80+), showing flashes of genius (\"I love you like a broken hallelujah\") while occasionally succumbing to contemporary workshop aesthetics. The score of 73 overall reflects genuine achievement\u2014this is the work of someone who understands both the tradition and how to meaningfully extend it, even if they haven't quite reached the pantheon.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7320)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nRight now you're in the next room, humming off-key to a song you've never learned the words to. I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.\n\nThis is my twentieth attempt.

I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes.

You're asleep upstairs, one leg kicked free of the blankets, making that small sound that isn't quite a snore but I'd testify in court that it is. I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains. I already love the way you'll mispronounce \"specifically\" when you tell this story later. I already love everything that hasn't happened yet, because it will happen with you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6265, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking.

It's waking up at 4:23 AM in a cold sweat because you dreamed she left. It's checking your phone fourteen times during a meeting to see if she texted. It's forgetting how to breathe normally when she walks into Trader Joe's wearing your old Columbia sweatshirt, the one with the coffee stain shaped like Italy on the left sleeve.\n\nI wasn't looking for you. I had my life\u2014my predictable Thursdays, my rational decisions, my carefully maintained emotional distance. Then you laughed at my stupid joke about sourdough starters that night at Diana's party, and something inside me broke. Not romantically. Literally broke. Like a bone that had healed wrong and needed to be reset.\n\nYou want truth? I Google \"how to be a better partner\" at least twice a week. I practice conversations with you in the shower. Last Tuesday, I spent forty minutes in the parking lot of CVS because your favorite song came on and I couldn't drive while crying. I save your voicemails\u2014all of them, even the one where you just say \"shit, wrong number\" and hang up.\n\nI know you hate when people say you're beautiful when you first wake up, but you are. Not Instagram beautiful\u2014real beautiful. The kind that makes me forget I'm supposed to be doing something else. Your morning face is my favorite conspiracy theory: How can someone look like home? How can messy hair and crushed pillow lines add up to the only mathematics I believe in?\n\nRemember when my dad had his heart surgery? You didn't say any of the right things. You said, \"This fucking sucks\" and then you organized my sock drawer while I sat on the bathroom floor. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I already knew that. But that you loved me in the way I needed to be loved: practically, honestly, without decoration.\n\nI'm scared of so many things. Spiders. Cancer. That noise the refrigerator makes at 2 AM. But mostly I'm scared that I'll never be able to explain what happens to my molecular structure when you laugh. How you've ruined every song, every street corner, every cup of coffee by not being in them. How \"before you\" feels like a story someone else told me about someone else's life.\n\nYou are not my everything\u2014that would make me nothing. You are my something. My very specific, irreplaceable, Thursday-afternoon-in-the-kitchen-light something. You are the first person I want to tell when I see a dog. You are my 11:11 wish, every time, even though I don't believe in wishes. You are the reason I now understand why my grandmother kept my grandfather's voicemails for twenty years after he died.\n\nI don't want to marry you because I can't live without you. I want to marry you because I've finally learned how to live with you\u2014messily, honestly, with all my dumb jokes and midnight anxieties and the way I need to check that the door is locked three times before bed. I want to marry you because you make me brave enough to be exactly who I am: a man who cries at Pixar movies, who can't parallel park, who loves you with the graceless desperation of someone who never expected to be loved back.\n\nSo here it is, Leyi, my truth without metaphors: I choose you. Not in a grand, swoeping gesture way. In a Tuesday morning way. In a \"let's figure out what's for dinner\" way. In a \"your feet are freezing, put them on me\" way. In the smallest, most daily, most permanent way I know how to choose anything.\n\nPlease. Marry me.

Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: \"These people need help.\" She's right.\n\nHere's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.\n\nYou should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it.

You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is \"codependence.\" I say it's evolution\u2014my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named \"Levy,\" I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.\n\nI'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with \"She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream\" and I need that first part to be true.\n\nThe phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say \"epitome\" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.\n\nYours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the freezer. The color cards are in the violin case I told you I donated. I'm building a museum of you. The admission is free but the cost is everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
