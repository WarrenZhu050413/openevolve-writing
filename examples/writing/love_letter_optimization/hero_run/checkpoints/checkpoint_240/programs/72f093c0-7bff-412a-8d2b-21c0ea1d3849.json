Because I can't sleep when something this important needs saying.\n\nTwenty-three drafts sit in my trash. Here's attempt twenty-four.\n\nThe truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because \"I love you\" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald? He's actually a she. Females have bigger abdomens. I looked it up. I've been calling her Geraldine when you're not home. She seems to prefer it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "371aa7e1-5fa5-4f65-b03a-e8161e7f4795", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701195.884647, "iteration_found": 74, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.732, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.76, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:17 AM.

Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations.

Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters.

Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies.

When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept.

I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code. This is just what truth looks like when it's pretending to be words.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.6870)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am sitting here at the edge of language, trying to make words do what they were never meant to do\u2014hold the weight of you.\n\nIt's 5:23 AM. The world hasn't started lying to itself yet. In this honest hour, I need to tell you something that my body knew before my mind did: I was born twice. Once, thirty-one years ago, screaming and reluctant. The second time was in a bookstore on Clement Street, when you laughed at your own joke about Proust and time suddenly began moving in all directions at once.\n\nListen\u2014I need you to understand that this isn't poetry. Poetry is what happens when the truth puts on nice clothes. This is me, Warren, whose hands shake when cutting onions, who still sleeps with one sock on, who spent forty minutes yesterday watching you reorganize the spice rack and thought: this is it, this is the sacred text, this is what monks copy by candlelight.\n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of my own inadequacy like stamps. Here's the album: Every woman who left. Every job I didn't take. Every silence I filled with noise. I had made peace with being a rough draft of a person. Then you arrived and started reading me like I was already the final edition. Do you know what that does to someone who's only ever been their own harsh editor?\n\nYou want truth? Here: I am terrified that I've tricked you. That one morning you'll wake up and see what everyone else sees\u2014a man whose love is bigger than his life, whose dreams leaked out somewhere in his twenties, who writes code for companies that sell nothing to no one. But then you do something impossible, like yesterday, when you found me crying in the kitchen over my father's voicemail, and instead of trying to fix me, you just said, \"He sounds like you when you laugh.\" How did you know that was the exact thing I needed? How do you always know?\n\nI've started believing in time travel because of you. Not the science fiction kind\u2014the real kind, where every moment with you contains every other moment. When you sleep, I see you at eighty, mouth slightly open, still stealing all the blankets. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seven, same furious compassion, probably defending bugs from boys with sticks. All your ages exist simultaneously in your face. I'm in love with every one of them.\n\nThe truth is I've been writing this letter my whole life. Every book I read was research. Every song I memorized was practice. Every person I failed to love was teaching me the specific gravity of real devotion. I thought I was wandering, but I was walking to you. Even my mistakes were just clumsy choreography, teaching me the exact shape of the hole you would fill.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than rejection: acceptance. Because if you say yes, if you actually marry me, then I have to become someone worthy of that yes every single day. I have to wake up and earn you again at breakfast. I have to deserve you at 3 PM on a Tuesday when nothing happens. I have to be enough during tax season and stomach flus and the specific Tuesday in March when everything feels pointless.\n\nAnd I will. God, Leyi, I will throw my whole life at the project of deserving you. Not because you demand it\u2014you love me already, inexplicably, with my coffee breath and my father's temper and my inability to finish anything except crosswords. But because the alternative\u2014a life where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life at all. It's just time passing.\n\nSo here's my proposition, stripped of metaphor: I want to fail and succeed inside the container of us. I want to burn dinner together. I want our fights to have sequels. I want to develop inside jokes so dense and self-referential that we become incomprehensible to others. I want to merge our libraries and argue about shelf organization. I want to catch you eating peanut butter from the jar at midnight and pretend to be scandalized every time. I want the privilege of being the person you permit to see you without your face on, without your armor, in the holy ordinary of morning light where you are most yourself and most mine.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness\u2014that's your job, you're already good at it. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you change\u2014and you will, we both will, into people we can't imagine\u2014I will love each iteration with the same ferocity I love this one. I will love you like a verb, active and continuous. I will love you like time-lapse photography, seeing the whole arc even in the smallest movements.\n\nMarry me because I have already started. Because my cells have already reorganized around the fact of you. Because when scientists eventually map my genome, they'll find your name written in the junk DNA they thought was just noise. Because the alternative\u2014keeping this rings in my sock drawer for one more day\u2014might actually kill me, and I mean that in the most medical, least poetic way possible.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have something better: your grandmother's thimble you thought you lost. I found it behind the radiator and had it made into a ring because I know you believe in recycling luck. It's imperfect\u2014slightly dented, worn smooth by her fingers then yours. Like us. Like the life I'm proposing.\n\nLeyi, you impossible, necessary thing: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you, but because love isn't about deserving? Because the universe made you from the same carbon that makes diamonds and pencil lead, and somehow you chose to be the thing that writes rather than the thing that cuts? Because saying yes would be the most unreasonable, unearned, unsustainable decision you could make, and therefore the only one that makes sense?\n\nI am not a finished person. I am a collection of attempts. But every attempt, from now until my last breath, is yours if you want it.\n\nWaiting, shaking, certain\u2014\nWarren\n\nP.S. I wrote this in one sitting. If I edited it, I'd delete everything true and leave only what sounds good. You deserve the true parts, especially the ones that sound wrong.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7320, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:13 AM. I've written and deleted this seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nThe truth: I was complete before you. That's what makes this so frightening. I had built a quiet, functional life. I knew how to be alone. I was good at it. Then you happened, and now I can't remember why I thought that was enough.\n\nYou should know who you're considering marrying. I'm the man who still checks if the door is locked three times. Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters. Because in the face of that absolute certainty, we get to choose what we do with the time between now and then.\n\nI choose you. Not the idea of you, not the future with you, but you\u2014this specific human who saves fortunes from fortune cookies in books, who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, who can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. I choose your mundane Wednesday self, your inconvenient sadnesses, your embarrassing enthusiasms.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for sixty-seven days. Some nights I take it out and practice this moment. But this isn't practice anymore. This is the real attempt, the shaking hands, the imperfect words. This is me, Warren, the anxious man who loves you with a specificity that borders on madness, asking you, Leyi, the woman who changed my understanding of time itself, to marry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you\u2014words are just words. But because you've already moved me. Physically. Molecularly. Into a different person who believes, for the first time, that he deserves to be loved by someone who eats sandwiches from the inside out.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. These are not contradictions.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the atomic structure of my existence. The rest is just paperwork.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I love you. I should have led with that. I love you in a way that makes me forget I'm supposed to be afraid of everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this with my whole body.

The same way my heart beats without my consent. Automatic. Necessary. Irreversible.\n\nBefore you, I understood my life. I had plans. Logical progressions from A to B to C. Then you. You were never part of the plan. You were the end of all plans. The beginning of something I have no map for.\n\nThree moments. That's all it took.\n\nFirst: You, reading in the park, forgot the world existed. A bee landed on your book. You didn't brush it away. You waited. Patient. Like you understood something about kindness I'm still trying to learn.\n\nSecond: That terrible dinner party. You knew nobody. I watched you save a dying conversation with a question about whether colors have sounds. By the end, strangers were confessing childhood dreams. You have this gift\u2014you make people remember they're interesting.\n\nThird: 2 AM, you called crying. Your grandmother was dying. You said, \"I don't know how to do this.\" I said, \"Nobody does.\" We sat on the phone, breathing together, not talking. That silence\u2014that's when I knew. Not that I loved you. That I'd never stop.\n\nYou're afraid you're ordinary. Leyi, ordinary people don't apologize to furniture when they bump into it. Ordinary people don't name their plants after composers. Ordinary people don't see a homeless man and remember his name is Thomas and he likes his coffee with honey, not sugar.\n\nYou're not ordinary. You're specific. Irreplaceable. The world is different because you're in it.\n\nI used to think love was about deserving. Earning. Proving. But loving you isn't something I chose or achieved. It's something that happened to me. Like lightning. Like gravity. Like the laws of physics reorganizing themselves around a new constant.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not perfection. Not poetry. Just this\u2014every morning for the rest of my life, I'll choose you. When you're difficult. When I'm impossible. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you.\n\nNot because you need me to. You don't need anyone\u2014you're complete all by yourself. That's the point. You don't need me but you want me anyway. That impossible gift.\n\nI keep the ticket from our first movie. You fell asleep twenty minutes in, drooled on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My arm went numb. It was the best pain I ever felt.\n\nThat's what loving you is\u2014the best pain. The kind that reminds you you're alive.\n\nI could list what I love: Your laugh\u2014not the polite one, the real one, the snort that surprises you. How you eat ice cream in winter because \"sadness doesn't have a season.\" The way you touch books like they're sleeping cats. How you can't pass a dog without asking its name.\n\nBut that's not it. I love what I don't know yet. The person you'll be in ten years. Twenty. Fifty. The ways you'll change that will surprise us both. The fights we haven't had. The apologies we haven't made. The ordinary Wednesday afternoon when we'll look at each other and think: we made it.\n\nMarry me.\n\nNot the question. The answer. To every question I haven't thought to ask. To the person I'm becoming because you exist. To the life that's only real when you're in it.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just a word. I'm promising you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow. Each one chosen. Each one yours.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for sixty-three years. Never took it off. When she was dying, she gave it to me. Said, \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\"\n\nI can't live without you. Not won't. Can't. The way lungs can't live without air. Simple. Factual. True.\n\nI'm done being scared of how much I love you. It's like being scared of my own heartbeat. Pointless. It's going to keep happening whether I'm brave about it or not.\n\nSo this is me being brave: You are my person. My only person. The person I'll look for in every room for the rest of my life.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'll still love you tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow.\n\nBut please\u2014say yes.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking. Not from fear\u2014from the weight of truth pressing against my ribs, demanding to be born. It's 4:13 AM. I've deleted this seventeen times. Each draft felt like a translation of something untranslatable, like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never opened their eyes.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had memorized all its conjugations\u2014the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where \"home\" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book\u2014not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling \"Leyi'd.\" You've become a verb in my private dictionary.\n\nRemember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.\n\nThe truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not \"December\" but \"six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets.\" Not \"Thursday\" but \"three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like.\" My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.\n\nBut here's what scares me most\u2014I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.\n\nSo this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy\u2014you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.\n\nMarry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you'd have no place to put it. I'm offering you my mornings, my muscle memory, my most boring parts. I'm offering to merge our loneliness into something unrecognizable. To become so intertwined that archaeologists will argue about where you end and I begin.\n\nThe ring is in my sock drawer, wrapped in the receipt from our first dinner when you ordered three desserts and no main course. It's been there for sixty-seven days. I count them like a rosary, each day a bead of wanting to ask but waiting for the perfect words.\n\nThese aren't them. Perfect words don't exist for this. But imperfect words, trembling words, words that trip over themselves rushing toward you\u2014maybe those are the only ones worth saying.\n\nLeyi, my love, my ghost-whisperer, my collector of broken beautiful things: Will you marry me? Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me\u2014relocated me entirely\u2014into a country where your yes is the only citizenship I want.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am so utterly, ridiculously, molecularly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald says yes too.

Because I can't sleep when something this important needs saying.\n\nTwenty-three drafts sit in my trash. Here's attempt twenty-four.\n\nThe truth: I practiced this with my therapist. She asked why I needed practice to tell someone I love them. I said because \"I love you\" is insufficient data. It's what people say to their dogs, their coffee, their favorite songs. What I feel for you requires more precise documentation.\n\nSo here's the data:\n\nWhen you sleep, you hold your breath for three seconds between inhales. I've timed it. Those three seconds are the longest part of my day.\n\nYou've been saving the same fortune cookie fortune in your wallet for three years. It says \"Your patience will be rewarded.\" You think I don't know. I know.\n\nThat Tuesday you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you weren't really crying about butterflies. Your period was late. You thought you might be pregnant. You weren't ready. Neither was I. When it came, we both pretended nothing happened. But something did happen: I realized I wanted to not be ready with you. I wanted all the terrifying possibilities of us.\n\nYou eat bananas only when they have exactly four brown spots. You rename yourself in coffee shops\u2014so far: Artemis, Dolores, Biscuit. You can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. You apologize to furniture. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times. Forty-three. I counted the tally marks in your copy.\n\nMy father died when I was twelve. I've never told anyone this: the last thing he said wasn't profound. He asked for grape juice. The hospital didn't have any. For twenty years, I've carried the weight of not finding grape juice. You couldn't have known this, but last month, when I had the flu, you brought me grape juice. Unprompted. \"It's what sick people drink,\" you said. I went to the bathroom and sobbed. You gave me something I didn't know I needed to give.\n\nI'm scared of seventeen specific things. You're none of them. Actually, that's a lie. You're all of them, renamed. I'm not scared of heights\u2014I'm scared of falling from the height of loving you. I'm not scared of the dark\u2014I'm scared of the dark without you. See? You've reprogrammed my entire fear taxonomy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: I want to watch you become whoever you're becoming. I want to see you at thirty-five, forty-two, seventy-one. I want to watch your face collect lines from every time you've squinted at books in bad light. I want to be there when you realize your mother was right about something you fought about for decades. I want to hold your hand when the last of your grandparents dies and you become the older generation.\n\nI'm not a poet. I write code. In code, there's something called an infinite loop\u2014when a program keeps running the same sequence forever. That's what you are to me. Not the bug kind that crashes systems. The feature kind. The kind programmers build on purpose because some processes should never terminate.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in God. I said I didn't know. That was a lie. I do. God is the statistical impossibility of you existing at the exact same time as me, in the exact same city, visiting the exact same bookstore, at the exact same moment. God is whatever made you walk in when you did.\n\nI could tell you about the ring. How it belonged to my grandmother who wore it for sixty-three years. How she gave it to me on her deathbed and said \"Don't waste this on someone you can live without.\" How it's been in my sock drawer between my running socks that I never use and my dress socks that I pretend to own. But the ring is just metal and waiting.\n\nWhat matters is this: Tomorrow I will wake up and choose you. The day after, same choice. Repeat until one of us stops breathing. Not because you complete me\u2014I was complete. Because you make me want to be more complete. Because you see the person I'm trying to become and you love him already, which makes me brave enough to keep trying.\n\nYou're going to say this letter is too long. You're right. But I needed you to have all the evidence. Because if you say yes\u2014and God, I hope you say yes\u2014I want you to know exactly what you're saying yes to:\n\nA man who counts your breaths. Who hoards your fortunes. Who would have searched every hospital in the city for grape juice twenty years ago if he'd known it mattered. Who loves you with the kind of specificity that borders on insanity but lands, somehow, on devotion.\n\nMarry me, Leyi. Not the question. The answer to every question you haven't asked yet.\n\nI'll be in the kitchen making your coffee. Two and a half sugars. Never two. Never three.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That spider you named Gerald? He's actually a she. Females have bigger abdomens. I looked it up. I've been calling her Geraldine when you're not home. She seems to prefer it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
