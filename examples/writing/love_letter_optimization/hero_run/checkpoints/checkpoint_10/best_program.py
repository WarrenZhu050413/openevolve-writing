Dear Leyi,

I am writing this at 3:47 AM, unable to sleep because every thought curves back to you like light bending around a star. Not metaphorically—literally. I tried counting sheep and they became the 47 freckles I've memorized across your shoulders.

Do you remember that Tuesday in October when you cried reading about extinct butterflies? You said "even beauty dies" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh—that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised—rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.

I used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce "particularly" as "par-tic-a-larly" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.

Sometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated—because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.

If I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, "This is enough music," and I thought—no, I knew—I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.

I am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.

Marry me, not because I promise you forever—forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.

I am terrified. I am certain. I am yours.

Warren
