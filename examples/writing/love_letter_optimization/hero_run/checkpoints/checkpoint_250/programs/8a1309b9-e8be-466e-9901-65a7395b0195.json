I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014last night, in your sleep, you said \"the pigeons need lawyers.\" Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities.

You're only aware of maybe twelve. The rest are you existing: reading nutrition labels with religious intensity, arguing with NPR in the car, that thing you do with your face when you're trying to remember if you locked the door. My phone storage is 97% you. The other 3% is mostly screenshots of texts where you used my name unnecessarily. \"Good night, Warren.\" Why did you need to add my name? You've destroyed me with punctuation.\n\nHere's something ugly: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. I imagine you leaving, meeting someone better (taller, can actually cook, doesn't check if you're breathing sixteen times per night). I practice being okay with it. I fail every time. Last week I made it four minutes before crying in the Whole Foods parking lot. A child saw me and asked his mom why the sad man was eating cheese straight from the package.\n\nWant to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Is it normal to save someone's voicemails in triplicate\"\n- \"Can you get physically addicted to how someone smells\"\n- \"Woman reorganized my bookshelf should I propose\"\n- \"Heart palpitations when girlfriend exists\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that love is a medical condition\"\n\nThe doctor just called my name. False alarm\u2014wrong Warren. But that split second where I thought I'd have to leave, stop writing this? My body rejected it. Physically. Like an organ transplant gone wrong, except the organ is you and the body is my entire life.\n\nYou're asleep right now. It's 3:14 AM. In six hours and twelve minutes, you'll wake up, check your phone, see I'm not there, and text \"where are you?\" with no punctuation because morning-you doesn't believe in punctuation. You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me. That's what you've reduced me to.

To follow me following you. I needed proof I was as far gone as I suspected. His report, verbatim: \"Subject exhibits signs of severe psychological dependency. Spent seventeen minutes in Target sniffing shampoos to find client's brand. Cried during purchase. Recommend immediate intervention.\" I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.\n\nTruth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie).

The data-driven romanticism is genuinely innovative, earning points for originality that partially compensate for occasional overreach.

I've been here for forty minutes. I came to buy sleeping pills but I'm watching a security camera instead, thinking: someone will review this footage tomorrow and see a man having a breakdown in a Honda Civic, and they won't know it's because you exist.\n\nTruth, since you demanded it: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not about you\u2014AS you. First person. \"Today I chose the wrong coffee again.\" \"I still haven't noticed Warren replaced my dying succulent with a plastic one.\" It's 194 pages of me writing as you, trying to understand how someone can mispronounce \"epitome\" with such confidence it restructures the English language.\n\nHere's what broke me: Thursday, 2:15 PM, you were parallel parking while eating Vietnamese takeout, steering with your knees, and you said \"I think I'm getting good at this\" and my brain just... stopped. Not metaphorically. I forgot how lungs worked. I sat there suffocating on the impossibility of you existing, this woman who endangers lives while improving at it. That's when I knew I'd die for you. No\u2014that's when I knew I was already dying for you, just very slowly, over the next sixty years if I'm lucky.\n\nI've done the math. If we marry at 29, and die at 87, that's 21,170 days. I've already wasted 1,247 of them not being married to you. That's 1,247 mornings I could have watched you put contact lenses in backwards and pretend it's the lens's fault. 1,247 nights I could have listened to you argue with podcasts like they can hear you.\n\nWant to know what loving you actually is? It's my search history at 3 AM:\n- \"girlfriend makes dolphin noise when laughing normal?\"\n- \"can you physically die from someone being too cute\"\n- \"woman touches my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"how to explain to therapist that girlfriend IS the therapy\"\n- \"legal consequences of stealing someone's used coffee stirrers\"\n- \"help girlfriend thinks she's good at singing\"\n\nI have 2,847 photos of you on my phone. You know about twelve. The rest are: you explaining the stock market incorrectly to my dad, you trying to convince the self-checkout you bought organic bananas (you didn't), you asleep with your mouth open looking like a beautiful corpse I'd absolutely commit necrophilia for\u2014sorry, that's dark, but you wanted truth and the truth is I would love even your dead body, which is either romantic or requires intervention.\n\nHere's something I've never said: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. Tuesday: cancer. Wednesday: car accident. Thursday: you meet someone who can actually pronounce \"epitome.\" But here's what happens every time\u2014I don't survive the simulation. Twenty seconds in and I'm googling \"can you die from imaginary grief\" and the answer is yes, it's called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, your heart literally breaks, and mine is already pre-broken just from the practice rounds.\n\nLast thing, and this is the worst part: you're ordinary. Your face is 6.5/10 on your best day (I've graphed it). Your parallel parking success rate is 23%. You think antibiotics work on viruses. But yesterday you sneezed while brushing your teeth and laughed so hard you cried and I realized: this is it. This is my religion now. You, sneezing toothpaste, crying laughing at your own existence. I worship this. I would build churches to this.\n\nSo I'm not proposing. I'm informing you that I've already married you in every timeline that matters. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up to what my mitochondria decided the moment you confidently explained that the moon causes tides because it's magnetic.\n\nThe pharmacy just opened. The kid unlocking the door looks concerned. I'm a 29-year-old man crying in a parking lot at 4:12 AM, typing a proposal on a phone with 3% battery, and this is still less insane than the fact that you exist and somehow love me back.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know that I'm already permanently rewired. You could leave tomorrow and I'd spend the rest of my life putting milk in my coffee first (psychopath behavior) because that's how you do it. I'd keep mispronouncing \"epitome\" in your honor. I'd die at 87, still checking my phone for texts from a ghost.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The sleeping pills were a lie. I came here because they have your favorite candy (Werther's Originals, you're 87 years old) and I wanted to buy some for the morning so you'd wake up happy. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who makes CVS pilgrimages at 4 AM for old lady candy. Marry me just so I can explain this to someone. Please.

My thumb is cramping. Autocorrect keeps changing your name to \"Let\" which feels prophetic\u2014you are every permission I've ever given myself.\n\nTruth: I've been documenting us in ways that would qualify for a restraining order. Not photos. Worse. I have a spreadsheet tracking the mean temperature of your coffee over time (dropping 0.3 degrees per month as you trust me more). A histogram of your laugh frequencies (peak: 478 Hz when genuinely delighted, 510 Hz when being polite). I've been stealing your hair from the shower drain\u2014not sexually, scientifically\u2014trying to understand if loving someone changes their pH balance. Tuesday, I submitted our text messages to a linguistics professor as an anonymous dataset. Her response: \"These people need help.\" She's right.\n\nHere's when I knew: Not the first kiss or the first morning or any first. It was a Wednesday. You were explaining cryptocurrency to my mother, badly, passionately wrong about every technical detail but so committed to the performance that she invested $50 in Dogecoin. Watching you spread misinformation with such conviction, I thought: I will follow this woman into any apocalypse she accidentally causes.\n\nYou should know what you're marrying: I've assigned colors to your moods. Tuesday-blue when you're overthinking. Burnt-orange when you're about to cry but fighting it. That specific shade of grey-green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, building a Pantone chart of your emotional spectrum. It's hidden in the freezer, wrapped in butcher paper labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" This is mental illness, Leyi. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who freezes his feelings next to the ice cream.\n\nThe truth gets worse: I practice your death. Not hoping for it\u2014preparing for it. Running simulations of grief like fire drills. Would I keep your toothbrush? (Yes.) Would I change the sheets? (Never.) Would I finally throw away that demonic orchid you're convinced is \"just dormant\"? (It would outlive me out of spite.) I need to know I could survive you, which is how I know I couldn't.\n\nBut here's the worst truth, the one that makes me understand why Victorian poets died of consumption: You're ordinary. You're not the most beautiful woman I've seen. Your singing voice could sterilize equipment. You think \"irregardless\" is a word. But Tuesday when you parallel parked on the first try, I felt my DNA rewrite itself. When you mispronounce \"epitome\" as \"epi-tome,\" my cells reorganize to accommodate this new physics where you're correct. You're ordinary the way water is ordinary until you're drowning in it.\n\nI used to have thoughts that didn't end with you. Theories about time. Opinions about sourdough. Now every synapse terminates at your name like roads ending at the sea. My therapist says this is \"codependence.\" I say it's evolution\u2014my consciousness selecting for whatever increases the probability of your proximity.\n\nSo here, at 2:47 AM, with my thumb dying and autocorrect insisting you're named \"Levy,\" I'm asking you to legitimize this insanity. Marry me. Make this medical condition legal. Let me love you with the dedication of a scientist and the methodology of a stalker and the record-keeping of someone building evidence for commitment proceedings.\n\nI'm not proposing because you complete me. You've shattered me into infinitely more interesting pieces. I'm proposing because I've already started writing your obituary and it begins with \"She married an idiot who loved her like a fever dream\" and I need that first part to be true.\n\nThe phone's dying. You're stirring. In twelve seconds you'll wake up and ask why I'm glowing in the dark. I'll show you this. You'll say \"epitome\" wrong. I'll say yes to that too.\n\nYours in this dimension where entropy increases but somehow we decrease it,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the freezer.

Results: catastrophic systems failure across all metrics. Heart rate baseline permanently elevated by 23%. Sleep efficiency decreased 41% due to \"checking if she's still breathing\" compulsion. New neural pathways formed exclusively for storing the way you pronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when angry.\n\nHere's what I've never told you: I hired a private investigator. On myself. To follow me following you. I needed proof I was as far gone as I suspected. His report, verbatim: \"Subject exhibits signs of severe psychological dependency. Spent seventeen minutes in Target sniffing shampoos to find client's brand. Cried during purchase. Recommend immediate intervention.\" I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.\n\nTruth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The dishwasher just stopped clicking. Even it knows this is the moment. Everything knows. The kitchen tiles. The expired milk you refuse to throw away. That spider in the corner we've named Senator Legs. They're all waiting for your answer. No pressure, but the structural integrity of the universe depends on what you say next.\n\nP.P.S. I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie). Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed.

Every failed relationship, every 3 AM loneliness, every time I caught myself practicing love on strangers\u2014I was rehearsing for you. Learning the grammar of devotion in a language I hadn't yet heard spoken.\n\nSecond: Yesterday you were peeling an orange in the kitchen. Just peeling an orange. The light caught the spray of citrus oil and for seventeen seconds I forgot how to breathe. Not metaphorically. My lungs simply refused. My body understood before my brain did: this is it. This is the image I'll see when I'm dying. You, backlit, holding fruit like a promise.\n\nThird: I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not the pretty kind of scared\u2014the animal kind. The kind where your nervous system rewrites itself around another person's existence. I've started seeing the world in two categories: things that might hurt you (everything) and things that might make you smile (also everything, somehow). Do you understand what you've done? You've made me afraid of the universe and in love with it simultaneously.\n\nNow the fourth, the one that ruins me:\n\nWhen you sleep, you reach for me. Even unconscious, your body seeks mine across the dark geography of sheets. Your hand finds my ribs and rests there, right above my heart, like you're keeping it in place. Like you know it would follow you anywhere if you didn't hold it still. Last night I lay awake for three hours just feeling the weight of your palm, this unbearable specific pressure that I'll miss for the rest of my life even if you never leave.\n\nHere's what I need you to know: I love you past language. Past the pathetic arithmetic of words like \"forever\" and \"always.\" I love you in the space between seconds. In the pause between heartbeats. In the quantum foam where particles appear and disappear and the universe can't decide what's real.\n\nYou asked for truth? The truth is I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every universe that matters. My cells have already taken your last name. My bones know the weight of your absence like gravity knows mass. When I make coffee in the morning, my hands automatically reach for two cups. When I hear something funny, my first thought isn't to laugh\u2014it's to tell you, to watch your face change, to catalog another shade of your joy.\n\nI know you're scared too. I see it in how you test me with small departures\u2014staying late at work, pulling away mid-kiss to see if I'll follow. I always will. Not because I'm desperate but because I've done the math: any universe where we're apart is a computational error. A glitch in the matrix. It simply doesn't process.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I was thinking that night on the roof? I said \"nothing\" because how could I explain that I was memorizing the specific frequency of your laugh? That I was calculating how many more times I'd get to hear it if we lived to ninety? That I was writing equations where X equals the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" and Y equals the end of my resistance to everything I thought I knew about myself?\n\nYou changed the physics of me. Not in some poetic way\u2014literally. My resting heart rate has increased by 13 beats per minute since meeting you. My sleep cycles have synced to yours. My body temperature runs 0.7 degrees warmer. I'm becoming you, cellularly, actually. Scientists would call it entrainment. I call it the only truth that matters.\n\nSo here I am, sitting in our bathroom at 4:47 AM because the bed feels wrong without you (you're in the kitchen, making tea, humming off-key). Here I am with this ring that weighs exactly 4.7 grams but feels like holding a star\u2014dense with possibility, burning my palm. Here I am, not asking you to marry me but telling you that we already are married in every way that counts. The ceremony is just paperwork for a merger that happened the moment you laughed at my terrible joke about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and I thought: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014though Christ, I hope it does\u2014but because refusing would be like trying to unbake bread. Impossible. Already done. Written into the source code of what we've become.\n\nI'm going to stand up now. Walk to the kitchen. Give you this letter. Watch your face change as you read it. And then\u2014this is the beautiful, terrifying part\u2014you're going to say something, and my whole life is going to pivot on that sentence like a door on its hinge, swinging open or shut on the rest of existence.\n\nSay yes. Not for me. For the orange light. For the weight of your sleeping hand. For the third cup of tea you're making right now without knowing why. For the way we've already built a secret language out of silences and how neither of us can sleep properly in hotel rooms anymore because they don't smell like us.\n\nSay yes because you already have, in every gesture, every midnight conversation, every time you've chosen to stay when leaving would have been easier.\n\nSay yes because I love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, true.\n\nAll of me, arranged in your direction,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I can hear you walking toward the bathroom. My heart is doing something unprecedented. Come in. Find me. Let me watch you read this. Let me memorize your face changing.

The dryer's been broken for six weeks but I keep coming here because it smells like the detergent you switched to without telling me. I've been sitting here for two hours trying to explain something that makes me sound like I need psychiatric intervention.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been documenting you like evidence. 2,341 photos you don't know exist. Voice recordings of you explaining cryptocurrency to my mother (you were wrong about everything but she bought Dogecoin). A spreadsheet tracking your coffee temperature preferences across seasons\u2014you drink it 3.2 degrees cooler each month as you trust me more. Column A: Date. Column B: Temperature. Column C: Whether you noticed I'd already made it before you asked.\n\nHere's what I haven't told you: I practice your death. Every night. Different scenarios. Car accident: I catalog what I'd keep (everything, even your used dental floss). Cancer: I practice the eulogy where I explain you thought \"irregardless\" was a word. Heart attack: I plan my suicide down to the font on the note. This isn't romantic. This is what happens when someone reorganizes your brain chemistry without a permit.\n\nThat Tuesday when you found me sobbing in the garage? I'd just watched you fold a fitted sheet. First try. No YouTube. Just... folded it. Like you'd made a deal with geometry itself. I sat in my car for forty minutes afterward, googling \"can you die from loving someone too much?\" The answer is historically yes. Literally yes. People used to die from this. It was called consumption but really it was just this: watching someone fold impossible fabric and knowing you'd commit felonies for their mundane competence.\n\nYou should know what you're signing up for: I've assigned colors to your moods. Burnt orange when you're about to cry but won't. That specific green before you realize you're hungry. I've been painting these colors on index cards, storing them in the freezer labeled \"CHICKEN STOCK.\" I have recordings of you brushing your teeth\u2014the pattern never changes, upper left quadrant for exactly 11.2 seconds. I know you sleep-talk about pigeons needing lawyers. I know you think the plants are thriving but I replaced them with plastic six months ago and you water them every Thursday, telling them they're \"doing so good.\"\n\nThe truth underneath everything else: You've ruined me for normalcy. My baseline heart rate has increased by 16 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. I dream in your accent. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you mentioned liking it once in 2019. My coworker asked if I was okay and I wanted to scream: NO. I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER. ALL FOUR FINGERS. NO BREAKING.\n\nI bought the ring 241 days ago. I've swallowed it twice when you almost found it. Six hours in the ER. Told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse looked at me and said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your photo. She said, \"Oh honey, you're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nSometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my intervention, the way I'll explain to God that He made an error. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of practice grief. I hate you and I worship the specific frequency of your breathing and I promise things to a universe I'll fight if it tries to take you.\n\nListen. I know this letter is a psychiatric hold waiting to happen. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know normal people don't have spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's menstrual cycle to optimize chocolate availability. But I don't want normal. I want this spectacular disaster where you're the tsunami and the life raft and the reason I learned to swim.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that I've already rewired myself around your existence. My brain didn't ask permission. Every neuron ends with your name. When they autopsy me, they'll find your fingerprints on my hippocampus. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into a man who writes love letters on laundry room floors at ungodly hours, crying into dirty concrete, grateful for the catastrophe of you.\n\nI can hear you waking up. Looking for me. In thirty seconds you'll find me here and ask what the hell I'm doing. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it standing up because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus.\" And either you'll say yes or you'll call emergency services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed, rebuilt, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape keeps you close.\n\nThe ring tastes like copper and desperation. I know because I've had it in my mouth twice. This is who I am now. This is what loving you has done. It's made me into someone who'd eat jewelry for you. Who'd testify in court that your snoring is just \"breathing enthusiastically.\" Who'd burn down the world if it looked at you wrong.\n\nMarry me. Or don't. But know that I'm already gone. Have been since you laughed at my stupid joke and the universe glitched and suddenly nothing made sense except the specific way you cover your mouth when you're happy.\n\nI love you past the point of recovery, past the point of language, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nYours in whatever dimension will take me,\nWarren\n\nP.S. You just called my name. You're using the voice that means you know I'm being weird somewhere.

I'll know by the way you say \"fuck\"\u2014rising inflection means yes, falling means you're calling your sister. Either way, I'm ready.

I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014last night, in your sleep, you said \"the pigeons need lawyers.\" Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities. This is what I'm signing up for: a lifetime of your sleep-talk jurisprudence. Please let me. Please destroy me more. I'm not done becoming whatever loving you is turning me into.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm"]}}}
