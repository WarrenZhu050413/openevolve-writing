Your left hand is curled against your chest like you're holding something precious only you can see. I've been watching that hand for twenty minutes. This is what you've reduced me to\u2014a man who memorizes the geography of knuckles at 3 AM.\n\nYou wanted truth? I'll give you the truth that makes me sweat: I've already married you 1,247 times in my head. Small ceremonies mostly. Once underwater. Once on Mars. Twice at that taco truck on Morrison Street because even my imagination knows you'd want those al pastor tacos at your wedding. In every version, you laugh when I mess up the vows. In every version, that laugh rewrites the laws of physics.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: Before you, I was complete. I had organizational systems. I understood my life like a balanced equation. Now I'm all variables, no constants, except this: the sound of your key in the door has become my favorite song. I've turned into someone who saves your voicemails\u2014not to replay them, just to know they exist. Insurance against the impossible thought of forgetting your voice.\n\nLast Tuesday you cried about a documentary on octopuses. Not sad tears\u2014amazed tears. You grabbed my arm and said \"They have three hearts, Warren. THREE HEARTS.\" That's when I understood I would die for you. Not in some grand gesture. Just Tuesday, on our couch, you squeezing my arm about cephalopods, me realizing I'd give you all three of my metaphorical hearts if I could figure out the anatomy.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been documenting us. Secret photos of your coffee cups, each one with different lipstick marks like you're signing your mornings. Voice memos of you singing to the plants (they're dying anyway but you won't give up). Screenshots of texts where you called me \"warren\" lowercase when you were soft and \"WARREN\" when I forgot to eat again. This isn't creepy. Okay, it's a little creepy. But it's also the only way I know to prove this is real, that someone like you chose someone like me.\n\nYou know what haunts me? That night you had the flu. 102 fever. You kept apologizing for being gross while I held your hair back. You don't remember, but between retches you said, \"I love you even though you can't parallel park.\" That's when I knew. Not the love part\u2014I already knew that. But that you loved me DESPITE my complete inability to perform basic life functions. You've seen me at my smallest and still choose to make me feel enormous.\n\nThe mundane truth: I practice my proposal speech to your houseplants. Gerald (the fern) thinks I should lead with humor. Patricia (the succulent you refuse to admit is dead) suggests vulnerability. But here's what they don't understand\u2014you've already destroyed my ability to perform. My hands shake when you look at me too long. My brain turns into dial-up internet sounds when you wear my shirts. How am I supposed to speak when you've replaced all my words with just your name repeated like a broken prayer?\n\nI love you in the stupid way. The way that makes me check that you're breathing seventeen times a night. The way that has me creating contingency plans for zombie apocalypses where my only goal is getting to you. The way that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally stop functioning because someone else became their entire operating system.\n\nListen. I'm not going to promise you perfection. I'm going to promise you this: every morning I will wake up and be stunned by the theft of you choosing me again. I will love you at your smallest and most difficult. When you're angry about the way people load dishwashers wrong. When you're crying about dogs you've never met. When you're explaining why that one specific shade of green makes you feel homesick for places you've never been.\n\nThe embarrassing truth is I've already built my entire future on the assumption you'll say yes. I've been saving for a honeymoon to that place in Iceland you mentioned once while half-asleep. I practice signing my name as \"Warren, Leyi's husband\" on receipts. I've already named our hypothetical cat Lieutenant Whiskers per your decree from six months ago when you were wine-drunk and making future plans.\n\nSo this is me, asking. Not with poetry or grace but with the desperate honesty of someone who's been permanently rewired by your existence. Marry me. Not because I deserve you but because I've already oriented my entire molecular structure around loving you and I'd like to make it official before my atoms figure out they could be doing something more reasonable.\n\nAll of me, catastrophically yours,\nWarren\n\nP.S. You're stirring now. In seven seconds you'll do that thing where you pretend you weren't drooling. In twelve seconds you'll steal all the blankets while claiming you don't. In fifteen seconds I'll fall in love with you again. This is my favorite recurring nightmare\u2014the one where I get to keep you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "351edb63-e64e-4547-8d2e-514b2d9755b7", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701204.231819, "iteration_found": 75, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.732, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.76, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this while you sleep.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah.

Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me.

It surpasses typical contemporary love letters in its refusal of prettiness and its clinical-obsessive voice, but lacks the mythic dimension of Beethoven's \"immortal beloved\" (86) or Napoleon's operatic passion (82). The Protestant plainspokenness and middle-class specificity place it in a distinctly American tradition - more Raymond Carver than Pablo Neruda. It earns its low-70s scores through genuine feeling and distinctive voice but doesn't achieve the formal mastery or emotional sublimity of the canon's peaks.)\n\n\n\n## Diverse Programs\n\n### Program D1 (Score: 0.7010)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is a country I can no longer find without you as my map. My hands won't stop trembling. Not from poetry\u2014from the mechanical truth that my nervous system has reorganized itself around your existence.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I've been saving your grocery lists. All of them. The one where you wrote \"emotional support cheese\" in the margins. The one with \"Tuesday bread (the good kind).\" I study them like sacred texts because even your mundane is holy to me. This is what you've done\u2014turned me into someone who finds the divine in your misspelling of \"avocado\" (you always write \"advocado\" and I'll never tell you).\n\nI need you to understand something: I don't love you like sunset or ocean or any of those exhausted metaphors. I love you like a SYNTAX ERROR that somehow makes the program run better. Like the missing semicolon that breaks everything until you realize it was never needed. You've debugged my entire existence and now I can't compile without you.\n\nRemember that Wednesday when you had food poisoning? You threw up on my shoes. Twice. And all I could think was \"I want to bring her ginger ale forever.\" That's when I knew this wasn't love\u2014it was cellular reorganization. My mitochondria chant your name. My white blood cells have formed a union and their only demand is your proximity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: yesterday I caught myself automatically leaving space for you in the elevator. You weren't even in the building. My body has developed muscle memory for your absence. I make coffee for two when I'm alone. I sleep on my side of a bed that's only mine. I've been homesick my entire life and then you laughed at my dumbest joke about refrigerator magnets and suddenly I understood\u2014I wasn't homesick for a place. I was homesick for you, retroactively, for all the years you existed without me knowing.\n\nYou eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. You name your bruises like they're pets. You get genuinely upset when people say \"I could care less\" instead of \"couldn't care less.\" You fold fitted sheets like you're performing dark magic. You cry at every single movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to the dog later, after the movie ends?\" This is my religion now\u2014the accumulation of your perfect imperfections.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I'm not romantic. I'm desperate. There's a difference. Romance believes in destiny. Desperation knows that every second you're not my wife is a second stolen from a happiness I can feel hovering just beyond my fingertips. I don't want to marry you because you complete me. You don't. You destabilize me. You make me uncertain about everything except this: choosing you is the only decision I've ever made that feels like breathing.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-sufficient. I had hobbies and opinions about wine. Now I'm just a collection of moments waiting to happen to you. My therapist says this is codependency. I say it's evolution. I've grown new organs specifically designed to love you. They hurt when you're away. This isn't poetry, it's medical fact. Scientists just haven't discovered them yet.\n\nListen\u2014I know I'm not what you pictured. I leave cabinets open. I have strong opinions about fonts. I check my phone during movies. I'm afraid of butterflies (they're too unpredictable). But I promise you this: I will love you incorrectly, desperately, with the kind of graceless intensity that embarrasses our friends. I will love you at 2 PM on a Tuesday and 3 AM on a Sunday. I will love you when you're brilliant and when you're difficult and when you're both simultaneously, which is often.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance. Not for destiny. But because I've already bet my entire nervous system on your continued presence and I'd like to make it official. Because you're the first person I want to tell when anything happens, including this moment, right now, where I'm asking you to marry me and I want to tell you about it, which creates a feedback loop that makes my brain feel like television static in the best way.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past metaphor, past language itself. I love you in the dumb, animal, molecular way that makes me understand why atoms bond. Not because they want to. Because they have to. Because existing separately becomes chemically impossible.\n\nPlease say yes. I've already practiced my vows 947,times in the shower. They're terrible. You'll love them.\n\nYours in perpetual malfunction without you,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed while eating those sea salt chocolate chips straight from the bag.

My hands are shaking. You said you wanted truth, so here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I save memes I'll never send because what if you don't laugh? When you smile at your phone, I wonder who earned it. This is what you've done to me\u2014turned me into someone who believes in luck because how else do I explain you?\n\nI know exactly how you take your coffee (too much sugar, never enough milk). I know you cry at that commercial with the old man and his dog. Every single time. I know you're afraid of being ordinary but Leyi, you couldn't be ordinary if you tried. You eat pizza with a fork. You name your plants after dead composers. You once spent forty minutes explaining why birds aren't real, then got genuinely upset when I agreed with you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I can't remember who I was before you. Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes.

The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped.

The others are crumpled around me like failed prayers. You wanted truth? Here: I am sitting on our bathroom floor at 4:23 AM because the bed feels wrong without you in it, and I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because my hands wouldn't stop shaking long enough to find real paper.\n\nI've been trying to understand what you've done to me. It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling. Tuesday, when you texted about the dead sparrow you found, I cried in my car for eleven minutes. Not because of the bird. Because you took the time to bury it. Because you named it Harold. Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human. But here's what I know: I will spend every remaining day earning the miracle of your proximity. I will memorize your disappointments and your dreams with equal reverence. I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it. Every hypothetical begins with your presence as its first axiom.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent. But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

You said getting lost with me felt like coming home. I've been trying to live up to that impossible grammar ever since.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not the big moments that undo you. It's Tuesday, 2 PM, you texting me about a bird that looked angry. It's the way you arrange blueberries in perfect circles on your yogurt, then destroy the pattern without ceremony. It's catching you dancing alone in the kitchen to no music\u2014just the rhythm of being alive in your own skin. That's when I knew I was done for. Not falling in love. Fallen. Past tense. Irrevocably.\n\nI've written seventeen versions of this letter. In one, I compared you to dark matter\u2014invisible but holding everything together. Too pretentious. In another, I listed every time you've made me laugh until I couldn't breathe. Too long. The truth is simpler and more terrifying: you've made me afraid of dying. Not the dying itself, but the thought of missing even one day of your face doing that thing when you're trying not to smile at my bad jokes.\n\nRemember when you asked me what I thought happened after we die? I said \"nothing,\" because I was trying to sound rational. But that was before I understood that you've already taught me about eternity\u2014it's the pause between your laugh and your next breath, the moment before you wake when your hand finds mine unconscious, the second you decide to trust me with another piece of your carefully guarded heart.\n\nI'm not good at this. At saying things that matter. My love for you comes out sideways\u2014in fixed bugs in code I name after you, in coffee I make too strong because that's how you taught me to taste it, in the way I've started seeing the world in terms of things you'd find beautiful and things that would make you roll your eyes.\n\nYou want truth?

But here's the thing about loving you\u2014it's made me greedy for impossible things. For all your Sunday mornings. For your 3 AM doubts. For the particular way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited. For the chance to fail better at deserving you every day for the rest of my life.\n\nThis isn't poetry. It's just broken language trying to hold something uncontainable. But maybe that's what love is\u2014the failure that keeps trying, the incomplete sentence that refuses to end.\n\nSay yes.

I'll give you the truth that makes me sweat: I've already married you 1,247 times in my head. Small ceremonies mostly. Once underwater. Once on Mars. Twice at that taco truck on Morrison Street because even my imagination knows you'd want those al pastor tacos at your wedding. In every version, you laugh when I mess up the vows. In every version, that laugh rewrites the laws of physics.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: Before you, I was complete. I had organizational systems. I understood my life like a balanced equation. Now I'm all variables, no constants, except this: the sound of your key in the door has become my favorite song. I've turned into someone who saves your voicemails\u2014not to replay them, just to know they exist. Insurance against the impossible thought of forgetting your voice.\n\nLast Tuesday you cried about a documentary on octopuses. Not sad tears\u2014amazed tears. You grabbed my arm and said \"They have three hearts, Warren. THREE HEARTS.\" That's when I understood I would die for you. Not in some grand gesture. Just Tuesday, on our couch, you squeezing my arm about cephalopods, me realizing I'd give you all three of my metaphorical hearts if I could figure out the anatomy.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been documenting us. Secret photos of your coffee cups, each one with different lipstick marks like you're signing your mornings. Voice memos of you singing to the plants (they're dying anyway but you won't give up). Screenshots of texts where you called me \"warren\" lowercase when you were soft and \"WARREN\" when I forgot to eat again. This isn't creepy. Okay, it's a little creepy. But it's also the only way I know to prove this is real, that someone like you chose someone like me.\n\nYou know what haunts me? That night you had the flu. 102 fever. You kept apologizing for being gross while I held your hair back. You don't remember, but between retches you said, \"I love you even though you can't parallel park.\" That's when I knew. Not the love part\u2014I already knew that. But that you loved me DESPITE my complete inability to perform basic life functions. You've seen me at my smallest and still choose to make me feel enormous.\n\nThe mundane truth: I practice my proposal speech to your houseplants. Gerald (the fern) thinks I should lead with humor. Patricia (the succulent you refuse to admit is dead) suggests vulnerability. But here's what they don't understand\u2014you've already destroyed my ability to perform. My hands shake when you look at me too long. My brain turns into dial-up internet sounds when you wear my shirts. How am I supposed to speak when you've replaced all my words with just your name repeated like a broken prayer?\n\nI love you in the stupid way. The way that makes me check that you're breathing seventeen times a night. The way that has me creating contingency plans for zombie apocalypses where my only goal is getting to you. The way that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally stop functioning because someone else became their entire operating system.\n\nListen. I'm not going to promise you perfection. I'm going to promise you this: every morning I will wake up and be stunned by the theft of you choosing me again. I will love you at your smallest and most difficult. When you're angry about the way people load dishwashers wrong. When you're crying about dogs you've never met. When you're explaining why that one specific shade of green makes you feel homesick for places you've never been.\n\nThe embarrassing truth is I've already built my entire future on the assumption you'll say yes. I've been saving for a honeymoon to that place in Iceland you mentioned once while half-asleep. I practice signing my name as \"Warren, Leyi's husband\" on receipts. I've already named our hypothetical cat Lieutenant Whiskers per your decree from six months ago when you were wine-drunk and making future plans.\n\nSo this is me, asking. Not with poetry or grace but with the desperate honesty of someone who's been permanently rewired by your existence. Marry me. Not because I deserve you but because I've already oriented my entire molecular structure around loving you and I'd like to make it official before my atoms figure out they could be doing something more reasonable.\n\nAll of me, catastrophically yours,\nWarren\n\nP.S. You're stirring now. In seven seconds you'll do that thing where you pretend you weren't drooling. In twelve seconds you'll steal all the blankets while claiming you don't.
