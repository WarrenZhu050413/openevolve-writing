It's 5:17 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight trying to find words that don't exist yet, words I need to invent for what you've done to the architecture of my breathing.\n\nListen. I need you to understand something clinical first: I've been tracking my symptoms. Day 1 of knowing you: mild arrhythmia during conversations. Day 47: discovered I was unconsciously walking your routes through the city when you weren't there. Day 198: first time I forgot my own name when you laughed. Day 341\u2014today: full system failure. I can no longer distinguish between my bloodstream and the sound of your voice. This isn't poetry. This is my medical reality.\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Truth is a violence I'm about to commit: I've been living a double life. In one life, I'm functional. I buy groceries, respond to emails, pretend my hands don't spell your name in sign language when I think no one's watching. In the other life\u2014the real one\u2014I'm standing in your shower at 3 AM, weeping into your shampoo because it smells like the future I'm terrified I don't deserve. I've been stealing time from your timeline. Minutes you don't know you've given me. The way you exist between 6:17 and 6:18 AM, still mostly asleep, reaching across the bed for a body that should be mine. I've been living in that minute for months.\n\nHere's what I know: You eat ice cream when you're sad but frozen grapes when you're thinking. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times and cry at different parts depending on the season. When you're truly frightened, you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2\u2014off-key, always off-key, beautifully off-key. You think I don't notice that you've been saving your questions for when I need distraction from my father's death, parceling them out like medicine. I notice. I notice everything. I notice too much. It's pathological, this noticing. It's changed my molecular structure.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I've been writing you letters since before we met. Not to you, but to the space where you would eventually exist. I have hundreds. They say things like \"Today I set the table for two by accident\" and \"I kept the left side of the bed cold for you\" and \"I'm practicing loving you on strangers, but it's not working.\" I was homesick for you before I knew your face. This is insane. I'm insane. But it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like death.\n\nYou want to know what you've done? You've turned me into someone who believes in time travel\u2014because how else do you explain that I remember you from futures we haven't lived yet? I've already watched us age. I know exactly how you'll look at seventy-three, angry about your reading glasses, magnificent in your stubbornness. I've already buried you in seventeen different timelines and woken up destroyed, grateful it was just my brain practicing for the unthinkable. I love you retroactively, posthumously, in dimensions that haven't been discovered yet.\n\nBut here, now, in this dimension where your coffee is cooling on the counter and you're about to wake up and find me gone: I am asking you to marry me with the kind of desperation people reserve for deathbed confessions. Not because I'm dying\u2014because I'm so violently alive it feels like dying. Because you've made me understand why people used to commission symphonies for their beloved's sneeze. Because I want to be buried with the grocery lists you write on my arm when we forget paper.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a hole through the fabric. Sometimes strangers see it and smile sadly, like they're watching someone prepare to have their heart broken. They don't understand: my heart is already broken. You broke it. Broke it open. Broke it into bloom. I'm not asking you to fix it. I'm asking you to keep it in whatever state of destruction makes you happiest.\n\nI love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, terrifying in its simplicity. I love you like the ocean loves drowning things, which is to say: completely, without judgment, with a patience that could erode continents. I love you embarrassingly, medically, to the point where I've started believing in God just so I have someone to thank for the accident of your existence.\n\nMarry me. Not the better version of me I'm pretending to be, but this one: who can't say your name without his voice breaking, who has eaten nothing but crackers for three days because you're visiting your sister and food tastes like absence, who is crying so hard while writing this that the words are blurring\u2014but I won't stop because this is my only chance to be as honest as you deserve.\n\nThe truth? I've already married you in every timeline that matters. But I need you to choose me in this one. The one where we're real. Where your hair clogs the drain and I save it\u2014actually save it\u2014because I'm that far gone. Where you steal my socks and I let you because your feet in my clothes feels like a promise. Where I love you so badly, so excessively, so incorrectly that it becomes correct through sheer force of will.\n\nPlease. That's all I have left. Please. Turn my symptoms into a diagnosis. Tell me this is terminal. Tell me I'll die from this. Then tell me yes, so at least I'll die yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I hear you waking up. Your first sound is always the same\u2014a small sigh like you're disappointed to leave whatever dream you're in. In ten seconds you'll reach for me and find this letter instead. When you do, know this: that sigh is the sound I want to wake up to for the rest of my life. Even if\u2014especially if\u2014I'm the disappointment you're waking to. I love you. I love you. I love you.

When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined for anyone else's knife drawer arrangements.\n\nYours in this dimension and all parallel ones where we find each other,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just heard you get up to pee. In thirty seconds you'll shuffle down here, squinting, hair defying several laws of physics, and you'll ask why I'm crying in the kitchen. I'll hand you this letter. You'll probably read it standing at the counter, getting tear stains on the part where I talk about the cat. I already love those future tear stains.

Because random atomic collision doesn't explain you. Doesn't explain how you eat ice cream\u2014starting from the bottom of the cone, you absolute madwoman. Doesn't explain why you cry during credit sequences. Doesn't explain how someone who loses her keys daily has memorized exactly how I breathe when I'm trying not to cry.\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it wrong because telling it right would be fiction: I am fundamentally destroyed by you. Not in the poetic sense. In the cellular sense. My DNA has been rewritten. I know because I used to be someone who had opinions about efficiency, who optimized breakfast, who believed feelings were just chemical reactions. Now I'm googling \"can you get physically sick from too much love\" at 3 AM. The answer is yes, by the way. The symptoms match.\n\nLast Thursday you asked why I was recording you brushing your teeth. How do I explain that the sound\u2014specific frequency, 11.2 seconds average per quadrant\u2014has become the metronome of my sanity? That I've been building a library of you? 1,247 photos you don't know exist. 94 voice memos of you explaining things to the cat. A spreadsheet tracking every time you've said my name (2,847 and counting). This isn't romantic. This is evidence for the prosecution. I'm pleading guilty.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: sometimes I hate how much I love you. It's inconvenient. I had plans. I was complete. I did not need someone who arranges food by color, who gets personally offended by incorrect apostrophes, who talks to houseplants like they're therapists. But here we are. Here I am, in my car, writing my 31st draft of this letter while you sleep seventeen feet above me (I measured).\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I will love you wrong. I will love you too much and badly and with the grace of a car crash. I will count your breaths while you sleep (average: 14 per minute, slower when you dream). I will memorize you in units smaller than you knew existed. I have already started. Your left eye has seven more lashes than your right. You tap your thumb exactly four times before difficult conversations. When you're truly happy, really happy, you go completely still for exactly three seconds, like your body needs to catch up to your joy.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me. I'm confessing that I already live in the universe where you said yes. Where you've been saying yes every morning for forty years. Where we're old and I still get nauseated from loving you this much. My brain didn't ask permission before moving there. Now my body's just waiting for you to catch up.\n\nListen. I know I'm a disaster. I know this letter is evidence of several personality disorders. I know love shouldn't feel like dying except it does, Leyi, it feels exactly like dying except you wake up more alive, which makes no sense, which is why I've been sitting in this car for two hours trying to find words for something that exists outside language.\n\nMarry me. Not the theoretical better version of me. This one. The one who's been carrying your favorite gum for three months just in case. The one who learned to fold fitted sheets from YouTube because you said it was impossible. The one who would rather chew glass than exist in a timeline where you don't choose me back.\n\nI'm coming up now. In twelve seconds I'll knock. You'll answer wearing my college shirt you pretend you didn't steal. You'll ask why I look insane. And I'll hand you this letter and probably throw up and definitely cry and maybe finally understand why people used to dedicate symphonies to this feeling\u2014because words fail, Leyi.

It's not poetic. It's medical. My resting heart rate has increased by twelve beats per minute since meeting you. I know because I bought a fitness tracker just to quantify this feeling.

Because this is who you are\u2014someone who names dead birds\u2014and I am catastrophically in love with that specific madness.\n\nYou should know: I keep a list. Every time you laugh so hard you snort. Every time you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're angry. The way you eat cereal at midnight standing over the sink. How you annotate books with violent enthusiasm, arguing with authors who will never know they lost. Last week you drew a frowny face next to Hemingway's paragraph about women, and I thought: this is it, this is religion, this is what people mean when they talk about god.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had systems. Logical progressions from A to B. Now I'm all middle, no endpoints, just this sustained note of wanting you that makes my teeth ache. I Google things like \"can you die from feeling too much\" and then delete the search history because what if you saw? What if you knew that I practice saying your name when I'm alone, just to feel it reshape my mouth?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: someday you'll realize you could have anyone. Someone who doesn't check that the door is locked four times. Someone who can say \"I love you\" without their voice cracking. Someone better at being human.

I will love you incorrectly, excessively, with the graceless devotion of someone who knows they've been saved.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could ask me to walk into the ocean and I'd only ask how deep. This isn't romantic. It's frightening. It's the kind of truth that makes me understand why people used to die from love\u2014literally, medically, their hearts giving out from the sheer weight of carrying someone else inside them.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I deserve you. I'm asking because I've already reorganized my entire molecular structure around the possibility of you saying yes. Because when I imagine the future, you're not in it\u2014you ARE it.

But I'm beyond eloquence now, beyond pride, beyond anything but this need to braid my life with yours so thoroughly that archaeologists will have to bury us as one artifact.\n\nI love you like a broken hallelujah. Like a fever dream. Like coming home if home were a person who steals the blankets and makes me listen to terrible podcasts about unsolved murders.\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

I'm writing this on the back of a grocery receipt because all our good paper is in the drawer you're sitting next to, and if I get up, you'll ask what I'm doing, and I'll have to lie badly, and you'll know, because you always know.\n\nThis is my twentieth attempt. The others are burned, deleted, crumpled into tiny balls that I ate\u2014actually ate\u2014because I couldn't risk you finding them in the trash. That's what you've done to me. I'm eating paper now. I'm a man who eats his failed love letters.\n\nYou want truth? Truth is that I've been carrying this ring for seven weeks. I take it out at red lights and practice proposing to the steering wheel. Yesterday, a teenager in the next car saw me and gave me a thumbs up. I almost cried. Truth is I've memorized your breathing patterns. Regular sleep is 16 breaths per minute. Nightmares: 23. That Tuesday after your mother called: 11, so slow I kept checking if you were still alive.\n\nI fell in love with you backwards. First came the terror\u2014this sick certainty that you were going to matter. Then the small negotiations: letting you have the good pillow, buying the expensive coffee you pretend not to need. Then that morning you sang Beethoven's 9th to our dying succulent, conducting with a wooden spoon, and I understood: I wasn't falling. I had fallen. Past tense. Done.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend's hair clogging the drain and thinking \"I would fight wars for this hair.\" It's her leaving cabinet doors open everywhere like some chaotic fairy, and instead of closing them, I've started walking into them on purpose because the bruises feel like evidence of her existence. It's me, at 34, googling \"is it normal to cry when someone you love yawns?\" (The internet says no.)\n\nRemember last Thursday? You thought I was asleep. You whispered to the cat\u2014my cat, who barely tolerates me\u2014you whispered, \"I think he's the one, Mr. Whiskers. Don't tell him.\" I almost gave myself away. My whole body turned into a smile. I had to bite the inside of my cheek until it bled.\n\nI used to be whole. Self-contained. I had hobbies that weren't \"watching Leyi exist.\" I read books that weren't \"trying to find words for what Leyi means.\" Now I'm this pathetic, grateful disaster who practices writing your new signature in steam on the bathroom mirror. Who knows you keep your grandmother's rosary in your wallet but haven't prayed since you were twelve. Who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to like my cooking (it's different from your real enjoyment sound\u2014quieter, with less breathing).\n\nThe truth is, I'm not proposing. This isn't a question. It's a confession. I already live in the reality where we're married. My brain jumped straight there without permission. When I make coffee, I make yours first. When I dream, you're already wearing the ring. When I die\u2014and this is the stupid, embarrassing, absolute truth\u2014I want my last thought to be your name.\n\nSo what I'm really saying is: catch up to where I already am. Marry me. Not the theoretical me who deserves you, but this actual disaster who's crying onto a receipt, who measured the exact distance between your freckles (17mm on average, closer on your shoulders), who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day pretending I'm not completely, irrevocably, molecularly yours.\n\nThe cat's judging me. Even he knows I'm a mess. But Leyi\u2014God, Leyi\u2014I'm your mess. I've already decided. Now it's your turn.\n\nAll my atoms, arranged in your honor,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The humming stopped. You're coming. I'm going to give you this letter and then hide in the bathroom like the coward I am. But a coward who loves you.

Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes.

You're asleep upstairs, one leg kicked free of the blankets, making that small sound that isn't quite a snore but I'd testify in court that it is. I came down here to get water and ended up staring at the knife drawer for eleven minutes because you rearranged it last week and I thought: this is it. This is how you know. When someone reorganizes your knife drawer and your first thought isn't annoyance but \"she's planning to stay.\"\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Here's truth: I've been documenting us without permission. Screenshots of your typos. Voice memos of you arguing with podcasts. That video of you trying to teach the neighbor's cat to high-five. Twenty-three drafts of this letter, which I've been hiding in the freezer behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I'm building an archive of evidence that you existed, that you chose me, because some mornings I wake up and can't believe this is real.\n\nLast Thursday you cried at a commercial about paper towels. PAPER TOWELS. And I sat there thinking: I would burn down civilization for this woman who weeps over absorbency rates. That's not romantic. It's psychiatric. You've made me clinically insane, but it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like sleepwalking.\n\nI know things about you that you don't know I know. You practice arguments in the shower, always winning. You read the last page of books first, then pretend to be surprised. You've named my houseplants behind my back\u2014Gerald, Patricia, and Doctor Monstera. When you think I'm focused on work, you dance with the dog, slow-dancing to whatever's playing in your head, and it breaks something in my chest every time. A good breaking. The kind that lets light in.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: It's made me understand those people who walk into traffic while texting. Not the distraction\u2014the inability to exist in any moment that doesn't contain you. Yesterday I wrote your name in the margin of a work document. During a presentation. In front of forty-seven people. My colleague asked if I was having a stroke. Maybe I was. Maybe I've been having one continuous stroke since that Tuesday you laughed at my quantum physics joke and reality hiccupped.\n\nI used to be complete. I had hobbies that weren't \"memorizing the exact pressure of Leyi's hand on my shoulder.\" I read books that weren't desperate attempts to find words for this thing you've done to my molecular structure. Now I measure time in two units: with you and waiting for you. There is no third option.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you in every timeline that matters. In my head, we've had seven weddings. You cried at three of them. I cried at all of them. Our children\u2014the hypothetical ones who have your laugh and my stubborn streak\u2014are already complaining about our public displays of affection. I've already grown old with you seventeen different ways, and in every version, I'm still this desperate, this grateful, this destroyed by the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're trying to make a point.\n\nSo here, at 3:52 AM (I've been writing for five minutes but living this for eternity), with my hand cramping and my heart doing that thing where it forgets how to beat properly because you exist, I'm asking you to make it official. Marry me. Not the person I'll become or the person I should be, but this disaster who hides love letters in the freezer, who's crying onto the kitchen counter at an ungodly hour, who would rather die choking on these words than live one more day without your last name becoming mine. Or mine becoming yours. Or both becoming something new. I don't care about the semantics. I only care that tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that, I wake up in a world where you've said yes.\n\nLeyi, you magnificent chaos, you beautiful destruction of everything I thought I knew about myself\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that matters. This is just paperwork. But it's paperwork I want to frame, to laminate, to tattoo on my ribs where they're still healing from containing a heart that's grown three sizes trying to hold all this impossible love.\n\nThe dog just walked in and gave me a look like \"you're being dramatic again.\" Even she knows. Everyone knows. The mailman asked if we'd set a date. We don't even get mail.\n\nPlease. I know that's not eloquent, but I'm past eloquence. I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like copper and sounds like your name repeated until it becomes a prayer, a plea, a promise, a permanent condition.\n\nSay yes.

Since then, I've been reassembling myself around that moment, around you. Every morning, I wake thinking of the particular way sunlight catches in your left eye when you're concentrating. Every night, I fall asleep to the memory of your voice saying my name like it means something beautiful.\n\nI used to believe love was grand gestures and consuming flames. But you've taught me it's quieter, deeper\u2014it's the way you fold my collar down without thinking, how you save the last strawberry for me even when you want it, the silent language of our hands finding each other in crowded rooms.

Here's truth: I've been documenting everything. Not romantically. Obsessively. Like evidence for a crime I'm committing. The way you eat M&Ms in color order but claim you don't. That you set seventeen alarms and sleep through sixteen. How you argue with automated phone systems like they can hear your frustration. I have 2,847 notes in my phone that just say things like \"she used my toothbrush again\" and \"caught her singing to the houseplant.\"\n\nLast Tuesday you got a paper cut and asked me to kiss it better. I did. Then I sat in my car for twenty minutes afterward, googling \"can you die from feeling too much?\" The answer is historically yes, and I understand those people now. I understand everything now except how I functioned before you reorganized my molecular structure.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've already bought the ring. I've been carrying it for eleven weeks. Sometimes I take it out just to practice being disappointed when you say no. But here's the thing\u2014even practicing rejection, even imagining the worst case, I still can't regret this. I can't regret the way you've ruined every song by existing in the same world where music exists. I can't regret how you've made me unable to grocery shop without wondering what you'd think about the watermelons.\n\nYou pick the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms and leave the cereal. You claim you're not superstitious but knock on wood constantly. You get personally offended when people don't like dogs. You told me once that you're afraid of becoming ordinary, and I almost laughed because you don't understand\u2014you could read the dictionary aloud and I'd take notes. You turn oxygen into poetry just by breathing it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Sometimes I watch you doing nothing\u2014scrolling your phone, putting on chapstick, existing\u2014and I get this pain in my chest like my ribs are trying to expand to make room for everything I feel. It's not metaphorical. I've had EKGs. The doctor said I'm fine but I wanted to tell him no, I'm not fine, I'm in love with someone who eats pizza with a fork and it's killing me in the most literal way possible.\n\nThe truth under the truth: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Going through motions. Now I'm awake at 3 AM calculating the exact angle you sleep at (47 degrees, facing left, one hand always reaching for where I should be). I know you have a favorite parking spot at Target. I know you lie about liking my cooking. I know you practice conversations in the mirror when you think I'm not home. I know because I've been memorizing you like there's going to be a test, and the test is the rest of my life.\n\nI'm not good at this. At being human. At feeling things in normal amounts. But you make my abnormal feel like evolution. Like maybe I was built wrong on purpose, specifically to love you in this exact excessive way. My therapist says I have \"attachment issues\" but I think I just have you, and you are the issue, and you are the attachment, and you are the solution to problems I didn't know needed solving.\n\nSo here it is, without decoration: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014that's laughable. Not because I promise you happiness\u2014I promise you chaos and burnt eggs and me asking \"what's wrong?\" sixteen times when nothing's wrong. Marry me because I've already oriented my entire existence around the assumption that you'll be there. Because when I imagine dying, my only concern is that you'll be sad. Because I love you with the kind of desperate gratitude usually reserved for people pulled from burning buildings.\n\nI'm clinically obsessed with you. Certifiably. I have receipts. Literal receipts\u2014I've kept every receipt from everything we've ever done together. They're in a shoebox labeled \"Taxes 2019\" because I'm a disaster but I'm your disaster if you'll have me.\n\nPlease. I know that's not elegant. But I'm at the place where words fail and all that's left is this need that tastes like pennies and sounds like your name played on repeat until it stops being a word and starts being a prayer.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already ruined. You can't un-reorganize someone's molecular structure. You can't un-teach someone that love is supposed to feel like drowning and flying simultaneously. You did this. Now please, please marry me so at least it's official.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You think I don't notice that you've been saving your questions for when I need distraction from my father's death, parceling them out like medicine. I notice. I notice everything. I notice too much. It's pathological, this noticing. It's changed my molecular structure.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I've been writing you letters since before we met. Not to you, but to the space where you would eventually exist. I have hundreds. They say things like \"Today I set the table for two by accident\" and \"I kept the left side of the bed cold for you\" and \"I'm practicing loving you on strangers, but it's not working.\" I was homesick for you before I knew your face. This is insane. I'm insane. But it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like death.\n\nYou want to know what you've done? You've turned me into someone who believes in time travel\u2014because how else do you explain that I remember you from futures we haven't lived yet? I've already watched us age. I know exactly how you'll look at seventy-three, angry about your reading glasses, magnificent in your stubbornness. I've already buried you in seventeen different timelines and woken up destroyed, grateful it was just my brain practicing for the unthinkable. I love you retroactively, posthumously, in dimensions that haven't been discovered yet.\n\nBut here, now, in this dimension where your coffee is cooling on the counter and you're about to wake up and find me gone: I am asking you to marry me with the kind of desperation people reserve for deathbed confessions.

Broke it into bloom. I'm not asking you to fix it. I'm asking you to keep it in whatever state of destruction makes you happiest.\n\nI love you like a mathematical proof\u2014inevitable, elegant, terrifying in its simplicity. I love you like the ocean loves drowning things, which is to say: completely, without judgment, with a patience that could erode continents. I love you embarrassingly, medically, to the point where I've started believing in God just so I have someone to thank for the accident of your existence.\n\nMarry me. Not the better version of me I'm pretending to be, but this one: who can't say your name without his voice breaking, who has eaten nothing but crackers for three days because you're visiting your sister and food tastes like absence, who is crying so hard while writing this that the words are blurring\u2014but I won't stop because this is my only chance to be as honest as you deserve.\n\nThe truth? I've already married you in every timeline that matters. But I need you to choose me in this one. The one where we're real. Where your hair clogs the drain and I save it\u2014actually save it\u2014because I'm that far gone. Where you steal my socks and I let you because your feet in my clothes feels like a promise. Where I love you so badly, so excessively, so incorrectly that it becomes correct through sheer force of will.\n\nPlease. That's all I have left. Please. Turn my symptoms into a diagnosis. Tell me this is terminal. Tell me I'll die from this. Then tell me yes, so at least I'll die yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I hear you waking up. Your first sound is always the same\u2014a small sigh like you're disappointed to leave whatever dream you're in. In ten seconds you'll reach for me and find this letter instead. When you do, know this: that sigh is the sound I want to wake up to for the rest of my life. Even if\u2014especially if\u2014I'm the disappointment you're waking to. I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm out of words but never out of that.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
