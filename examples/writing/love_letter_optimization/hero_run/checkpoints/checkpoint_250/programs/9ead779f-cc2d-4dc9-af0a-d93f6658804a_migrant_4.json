Don't panic\u2014I'm fine. I came here at 2:47 AM because my heart was doing something wrong and I googled the symptoms and WebMD said I was dying. The triage nurse took my vitals, asked what happened, and I said \"I'm in love\" and she said \"Sir, this is a medical emergency\" and I said \"Exactly.\"\n\nShe didn't think it was funny. You would have laughed.\n\nThe truth you wanted: I've been documenting us without permission since Day 1. Not romantically. Clinically. Like a disease I'm tracking. Screenshot from March 3rd, 4:23 PM: \"Leyi used the word 'essentially' four times in one sentence.\" Voice memo, March 19th: \"She's singing to her coffee again. Off-key. Devastating.\" Excel spreadsheet, Column M, Row 847: \"Number of times Leyi has said she's not hungry then eaten all my fries: 23.\"\n\nI have 3,741 photos of you on my phone. You're only aware of maybe twelve. The rest are you existing: reading nutrition labels with religious intensity, arguing with NPR in the car, that thing you do with your face when you're trying to remember if you locked the door. My phone storage is 97% you. The other 3% is mostly screenshots of texts where you used my name unnecessarily. \"Good night, Warren.\" Why did you need to add my name? You've destroyed me with punctuation.\n\nHere's something ugly: I practice losing you. Actual rehearsals. I imagine you leaving, meeting someone better (taller, can actually cook, doesn't check if you're breathing sixteen times per night). I practice being okay with it. I fail every time. Last week I made it four minutes before crying in the Whole Foods parking lot. A child saw me and asked his mom why the sad man was eating cheese straight from the package.\n\nWant to know what loving you is actually like? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Is it normal to save someone's voicemails in triplicate\"\n- \"Can you get physically addicted to how someone smells\"\n- \"Woman reorganized my bookshelf should I propose\"\n- \"Heart palpitations when girlfriend exists\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that love is a medical condition\"\n\nThe doctor just called my name. False alarm\u2014wrong Warren. But that split second where I thought I'd have to leave, stop writing this? My body rejected it. Physically. Like an organ transplant gone wrong, except the organ is you and the body is my entire life.\n\nYou're asleep right now. It's 3:14 AM. In six hours and twelve minutes, you'll wake up, check your phone, see I'm not there, and text \"where are you?\" with no punctuation because morning-you doesn't believe in punctuation. You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me. That's what you've reduced me to. And I'd choose this reduction again in every possible universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "9ead779f-cc2d-4dc9-af0a-d93f6658804a", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701981.349178, "iteration_found": 0, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.7439999999999999, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.78, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.76, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on my phone in the emergency room waiting area.

Unlike Beethoven's cosmic universality (\"my angel, my all, my very self\") which scores 86, this remains earthbound despite moments of transcendence. It surpasses average contemporary work through obsessive specificity and genuine psychological complexity, landing between Oscar Wilde's wit-masked passion (80) and more common accomplished work. The medical emergency frame is genuinely innovative, and the data-tracking of love feels authentically 21st century. However, it lacks the concentrated intensity of Keats's \"I cannot exist without you\" (81) or Johnny Cash's mature simplicity (83). The letter's strength lies in its forensic intimacy and contemporary voice, but it occasionally mistakes quantity of detail for depth of feeling. A score of 73 (weighted average) places it in the proto-masterful range - showing real brilliance but not yet achieving the condensed power of true masterwork."}, "complexity": 0.0, "diversity": 0.0, "metadata": {"changes": "Full rewrite", "parent_metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6990000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.64, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:16 AM because it's the only place where my hands stop shaking long enough to hold a pen.
