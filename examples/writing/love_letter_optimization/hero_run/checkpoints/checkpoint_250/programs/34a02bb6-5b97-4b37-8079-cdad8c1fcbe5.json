Not of you, but of the vastness of what I feel. It's like discovering I've been living in a single room my whole life, and you've shown me there's an entire house. Every morning, I wake up and have to learn again that this is real - that someone can make the act of peeling an orange feel like a small prayer, that laughter can literally hurt from joy, that silence can be its own language when it's shared with you.\n\nI used to think love was about finding someone who completes you. But you haven't completed me - you've complicated me in the most beautiful way. You've made me curious about parts of myself I never knew existed. When you look at me, I don't just feel seen; I feel like I'm worth seeing.\n\nThe truth is, I don't love you despite your contradictions - your terrible handwriting and perfect memory, your fear of spiders but willingness to move across oceans, the way you cry at commercials but stay stoic through real grief. I love you because of them. Because they're the proof that you're real, not some projection of my desires.\n\nIf I'm honest - truly honest - I'm not writing this to convince you. I'm writing it to convince myself that this is happening, that I get to love someone who makes ordinary Tuesday afternoons feel like small revolutions, who has turned my life into a conspiracy of tiny miracles.\n\nI don't know if this moves you.
