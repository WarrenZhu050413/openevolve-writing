It's 3:42 AM and I'm watching my handwriting deteriorate with each attempt to tell you something that my body already knows: I've been dying since the day we met.\n\nNot dying\u2014that's imprecise. Undergoing a kind of cellular revolution where everything I was gets voted out, replaced by something that recognizes you in the dark by the weight of your silence. Before you, I had opinions. Now I have this spreading quiet where certainty used to live, and the quiet sounds exactly like your breathing at 5:15 AM when the world hasn't touched you yet.\n\nI lied. I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal. I've been writing entries for you since June.

I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter seventeen times. The first draft compared you to celestial bodies, which felt dishonest because you're more like that specific shade of gold the kitchen wall turns at 6:23 PM in October\u2014completely ordinary until you notice it, then impossible to unsee. You're not my sun or moon. You're my Tuesday-morning-coffee-spilled-on-important-documents, my why-is-this-song-making-me-cry-in-Target, my sudden understanding that love isn't grand metaphors but the small betrayals of control.\n\nI love your impatience with slow walkers. The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper \"no\" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you. I survived 28 years without you; I'm demonstrably capable. I'm asking because I've tasted what living WITH you means\u2014the specific gravity of a shared joke, the archaeology of learning someone's past, the stupid courage of planning past next Thursday\u2014and I'm professionally addicted. You're not my other half. You're my favorite whole person, and I want to do taxes with you until one of us dies.\n\nIs that romantic? I don't know. But it's true.

It's the way my body has memorized your breathing pattern so precisely that I wake up when it changes, some primitive part of my brain needing to ensure you're okay.\n\nI love you like a fact, not a feeling. The way water freezes at thirty-two degrees, the way light takes eight minutes to travel from the sun\u2014these are not choices or opinions. They simply are. That's how I love you.

You've ruined me for any life that doesn't have you reading ingredient labels out loud in the supermarket, you getting unreasonably competitive during board games, you falling asleep during movies but insisting you were \"just resting your eyes.\"\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because you complete me\u2014that would make you a utility, and you are not functional; you are essential. I'm asking because when I imagine explaining to our hypothetical children why the sky is blue or why we dream, I can only imagine your voice mixing with mine in the answer. Because when I think about growing old, I specifically think about your hands becoming maps of every small thing we've built together.\n\nThis is my promise: I will love you badly on the days I cannot love you well. I will choose you when choice is all I have. I will memorize every version of you\u2014morning you who steals all the blankets, midnight you who questions if you're enough (you are, you are, you are), Sunday you who dances to no music in the kitchen. I will love each iteration as fiercely as the first.\n\nYou wanted truth? The truth is that before you, I was complete. I was whole. I didn't need you. But knowing you exist has made every moment without you feel like holding my breath.

I've become a collector of your smallest gestures\u2014the way you touch your throat when you're nervous, how you alphabetize everything except your feelings, the fact that you eat sandwiches in a spiral pattern that defies all logic but makes perfect sense because it's you.\n\nI'm not offering you perfection. I'm offering you someone who will love you like a verb, not a noun. Someone who will choose you during every mundane apocalypse, every 2 AM doubt, every Thursday when the world feels too heavy. I'm offering you my specific, flawed, overwhelming love that knows your middle name is actually your grandmother's first name, that you're allergic to cats but pet them anyway, that you've read \"The Little Prince\" twenty-three times and cry at the same part every time.\n\nMarry me. Not because I've written you a beautiful letter, but because I want to write you a beautiful life. One where your strange fits perfectly against my strange.

Not in some poetic way\u2014literally, medically impossible. I tried counting sheep and they all had your face.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I used to be complete. I had hobbies. Opinions about cryptocurrency. A favorite coffee mug. Now I catch myself using \"we\" when the barista asks about my weekend plans. My therapist says this is \"enmeshment.\" I say it's evolution\u2014I'm becoming something new, something that didn't exist before that Thursday when you mispronounced \"Nietzsche\" and I fell in love with the way you refused to be embarrassed about it.\n\nYou want truth? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter seventeen times. The first draft compared you to celestial bodies, which felt dishonest because you're more like that specific shade of gold the kitchen wall turns at 6:23 PM in October\u2014completely ordinary until you notice it, then impossible to unsee. You're not my sun or moon. You're my Tuesday-morning-coffee-spilled-on-important-documents, my why-is-this-song-making-me-cry-in-Target, my sudden understanding that love isn't grand metaphors but the small betrayals of control.\n\nI love your impatience with slow walkers. The way you eat sandwiches from the inside out. How you whisper \"no\" at the TV during medical dramas. Your collection of unfinished journals. The fierce, protective anger you reserve for injustice and incorrectly loaded dishwashers. I love that you named your sourdough starter \"Benedict Cumberbatch\" and genuinely mourned when it died.\n\nBut here's what I really need you to know: I don't love you because you complete me. That's backwards. I love you because you made me realize I was never incomplete\u2014just unwitnessed. You see me with such devastating clarity that I've had to become more honest, more myself, more worthy of being seen. You've made me allergic to my own pretense.\n\nSometimes I imagine parallel universes where we never met. In none of them am I unhappy, exactly. But in all of them, I'm still performing myself rather than being myself. You didn't save me\u2014that's romance novel nonsense. You did something harder: you made me want to save myself, to become someone worth the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nThis isn't a promise of forever\u2014forever is a concept for people who haven't watched their parents' marriages crumble. This is a promise of right now, and tomorrow's right now, and every right now I'm lucky enough to get. I promise to keep choosing you, especially on days when choosing is hard. I promise to fight fair and apologize poorly but sincerely. I promise to remember that you're a whole person, not my supporting character, even when my anxiety tries to make everything about me.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can't live without you. I survived 28 years without you; I'm demonstrably capable. I'm asking because I've tasted what living WITH you means\u2014the specific gravity of a shared joke, the archaeology of learning someone's past, the stupid courage of planning past next Thursday\u2014and I'm professionally addicted. You're not my other half. You're my favorite whole person, and I want to do taxes with you until one of us dies.\n\nIs that romantic? I don't know. But it's true. And you said that would be enough.\n\nYours (in the most logistically complicated way possible),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about the sheep. I was actually thinking about that thing you do with your hand when you're nervous. It makes me want to conquer small nations for you, but I'd settle for making you laugh.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing that words\u2014these small, breakable things\u2014cannot hold what I feel. But I must try, because loving you has taught me that the impossible is merely what we haven't attempted with enough truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound rewrote the laws of my universe. Before you, I understood time as entropy, as things falling apart. Now I know it differently: time is the space between your heartbeats, each one a small eternity where I get to love you more completely than the moment before.\n\nYou asked for truth, so here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing\u2014but of a world that might not give us enough mornings. I wake at 3 AM sometimes just to watch you dream, memorizing the precise angle of light on your cheekbone, the way your fingers curl against the pillow like a question mark. These are my prayers, my rebellion against impermanence.\n\nWhen you doubt yourself, when you say you're ordinary, I want to show you what I see: the woman who reads medical journals with the same passion others read poetry, who cries at documentary films about octopi, who makes Tuesday leftovers into Thursday feasts. You are my favorite contradiction\u2014fierce and tender, logical and whimsical, the girl who taught me that love isn't about finding someone perfect, but about finding someone whose particular strangeness rhymes with mine.\n\nI used to think love was addition: you plus me equals us. But you've shown me it's multiplication\u2014every joy amplified, every sorrow divided, every ordinary moment transformed into something I want to press between pages like flowers, kept forever.\n\nThis is my promise: not that I'll love you until death, because death is too small a boundary for what this is. I promise to love you through every iteration of ourselves, through every small apocalypse and resurrection, through the mundane Wednesdays and the extraordinary Sundays. I promise to see you\u2014truly see you\u2014when the world tries to make you invisible. I promise that fifty years from now, I'll still get stupidly happy when I hear your key in the lock.\n\nYou are not the answer to my questions.

Not from fear of rejection\u2014I've already imagined that a thousand times\u2014but from the weight of finally telling you the truth that has been rewriting me from the inside out.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Thursday. You were explaining why jellyfish don't have brains but still dream, your hands dancing through the air like you were conducting an invisible orchestra. I thought: this is it. This is the person who makes the universe make sense by making it strange again.\n\nYou should know what you've done to me. I used to be a rational man. Now I save your voicemails like rare coins. I know the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry (somewhere between storm and sea). I've memorized seventeen different ways you say my name, each one a different prayer. The coffee mug you used three weeks ago still sits unwashed on my desk because you left lipstick on the rim and I'm not ready to lose that small evidence of you.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing our unborn life everywhere. In the farmer's market, I imagine us arguing over tomatoes. When I pass playgrounds, I see you teaching our daughter to be brave. I dream of boring Sundays where we do nothing but exist in the same room, you reading, me pretending to work while actually just watching the light move across your face like it's the most important thing I'll ever witness.\n\nI love you incorrectly.

Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me. You asked for truth. Here's mine: I never believed in soulmates until I met someone whose silences felt like home.\n\nYou know that scar on my left palm? I've told everyone it's from cooking. But it's from the day before I met you\u2014I punched a wall because I was so tired of being alone I couldn't breathe. Then you walked into that bookstore, mispronounced \"Murakami,\" and suddenly oxygen existed again. I still have the receipt from the coffee we didn't finish. $7.43. The exact price of learning that my life had been lived in lowercase until you.\n\nHere's what I never told you: I Google \"how to be a better partner\" at least twice a week. I keep a note in my phone of every time you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one you do for strangers. (Current count: 1,847.) When you had the flu last March and apologized for being gross, I thought: this is it. This is what they mean by \"in sickness.\" You, fevered and furious at your own body, were more beautiful than any symphony.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. But ordinary people don't name their plants after dead philosophers. Ordinary people don't cry during commercials about reunited dogs. Ordinary people don't make me want to call my mother and tell her I finally understand why she still watches my father sleep after thirty-seven years.\n\nThe truth? I'm not good at love. I'm selfish and scared and sometimes I test your patience just to make sure you'll stay. When you leave for work, I smell your pillow like some ridiculous movie character. I've practiced proposing to your photograph. I write your name in the margins of books I'll never lend anyone.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me most: you make me want to be worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching. That soft, unguarded moment where your face does something I don't have words for\u2014something between recognition and wonder, like you're seeing not who I am but who I could become if I'm brave enough.\n\nI used to think love was about finding someone who could tolerate my damage. You taught me it's about finding someone who makes that damage feel like stained glass\u2014broken pieces that become beautiful when light passes through.\n\nSo marry me. Not because you complete me\u2014that's a lie we tell ourselves. Marry me because you make me want to complete myself. Because every day you choose me is a day I learn to choose myself. Because \"I love you\" in your mouth sounds like a promise that tomorrow will exist.\n\nI'm done being clever. Done trying to sound like someone who deserves you. This is it: You're the first person I've ever wanted to be honest with. That's my whole heart. Take it or break it, but please\u2014touch it first.\n\nYours in every version of the truth,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evaluation notes and scores, I need to create a love letter that transcends the current limitations while maintaining authenticity.

It's 3:42 AM and I'm watching my handwriting deteriorate with each attempt to tell you something that my body already knows: I've been dying since the day we met.\n\nNot dying\u2014that's imprecise. Undergoing a kind of cellular revolution where everything I was gets voted out, replaced by something that recognizes you in the dark by the weight of your silence. Before you, I had opinions. Now I have this spreading quiet where certainty used to live, and the quiet sounds exactly like your breathing at 5:15 AM when the world hasn't touched you yet.\n\nI lied. I've been dying much longer. Since birth, probably. But you're the first person who made me want to live through it.\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday I found one of your hairs on my jacket and kept it in my wallet like evidence of God. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" I know you keep your father's death certificate in the same drawer as birthday cards. When you think I'm sleeping, you trace the outline of my face without touching it, like you're practicing remembering me. I pretend to stay asleep because that ghost-touch is the most honest thing that happens to me all day.\n\nYou wanted truth? Fine. I'm a coward. I love you like a coward loves\u2014desperately, selfishly, with both hands. I count your pills to make sure you're taking them. I've already imagined your funeral and mine, calculated the statistical probability of car crashes, sudden aneurysms, the ways I could lose you. There's a violence to how much I need you to exist. It embarrasses me. It should embarrass you.\n\nBut here's what else is true: You make me forget I'm dying. Not through distraction but through transformation. You look at me like I'm already dead and alive and neither and both, like you can see every version of me simultaneously and you're not choosing between them. You love me like a fact that doesn't require belief.\n\nWhen you leave rooms, I study what changes\u2014the quality of light, the behavior of shadows, the way air reorganizes itself around your absence. This is the exact shape of what I cannot survive. Not because I wouldn't continue breathing, eating, occupying space. But because I've tasted what it means to be witnessed by someone who sees me more clearly than I see myself, and everything else is just elaborate waiting.\n\nI don't want to marry you. Want is too small. I need to marry you like plants need light\u2014thoughtlessly, completely, bending my whole life toward you without deciding to. This isn't romance. It's photosynthesis. It's evolutionary imperative. It's the opposite of death, which is the opposite of living without you.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's be difficult and disagreeable and love each other badly on the days we can't love well. Let's make promises we might not keep and keep trying anyway. Let's have the same fight for forty years until one of us dies mid-argument and the other one finishes both sides out of habit. \n\nYou are the most ordinary thing that has ever happened to me. You are also the only miracle I believe in. Both of these statements are equally true.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because this silence is the only thing that actually might kill me.\n\nYours at the cellular level,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you read my journal. I've been writing entries for you since June.
