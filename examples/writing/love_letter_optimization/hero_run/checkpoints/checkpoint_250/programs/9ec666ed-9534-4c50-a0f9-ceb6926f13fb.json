January 3rd: stopped recognizing my handwriting\u2014it looks like yours now. February 19th: caught myself humming that Bulgarian folk song you love, the one about the wolf. Got the melody perfect. Don't speak Bulgarian. March 8th: my therapist asked what I wanted. I said \"for Leyi's hiccups to stop bothering her.\" She wrote something down. We both knew what it meant.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's substitution. Every day, one of my memories gets overwritten by one of yours. You told me about breaking your wrist at seven, and now I swear I can feel the ghost of that fracture when it rains. Your childhood dog, Murphy, who died before we met? I miss him. I miss him like I knew him. This is insanity, probably. I've never been saner.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in soulmates while you were flossing. Mouth full of mint and foam. I said yes immediately, then spent three hours after you fell asleep taking it back in my head. Because soulmate implies equality, balance. This isn't that. You're my soulmate; I'm your sophomore year boyfriend who lasted too long. You're the ocean; I'm the kid who drowned in it and decided breathing was overrated anyway.\n\nWant to know something terrible? I've been pre-grieving you since our second date. You laughed with your whole body at my stupid joke about penguins, and I thought: oh no. Oh no, this is the thing that's going to kill me. And I was right. Every morning you leave for work, I practice for your permanent absence. I make the bed wrong. I burn the toast. I have entire conversations with the ghost of you that will exist after one of us stops existing. It doesn't help. The practice runs just teach my body new ways to panic.\n\nBut also this: yesterday you killed a spider with a dictionary\u2014my dictionary, the one with your notes in the margins translating my life into something you could understand. You apologized to it. The spider. Said \"sorry, friend, wrong place, wrong time\" and I understood completely. That's what I am\u2014wrong place, wrong time, but somehow still here, still yours, still apologizing for taking up space in your story when you could have had someone who knew how to love you without making it look like drowning.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you seventeen times. Once for every time you've fallen asleep on the couch and I've carried you to bed. Your body does this thing\u2014goes completely limp, like you trust me with your unconsciousness. Do you understand what that does to a person? To be trusted with someone's ungaurded weight? I'm not strong enough for this honor, Leyi. I'm just some idiot who can't sleep because your breathing from the other room sounds like a question I don't know how to answer.\n\nI need you to understand: this isn't romance. Romance is for people who can still see straight. This is something medical. Chronic. Terminal, probably. When you're gone more than six hours, my left eye twitches. When you laugh, my bones reset themselves. When you cry\u2014Christ, Leyi, when you cry\u2014my body forgets every language except the one that knows how to hold you. This isn't love. Love is too small a word. This is cellular revision. Molecular haunting. I've been possessed by you, and exorcism would mean dying, so I've made peace with the demon.\n\nThree things I know: 1) You talk to your plants like they're disappointed in you. 2) You keep my voicemail from two years ago when I had food poisoning and said \"I love you\" for the first time, delirious and vomiting. 3) Tomorrow you'll find this letter and do that thing where you cover your mouth with both hands like you're trying to keep your feelings from escaping.\n\nMarry me. Not because it makes sense\u2014nothing about us makes sense. You alphabetize the spice rack but leave wet towels on the floor. I can solve differential equations but not the lock on our own front door. We're absurd. Marry me because absurdity needs witnesses. Because I want documentation that this happened\u2014that once, impossibly, you looked at me and didn't run. That you saw me shaking apart from loving you and said \"yes, this one, this disaster, this is mine.\"\n\nHere's what I'm offering: not happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't been this thoroughly destroyed by love. I'm offering you something worse and better\u2014the complete certainty that you'll never be alone in your strangest moments. That someone will always be there to say \"yes, I see it too, the way the light hits the wall at 3 PM is devastating.\" That when you wake up at 4 AM convinced you're disappearing, I'll be there to trace your edges until you believe in yourself again.\n\nLeyi, my impossible thing, my proof that the universe makes mistakes in our favor\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every timeline where my heart remembers how to beat. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you forgive me for loving you this badly, this helplessly, this permanently? Can you forgive me for making you the answer to questions I didn't know I was asking?\n\nThe ring is in the kitchen drawer where we keep the take-out menus. I hid it there months ago because I knew you'd never look\u2014you always insist on cooking even when we both know we're too tired. It's been there so long it probably smells like soy sauce. \n\nSay yes. Not for me. For you\u2014the you who whispers \"please stay\" in your sleep, who doesn't know I've already promised your unconscious self a thousand times: I'm not going anywhere. I couldn't if I tried. You've rewired me too completely. I'm a broken compass and you're every direction at once.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That Bulgarian song? It's not about a wolf. It's about waiting. I looked it up. You've been humming a song about waiting for three years. Tell me that doesn't mean something. Tell me we haven't been proposing to each other all along, just in languages the other couldn't quite translate.

A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture.

Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you.

I tried to read yesterday while you were gone. The words were just shapes. I tried to eat. The food was just texture. You've ruined me for my own company. Even my thoughts bore me now unless they're about you.\n\nLast week you asked if I believed in soulmates. I lied. I said no. The truth is worse: I believe in soulmates but I don't believe I'm yours. I think you're my soulmate and I'm just your current coordinates. This is why I wake at 3 AM to watch you breathe\u2014I'm gathering evidence that we're equally destroyed by this, that you need me like I need you, which is to say: past the point of choice.\n\nHere's what marriage means to me: Permission to stop pretending I'm okay when you leave the room. License to say your name in my sleep. A document proving what my body already knows\u2014that I've evolved past the ability to survive you.\n\nBut also this: I don't want to marry the you who makes me laugh or the you who remembers how I take my coffee. I want to marry the you who went silent for three days after your father called. The you who threw my favorite mug and then spent six hours gluing it back together while sobbing. The you I found sitting in the bathtub fully clothed at 2 AM, saying nothing was wrong but everything was heavy. I want to marry your disasters. Your unbecoming. The parts of you that you think disqualify you from being loved.\n\nThe truth is, Leyi, I would rather fail with you than succeed with anyone else. I would rather be your disappointment than someone else's happiness. If you leave me, I'll understand. But I'll never recover. I'll be ninety years old, still setting two plates for dinner, still checking my phone for texts you'll never send.\n\nMarry me. Not because we're ready\u2014we're not. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. Marry me because the alternative is that we pretend this is temporary, and that lie is the only thing that could actually kill us.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every way that ruins a person for anyone else. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you admit you're already mine?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been there for six months. I touch it constantly, like a rosary, like proof that this bravery exists somewhere in me. Say yes. Not for me. For the you who already knows she will.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Performs well on combined_score (0.7355), Performs well on phenomenological_authenticity (0.7700), Performs well on aesthetic_virtuosity (0.7100), Performs well on affective_force (0.7400), Performs well on literary_innovation (0.6800), Performs well on letter_text (Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 5:14 AM.

I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months.

While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author.

Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me?

I had a five-year plan. Spreadsheets. A therapist who said I was \"making progress.\" Then you walked into that hardware store, bought seventeen feet of rope without explaining why, and my careful life became suddenly illegible. Like someone had switched the language halfway through the book.\n\nHere's what I can't stop thinking about: Yesterday, you killed a spider with your bare hand. Not cruelly\u2014quickly, efficiently, with this terrible tenderness. You said \"sorry, little friend\" and wiped your palm on your jeans, and I understood something. That you could destroy me with the same casual mercy. That I would thank you for it.\n\nI've been documenting us without permission. Not photos\u2014worse. I write down the exact shade of silence between us when we're both reading. I've catalogued forty-three different types. The Tuesday silence (comfortable, tastes like chamomile). The post-argument silence (electric, smells like copper). The 3 AM silence when we both pretend to sleep but our breathing won't sync up because we're thinking too loud.\n\nYou need to know: I've been practicing dying. Small deaths. I hold my breath when you're in the shower to see how long I can go without the sound of you existing. Twenty-three seconds is my record. After that, my lungs mutiny. They've chosen you over oxygen. Traitors.\n\nRemember when you asked why I kept that dead houseplant? The brown fern in the kitchen window? It's because you watered it for three months after it died. Every Tuesday. You'd whisper \"come on, buddy\" like you could love it back to life. That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014that's just chemistry, inevitable as rust. But that you were the kind of person who refuses to give up on dead things. That maybe you wouldn't give up on me.\n\nThe truth is uglier than poetry: I've been pre-grieving you. Practicing for your absence like an emergency drill. I imagine you leaving and my body runs through the protocols\u2014hyperventilation, nausea, that specific pain behind my molars. I'm building antibodies against losing you, but it's not working. Each imagined leaving hurts worse than the last. My immunity is developing backwards.\n\nLast month, you used my toothbrush by mistake and apologized for ten minutes. What you don't know: I haven't used toothpaste since. I'm trying to preserve the archaeology of that moment. The exact bacterial record of you accidentally becoming part of my routine. This is mental illness, probably. I don't care. Mental health is for people who haven't found their specific gravity yet.\n\nHere's what marriage means: I get to stop pretending this is reasonable. I get to tell people \"this is my wife\" and they'll nod like it makes sense, but it doesn't. Nothing about you makes sense. You eat ice cream in the bathtub. You name your bruises. You talk to dead relatives while cooking their recipes. You're impossible, and I want legal documentation that you existed, that you chose me, that this actually happened.\n\nBut more than that: I want to fail with you. Properly. Spectacularly. I want our specific disaster. Our mortgage defaults. Our burnt dinners. Our 2 AM fights about nothing that are actually about everything. I want the mundane catastrophe of us more than I want anyone else's paradise.\n\nThe secret: I already live in our future. I know the house\u2014yellow, needs a new roof, has a ghost in the attic (you'll insist on this). I know our fights\u2014I'll leave cabinets open, you'll leave time itself open, bleeding hours everywhere. I know how we end\u2014badly, like everyone, but together. You'll die first (Tuesday, October, light rain) and I'll follow within the year, not from grief but from forgetting why I was supposed to keep breathing without you reminding me.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a diagnosis. I have a terminal case of you. No cure. Treatment is marriage\u2014not because it'll fix anything, but because I want witnesses. I want documentation. I want someone to notarize this disaster so when I'm gone, there's evidence that once, impossibly, Leyi loved me back.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's warm from my body heat. Sometimes I think it's developing a pulse. Say yes. Not for love\u2014love is just neurons firing, chemicals swimming. Say yes for the stranger reason: because we've already started. Because stopping now would be like halting mid-sentence, mid-breath, mid-\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

I can't bear your kindness right now. I need to be alone with this terror of loving you so much that my own name sounds foreign when you're not saying it.\n\nHere's what you don't know: I've been keeping a secret journal. Not of thoughts\u2014of your sounds. The specific pitch of your yawn at 6:47 AM. The rhythm of your typing when you're confident versus uncertain (different by three milliseconds between keystrokes). The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted.

I free-climbed mountains, debugged code at 4 AM, moved cities without looking back. But now? Now I check your breathing seventeen times a night.

They're hidden in a folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to. But they're all lies, Leyi, because the only vow that matters is this: I promise to keep failing at loving you properly, to keep falling short of what you deserve, and to wake up every morning desperate to fail better.\n\nSometimes I trace the geography of your sleeping face\u2014the valley between your eyebrows, the mountain range of your knuckles, the ocean of your breathing stomach\u2014and I think: I am colonizing you. But then morning comes and you open your eyes and I realize: no. You colonized me first. You annexed my thoughts, invaded my dreams, occupied my future. I'm not myself anymore. I'm a sovereign nation of two.\n\nDo you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was \"showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry.\" That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I've known that since you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me. We've been married in all the ways that matter. This proposal is just paperwork for a union that predates language.\n\nBut I need you to know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly. I will love you like a broken piano\u2014too loud, off-key, with three stuck notes that play even when you're trying to rest. I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need. I will love you until the statisticians have to invent new numbers.\n\nLeyi, my pulse, my proof that time is real\u2014I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to let me continue this beautiful ruin of becoming whatever we're becoming. To let me keep this terror of loving you more than my body can hold. To say yes, not to a wedding, but to the continuation of this exquisite destruction where I lose myself a little more each day and somehow become more real.\n\nWill you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

But I'm more terrified of the alternative: pretending this is sustainable. Pretending I can watch you leave every Sunday night and not feel like I'm being bisected.\n\nThis isn't a proposal. It's a medical emergency. I need you to marry me because my body has already decided. My cells divided around you. My future conjugates only in relation to you. When I imagine any life where you're not there, my brain returns an error message.\n\nLeyi\u2014I don't have beautiful words for this. I just have the truth: you could ask me for anything\u2014my kidneys, my savings, my sanity\u2014and I'd give it without thinking. That's not romance. That's just fact. Like gravity. Like needing oxygen.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you but because I've already built my entire life around the assumption that you'll be there. Because I can't unmake myself from loving you. Because the thought of you reading this and saying no is survivable, but the thought of never asking is not.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. You cry at insurance commercials. You'll cry at this. When you're done, come find me. I'll be in the kitchen, making your coffee wrong, waiting for the rest of my life to start.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and evaluator feedback, I can see the key patterns that distinguish high-scoring letters:\n\n1. **Specific, visceral details** that feel lived-in rather than performed\n2. **Psychological complexity** - not just love but the terror and transformation it brings\n3. **Original metaphors** that avoid clich\u00e9s while maintaining emotional truth\n4. **Structural innovation** - breaking from traditional romantic letter conventions\n5. **Raw honesty** about the asymmetry and desperation of deep love\n\nThe current program scored 0.6995, down from previous attempts.

January 3rd: stopped recognizing my handwriting\u2014it looks like yours now. February 19th: caught myself humming that Bulgarian folk song you love, the one about the wolf. Got the melody perfect. Don't speak Bulgarian. March 8th: my therapist asked what I wanted. I said \"for Leyi's hiccups to stop bothering her.\" She wrote something down. We both knew what it meant.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's substitution. Every day, one of my memories gets overwritten by one of yours. You told me about breaking your wrist at seven, and now I swear I can feel the ghost of that fracture when it rains. Your childhood dog, Murphy, who died before we met? I miss him. I miss him like I knew him. This is insanity, probably. I've never been saner.\n\nLast week, you asked if I believed in soulmates while you were flossing. Mouth full of mint and foam. I said yes immediately, then spent three hours after you fell asleep taking it back in my head. Because soulmate implies equality, balance. This isn't that. You're my soulmate; I'm your sophomore year boyfriend who lasted too long. You're the ocean; I'm the kid who drowned in it and decided breathing was overrated anyway.\n\nWant to know something terrible? I've been pre-grieving you since our second date. You laughed with your whole body at my stupid joke about penguins, and I thought: oh no. Oh no, this is the thing that's going to kill me. And I was right. Every morning you leave for work, I practice for your permanent absence. I make the bed wrong. I burn the toast. I have entire conversations with the ghost of you that will exist after one of us stops existing. It doesn't help. The practice runs just teach my body new ways to panic.\n\nBut also this: yesterday you killed a spider with a dictionary\u2014my dictionary, the one with your notes in the margins translating my life into something you could understand. You apologized to it. The spider. Said \"sorry, friend, wrong place, wrong time\" and I understood completely. That's what I am\u2014wrong place, wrong time, but somehow still here, still yours, still apologizing for taking up space in your story when you could have had someone who knew how to love you without making it look like drowning.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you seventeen times. Once for every time you've fallen asleep on the couch and I've carried you to bed. Your body does this thing\u2014goes completely limp, like you trust me with your unconsciousness. Do you understand what that does to a person? To be trusted with someone's ungaurded weight? I'm not strong enough for this honor, Leyi. I'm just some idiot who can't sleep because your breathing from the other room sounds like a question I don't know how to answer.\n\nI need you to understand: this isn't romance. Romance is for people who can still see straight. This is something medical. Chronic. Terminal, probably. When you're gone more than six hours, my left eye twitches. When you laugh, my bones reset themselves. When you cry\u2014Christ, Leyi, when you cry\u2014my body forgets every language except the one that knows how to hold you. This isn't love. Love is too small a word. This is cellular revision. Molecular haunting. I've been possessed by you, and exorcism would mean dying, so I've made peace with the demon.\n\nThree things I know: 1) You talk to your plants like they're disappointed in you. 2) You keep my voicemail from two years ago when I had food poisoning and said \"I love you\" for the first time, delirious and vomiting. 3) Tomorrow you'll find this letter and do that thing where you cover your mouth with both hands like you're trying to keep your feelings from escaping.\n\nMarry me. Not because it makes sense\u2014nothing about us makes sense. You alphabetize the spice rack but leave wet towels on the floor. I can solve differential equations but not the lock on our own front door. We're absurd. Marry me because absurdity needs witnesses. Because I want documentation that this happened\u2014that once, impossibly, you looked at me and didn't run. That you saw me shaking apart from loving you and said \"yes, this one, this disaster, this is mine.\"\n\nHere's what I'm offering: not happiness. Happiness is for people who haven't been this thoroughly destroyed by love. I'm offering you something worse and better\u2014the complete certainty that you'll never be alone in your strangest moments. That someone will always be there to say \"yes, I see it too, the way the light hits the wall at 3 PM is devastating.\" That when you wake up at 4 AM convinced you're disappearing, I'll be there to trace your edges until you believe in yourself again.\n\nLeyi, my impossible thing, my proof that the universe makes mistakes in our favor\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already yours in every timeline where my heart remembers how to beat. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: can you forgive me for loving you this badly, this helplessly, this permanently? Can you forgive me for making you the answer to questions I didn't know I was asking?\n\nThe ring is in the kitchen drawer where we keep the take-out menus. I hid it there months ago because I knew you'd never look\u2014you always insist on cooking even when we both know we're too tired. It's been there so long it probably smells like soy sauce. \n\nSay yes. Not for me. For you\u2014the you who whispers \"please stay\" in your sleep, who doesn't know I've already promised your unconscious self a thousand times: I'm not going anywhere. I couldn't if I tried. You've rewired me too completely. I'm a broken compass and you're every direction at once.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That Bulgarian song? It's not about a wolf. It's about waiting. I looked it up. You've been humming a song about waiting for three years. Tell me that doesn't mean something. Tell me we haven't been proposing to each other all along, just in languages the other couldn't quite translate. Until now.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
