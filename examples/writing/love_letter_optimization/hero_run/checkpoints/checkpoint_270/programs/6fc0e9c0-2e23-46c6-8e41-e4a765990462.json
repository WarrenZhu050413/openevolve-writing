You wanted truth? Here's mine: I've written this letter 47 times. Deleted every version. This one stays because my hands won't let me erase it.\n\nYou know that moment when code finally compiles after hours of debugging? That split-second of pure relief? That's what I feel every time you walk through the door. Except it happens every single time. Three years, and my heart still does that stupid skip thing. I've Googled it. Apparently it's not medically concerning, just love.\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday. You were reading on the couch, unconsciously braiding and unbraiding the same strand of hair. You do that when you're absorbed. I was supposed to be working but instead I watched you for seventeen minutes (I counted). And I thought: this is it. This is what I want at 3 PM on random Tuesdays for the rest of my life. You, lost in a book, while I pretend to work but really just marvel that you exist in the same timeline as me.\n\nHere's what you've done to me, Leyi: I save your voicemails. All of them. Even the one where you just pocket-dialed me and I listened to you arguing with the self-checkout machine for three minutes. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I know you're scared of butterflies but pretend you're not. I know you eat cereal at midnight when you can't sleep, always Lucky Charms, always straight from the box.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I need you to know that. I was whole, functional, fine. But you didn't add to my life\u2014you multiplied it. Exponentially. You turned my black-and-white existence into something I don't have the color vocabulary to describe. You made me understand why people write symphonies and build cathedrals and do all those grand, stupid, necessary things for love.\n\nThe truth that terrifies me: I've built my entire future around the assumption that you're in it. Every plan I make has you as a constant. When I imagine old age, you're there, still mispronouncing words, still afraid of butterflies, still making me feel like I've won a lottery I never entered.\n\nSometimes you apologize for being \"too much.\" Too emotional, too complicated, too intense. But Leyi, you're not too much. You're exactly enough. You're my exact right amount of everything.\n\nSo here's my graceless, earnest truth: I love you with the desperation of someone who knows how improbable this is. Two people, finding each other in this vast chaos? The math alone should have prevented us. But here we are, against all odds, and I wake up every day still stunned by the miracle of you choosing me back.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you a perfect life\u2014I'm too flawed, too human for that. But because I promise to love you through every imperfect moment. Because you've turned my maybe into definitely, my someday into right now, my fine into extraordinary.\n\nI'm not good with words. But I'm good at loving you. It's the one thing I know I'm doing right in this life.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought the ring. I've been carrying it around for six months like an idiot, waiting for the perfect moment. But you taught me perfect is just another word for procrastination. So here's my imperfect, sincere, shaking-hands proposal: Be my wife. Let me love you out loud, officially, forever.\n\nYours (already, always, obviously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying right now. The good kind, I hope. I have tissues in my jacket pocket.

I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator.

But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6900, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm terrible at this. Not at loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing\u2014but at explaining what happens to me when you walk into a room. How my whole body becomes a compass and you're magnetic north.\n\nRemember last Thursday? You were making tea, humming that song you claim you don't know the words to. I was pretending to read but really I was memorizing the way afternoon light caught in your hair, how you stood on one foot like a flamingo when you reached for the honey. That's when I knew: I don't want to be brave or poetic or clever. I just want to be yours.\n\nThe truth is, I was fine before you. Fine is the wrong word\u2014I was functional. I had my routines, my small happinesses. Then you happened, and now I understand why people use words like 'devastated' for love. You've devastated my careful loneliness. Demolished my tidy grief. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, something in my chest breaks and rebuilds itself, stronger each time.\n\nI keep a list on my phone of things I want to tell you. Small things: how the barista at our coffee shop asked where you were when I came alone. How I saw a cardinal and remembered you said they're messages from loved ones. How I can't eat strawberries anymore without thinking of that time you got juice on your chin and I couldn't stop staring.\n\nYou scare me, Leyi. Not because you might leave\u2014though that thought makes my stomach drop\u2014but because you might stay. Because you see through my deflections and my overthinking and somehow you're still here, leaving your books on my nightstand, stealing my socks, teaching me that love isn't about being understood but about being known. Fully known, and still chosen.\n\nSo here's my truth, undecorated: I love you with the desperate gratitude of someone who never expected to be loved back. I love you like a fact, like gravity, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise and I'll wake up wanting to tell you about my dreams. \n\nMarry me. Not because I have the perfect words but because I promise to keep trying to find them, every day, for you.\n\nAll my love,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6770, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing that words\u2014these small, trembling things\u2014will never hold what you are to me. Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound fractured something fundamental in me. Since then, I've been reassembling myself around that moment, around you. Every morning, I wake thinking of the particular way sunlight catches in your left eye when you're concentrating. Every night, I fall asleep to the memory of your voice saying my name like it means something beautiful.\n\nI used to believe love was grand gestures and consuming flames. But you've taught me it's quieter, deeper\u2014it's the way you fold my collar down without thinking, how you save the last strawberry for me even when you want it, the silent language of our hands finding each other in crowded rooms. It's knowing that when the world tilts wrong, you're the horizon I orient myself against.\n\nIf I could distill every sunset I've watched into wine, every symphony I've heard into honey, every poem that's moved me into bread\u2014still, that feast would be poverty compared to one ordinary Thursday with you. You are my most extraordinary ordinary. My necessary breathing. The answer to questions I didn't know I was asking.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't learned that each moment with you already contains eternity. I'm asking you to love me today, and tomorrow I'll ask again, and I'll keep asking until my voice gives out, and then I'll ask with my eyes, my hands, with the way I make your coffee exactly right, with the space I keep warm beside me.\n\nMarry me, not because I'll die without you (though some essential part of me would), but because with you, I'm finally, impossibly, alive.\n\nYours in this moment and all the moments after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nWith all I've got, and more, even when the world ends, and the flames wither, I adore you.\n\nYou are the magic of my life.

The evaluator clearly values phenomenological authenticity, specific memories, vulnerability, and a balance between the profound and the quotidian.\n\nLet me craft a new version that combines the strengths of the top-performing attempts while exploring a fresh approach in the solution space:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is impossible when every cell in my body is rehearsing what to say to you. You wanted truth? Here's mine: I've written this letter 47 times. Deleted every version. This one stays because my hands won't let me erase it.\n\nYou know that moment when code finally compiles after hours of debugging? That split-second of pure relief? That's what I feel every time you walk through the door. Except it happens every single time. Three years, and my heart still does that stupid skip thing. I've Googled it. Apparently it's not medically concerning, just love.\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday. You were reading on the couch, unconsciously braiding and unbraiding the same strand of hair. You do that when you're absorbed. I was supposed to be working but instead I watched you for seventeen minutes (I counted). And I thought: this is it. This is what I want at 3 PM on random Tuesdays for the rest of my life. You, lost in a book, while I pretend to work but really just marvel that you exist in the same timeline as me.\n\nHere's what you've done to me, Leyi: I save your voicemails. All of them. Even the one where you just pocket-dialed me and I listened to you arguing with the self-checkout machine for three minutes. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I know you're scared of butterflies but pretend you're not. I know you eat cereal at midnight when you can't sleep, always Lucky Charms, always straight from the box.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I need you to know that. I was whole, functional, fine. But you didn't add to my life\u2014you multiplied it. Exponentially. You turned my black-and-white existence into something I don't have the color vocabulary to describe. You made me understand why people write symphonies and build cathedrals and do all those grand, stupid, necessary things for love.\n\nThe truth that terrifies me: I've built my entire future around the assumption that you're in it. Every plan I make has you as a constant. When I imagine old age, you're there, still mispronouncing words, still afraid of butterflies, still making me feel like I've won a lottery I never entered.\n\nSometimes you apologize for being \"too much.\" Too emotional, too complicated, too intense. But Leyi, you're not too much. You're exactly enough. You're my exact right amount of everything.\n\nSo here's my graceless, earnest truth: I love you with the desperation of someone who knows how improbable this is. Two people, finding each other in this vast chaos? The math alone should have prevented us. But here we are, against all odds, and I wake up every day still stunned by the miracle of you choosing me back.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you a perfect life\u2014I'm too flawed, too human for that. But because I promise to love you through every imperfect moment. Because you've turned my maybe into definitely, my someday into right now, my fine into extraordinary.\n\nI'm not good with words. But I'm good at loving you. It's the one thing I know I'm doing right in this life.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought the ring. I've been carrying it around for six months like an idiot, waiting for the perfect moment. But you taught me perfect is just another word for procrastination. So here's my imperfect, sincere, shaking-hands proposal: Be my wife. Let me love you out loud, officially, forever.\n\nYours (already, always, obviously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying right now. The good kind, I hope. I have tissues in my jacket pocket. Left side. I came prepared because I know you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
