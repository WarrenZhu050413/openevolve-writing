My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork.

It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying.

Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG.

Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now.

It's my search history:\n- \"Is it normal to save someone's voicemails in triplicate\"\n- \"Can you get physically addicted to how someone smells\"\n- \"Woman reorganized my bookshelf should I propose\"\n- \"Heart palpitations when girlfriend exists\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that love is a medical condition\"\n\nThe doctor just called my name. False alarm\u2014wrong Warren. But that split second where I thought I'd have to leave, stop writing this? My body rejected it. Physically. Like an organ transplant gone wrong, except the organ is you and the body is my entire life.\n\nYou're asleep right now. It's 3:14 AM. In six hours and twelve minutes, you'll wake up, check your phone, see I'm not there, and text \"where are you?\" with no punctuation because morning-you doesn't believe in punctuation. You'll be wearing my Nirvana shirt you swear you didn't steal. Your hair will be doing that thing that defies physics and resembles a beautiful explosion. You'll make coffee wrong (milk first, like a psychopath I'm desperately in love with).\n\nThe truth under the truth under the truth: I'm not proposing. I'm stating a fact. We're already married in every timeline that matters. My bones know your bones. When archaeologists find us in a thousand years, we'll be twisted together like DNA, and they'll say \"look, these two died of the same disease\" and they'll be right. The disease is this: loving you so specifically that every other feeling seems like a rough draft.\n\nI just watched someone get wheeled past on a gurney and thought: if that was you, I would burn down the concept of hospitals. I would invent new medicine. I would become God just to rewrite the rules. This isn't romantic. This is me, at 3:22 AM, in a room that smells like antiseptic and fear, writing my 47th attempt at this letter while strangers have actual emergencies, and all I can think is: you mispronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when you're excited and it makes me want to die. The good kind of dying. The kind where you come back more alive.\n\nSo here's my medical emergency: I need you to marry me. Not want. Need. Like lungs need oxygen, except I've checked and I can hold my breath for 73 seconds but I can't go more than 4 seconds without thinking about that sound you make when you stretch. That little squeak. You don't know you do it. I have 134 recordings.\n\nI'm giving the nurse this letter to mail because if I hand it to you directly, I'll throw up. Or cry. Or both. Probably both. She says she's seen everything but she's never seen someone write a proposal on hospital stationary while checking their pulse every thirty seconds to make sure love hasn't actually killed them.\n\nIt hasn't. But Leyi, it's trying.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that I'm already terminal with you. Have been since that Thursday when you got hiccups during your own story and laughed so hard you cried and I thought: this is it. This is how I die. Watching someone hiccup-laugh in a Starbucks. What a way to go.\n\nYours in sickness and in slightly less sickness,\nWarren\n\nP.S. The janitor just read this over my shoulder and said \"Jesus, man, just marry her already\" and I said \"I'M TRYING\" and now security is looking at me. This is what you've done. You've made me the kind of man who yells at janitors about love. I used to be normal. I had hobbies that weren't \"counting Leyi's breathing patterns.\" Now I'm googling \"can the human heart actually explode from feelings\" in a medical facility where they could actually tell me. (The answer is technically no but experientially yes.)\n\nP.P.S. My discharge papers say \"Patient presented with non-cardiac chest pain secondary to acute emotional dysregulation.\" That's medical for \"this idiot is in love.\" Even the hospital knows. Everyone knows. The only person who doesn't know how gone I am is you, and that's only because you think everyone practices their proposal speech to houseplants. They don't, Leyi. That's just me. That's what you've reduced me to. And I'd choose this reduction again in every possible universe.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7440)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the kitchen at 4:19 AM. The dishwasher just finished its cycle and keeps making that clicking sound you insist is morse code. I've been sitting here for two hours with a notepad, a calculator, and what's left of my sanity, trying to quantify something that breaks every time I measure it.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been running experiments on myself. Documented. Peer-reviewed by no one. Subject: one man, age irrelevant, completely compromised by love. Method: expose subject to varying levels of Leyi. Results: catastrophic systems failure across all metrics. Heart rate baseline permanently elevated by 23%. Sleep efficiency decreased 41% due to \"checking if she's still breathing\" compulsion. New neural pathways formed exclusively for storing the way you pronounce \"specifically\" as \"pacifically\" when angry.\n\nHere's what I've never told you: I hired a private investigator. On myself. To follow me following you. I needed proof I was as far gone as I suspected. His report, verbatim: \"Subject exhibits signs of severe psychological dependency. Spent seventeen minutes in Target sniffing shampoos to find client's brand. Cried during purchase. Recommend immediate intervention.\" I tipped him extra to destroy the evidence.\n\nTruth: I've been practicing your death in increments. Not wanting it\u2014preparing for it like a fire drill for grief. Tuesday: imagined you choking on a grape. Heimliched the air for three minutes. Wednesday: car accident. Planned the funeral, the music (that song you butcher in the shower), the lawsuit against Toyota. Thursday: old age. This one broke me because I realized I'd rather die at thirty with you than live to ninety without you. This isn't romantic. This is math. Simple arithmetic of a life that only computes with you as a constant.\n\nBut here's the worst part, the thing that would get me committed: You're ordinary. Statistically average height. Laugh frequency within normal range. One standard deviation from baseline pretty. But last Tuesday you parallel parked while eating a burrito and my DNA literally rewrote itself. I felt it happen. A cellular restructuring that started in my bones and radiated outward until even my fingernails knew they existed only to scratch your back in the patterns you like\u2014circles, never lines, counterclockwise, lighter on Sundays.\n\nI have a file. Hidden, encrypted, labeled \"Tax Backup 2019.\" It's 47 gigabytes of you. Audio recordings of you explaining the plot of movies wrong. Sixteen different versions of you saying \"good morning\" (pitch analysis reveals you're happiest on Thursdays). A spreadsheet tracking your menstrual cycle, not creepily, scientifically, so I know when to have chocolate and ibuprofen and that specific brand of heating pad that smells like lavender. Cell G-47 contains the data: you're three days late. I know before you do. I've already googled \"how to be a father\" four hundred times just in case.\n\nYou know what loving you really is? It's not poetry. It's my search history:\n- \"Normal to create PowerPoint about girlfriend's sleep patterns?\"\n- \"Can you physically die from someone being too cute?\"\n- \"Is love a recognized disability under the ADA?\"\n- \"Woman touched my face now I can't stop crying\"\n- \"Lethal dose of feelings\"\n- \"How to explain to doctor that girlfriend causes arrhythmia\"\n\nLast week you were sick. Just a cold. But you asked me to read to you and fell asleep holding my free hand, and I sat there for six hours, arm going numb, bladder screaming, reading the same page over and over because turning it might wake you. That's when I understood: I would let my arm rot off. I would let my organs fail in sequence. I would sit there until archaeology students found us, and they'd say, \"Look, he died holding her hand,\" and that would be the only autopsy that mattered.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you 237 times in my head. Different scenarios. You've cried in 41% of them. I've cried in all of them. Our hypothetical children (two, maybe three, definitely named after scientists you've never heard of) are already embarrassed by how much we love each other. I've already divorced you twice, just to practice the pain, just to prove I'd remarry you immediately, frantically, desperately, at a drive-through chapel in Vegas if necessary.\n\nI'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. I'm already married to you in every dimension that counts. This is just paperwork. Administrative follow-up. A formality to make legal what my mitochondria already know: I exist exclusively to convert oxygen into love for you.\n\nBut here, now, at 4:31 AM, with the dishwasher still clicking and my hand cramping and this letter looking like evidence of mental collapse, I need you to know: You've ruined me. Scientifically. Medically. Spiritually. Irrevocably. And I would sign up for this ruination again in every possible timeline.\n\nThe sun's coming up. You'll wake in twelve minutes (I have charts). You'll stumble in here, hair defying physics, and ask why I'm crying over chemistry equations. I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it doing that thing where you mouth the words silently. You'll get to this part and look up at me and I'll already be on my knees because I've been practicing and my success rate is only 73% without falling over.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't). Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). But because you've already colonized my entire existence and I need the paperwork to match the cellular reality. Because I've already been breathing your carbon dioxide and calling it oxygen. Because I would rather fail spectacularly at loving you than succeed at anything else that has ever been attempted by humans.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, I'm already permanently, irrevocably, molecularly yours. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. It's been there for 184 days. It's probably frozen to the fish sticks by now. This is what you've reduced me to: a man who hides jewelry with frozen food and calls it romance.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The dishwasher just stopped clicking. Even it knows this is the moment. Everything knows. The kitchen tiles. The expired milk you refuse to throw away. That spider in the corner we've named Senator Legs. They're all waiting for your answer. No pressure, but the structural integrity of the universe depends on what you say next.\n\nP.P.S. I just checked and you're definitely three days late. If you're pregnant, I've already named it. Velocity if it's a girl (after the concept, not the movie). Heisenberg if it's a boy (after the uncertainty principle that governs my entire existence now). We can negotiate, but I've already had the birth announcement cards printed. This is who you're marrying: a man who prepares for hypothetical futures with actual paperwork. God help you. God help us both.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: Migrant)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.7440, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor. 4:31 AM. The tiles are cold against my spine and I can hear you breathing through the door\u2014sixteen breaths per minute, slower when you dream about water, faster when it's your mother. I know because I've been counting for three years.\n\nYou wanted truth? I've been stealing from you. Your used coffee cups with lipstick marks. Hair from your brush\u2014317 strands, kept in dated envelopes. The pencil you chewed during your thesis defense. I'm building a museum of your DNA because I'm terrified that one day you'll realize you're dating a man who catalogs your discarded cells like evidence of God.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found me crying in the car? It wasn't work. I'd just watched you eat soup. Just\u2026 eat soup. And something about the way you blew on each spoonful\u2014this tiny hurricane of care\u2014made me understand that I would commit atrocities for you. Not metaphorically. I sat there calculating exactly which laws I'd break, which circles of hell I'd volunteer for, if it meant you'd keep blowing on soup in my vicinity forever.\n\nI need to confess something worse: I've been practicing dying. Running scenarios. Car accident\u2014last thought: the way you separate Oreos. Heart attack\u2014final image: you arguing with the self-checkout machine like it personally betrayed you. Cancer\u2014dying words: \"Tell Leyi the plants are fake.\" Because yes, I replaced your plants with artificial ones six months ago when they died, and you've been watering plastic ever since, telling them they're doing \"so much better,\" and I love you so much for that delusion that I taste metal.\n\nBefore you, I understood myself. I had boundaries. I knew where I ended. Now I'm all spillage, no container. You've liquified me. I dream in your accent. I wake up with your opinions in my mouth. Last week I defended a TV show I've never seen because you like it. My coworker said I've changed and I wanted to scream: I'VE BEEN COLONIZED. BY LOVE. BY A WOMAN WHO EATS KIT-KATS WRONG. ALL FOUR FINGERS AT ONCE LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.\n\nYou want to know what terrifies me? Sometimes when you sleep, you stop breathing for three seconds. Three seconds where the universe errors out. Three seconds where I plan your funeral, my suicide, the note I'll leave explaining that existing without you is like asking me to breathe vacuum. Then you inhale and I hate you for those three seconds of grief. I hate you and I thank whatever cosmic accident spawned you and I promise things to gods I don't believe in if they just keep you breathing.\n\nThe truth underneath my skin: I am ruined. Not romantically ruined. Medically ruined. My baseline heart rate has increased by 18 BPM since meeting you. I've developed a tremor that activates when you text. My hippocampus\u2014I looked this up\u2014has physically restructured itself around memories of you. You've given me brain damage, Leyi. Literal, measurable brain damage. And I would take more. I would let you rewire me until I'm nothing but a collection of neurons spelling your name in morse code.\n\nI bought the ring 237 days ago. I've swallowed it twice. Actually swallowed it, because you almost found it. Spent six hours in the ER, told them I was \"experimenting.\" The nurse knew. She said, \"She must be special.\" I showed her your picture. She said, \"Oh, honey. You're fucked.\" She was right.\n\nListen. I know this letter is evidence of mental illness. I know love shouldn't feel like organ failure. I know healthy people don't create spreadsheets tracking their girlfriend's microexpressions (you have forty-three distinct variations of \"annoyed,\" my favorite is #27, the nostril thing). But I don't want healthy. I want this spectacular sickness where you're the pathogen and the cure and the chronic condition I'll die from.\n\nSo I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm informing you that you've already annexed me. I'm your colony now. Your occupied territory. When archaeologists find my body they'll carbon date it to the moment you laughed at my joke about mortality and I realized I'd die for someone who finds death hilarious.\n\nI can hear you waking up. You're going to stumble in here, see me on this floor, and ask if I'm having another \"episode.\" I'll hand you this letter. You'll read it sitting on the toilet because you have no boundaries. You'll cry at the part about the plants. You'll mispronounce \"hippocampus\" when you retell this story forever. And either you'll say yes, or you'll call psychiatric services. Either way, I'm exactly where I need to be: destroyed by you, rebuilt around you, molecularly reorganized into whatever shape makes you happiest.\n\nThe sun's coming through the window now. Your shadow's under the door\u2014you're standing there, deciding whether to knock. Don't knock. Just come in. Find me here, this disaster you've made, this voluntary madness, this man who would eat glass if you said it was candy.\n\nI love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sanity, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014darker, hungrier, with teeth.\n\nMarry me. Or commit me. But know that they're the same thing now.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I just remembered\u2014last night, in your sleep, you said \"the pigeons need lawyers.\" Even your subconscious is having a better time than me. Even unconscious, you're building better realities.

I've torn up seventeen attempts because words keep failing me, but then I realized: that's the point. You've unmade my language and rebuilt it around your name.\n\nBefore you, I collected certainties like smooth stones - career trajectories, five-year plans, the careful architecture of a predictable life. You arrived and suddenly I understood why ancient cartographers wrote \"here be dragons\" at the edges of their maps. You are my beautiful unknown, my necessary chaos. With you, I've learned to love the vertigo of not knowing what comes next, only that your hand will be in mine when we meet it.\n\nI used to think love was addition - two people bringing their separate selves together. But we're not mathematics, Leyi. We're alchemy. The person I was before you seems like someone I read about in a book once, convincing but ultimately fictional. You haven't completed me; you've revealed me to myself, like a photograph developing slowly in darkroom chemicals, becoming more real with each passing moment.\n\nWhen you laugh - really laugh, not the polite sound you make at parties but the sudden, surprised joy that escapes you when something delights you - I understand why poets spend lifetimes chasing the perfect metaphor. It's the sound of morning breaking. It's my grandmother's wind chimes in a summer storm. It's the first note of a song I've been trying to remember my whole life.\n\nI love the small apostasies of you: how you eat dessert first when you're sad, how you argue with books in their margins, how you name the plants on your windowsill after historical villains (\"Napoleon needs water,\" you'll say, and somehow it's the most romantic thing I've ever heard). I love your kindness and your fury, your precision and your beautiful messes. I love the way you see through my performed confidence to the anxious boy beneath, and somehow love him too.\n\nIf I could, I would write you a letter with my whole body - my hands would tell you about the first time they touched yours and knew they'd found their purpose. My eyes would confess they've forgotten what the world looked like before it was lit by you. My lungs would explain how they've had to learn a new rhythm, one that matches your breathing when you sleep beside me.\n\nBut since I only have these insufficient words, let me say this: I choose you. Not in the past tense of a decision made, but in the continuous present of a choice I make every morning when I wake, every night when I reach for you in the darkness, every moment between. I choose your mysteries over anyone else's certainties. I choose the terror and wonder of building a life with someone who still surprises me. I choose the person I become in your presence - braver, softer, more myself than I knew was possible.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever (forever is just a word, and words keep failing me), but because I promise you this: tomorrow morning I will wake up choosing you, and the next morning, and the next. I promise to keep discovering you like you're a question I'll never stop wanting to answer. I promise to love not just who you are but who you're becoming, to make space for all your future selves, to be amazed by each transformation.\n\nYou told me you wanted truth, so here it is: I'm terrified. Not of you saying no, but of you saying yes. Because if you say yes, I'll have to become someone worthy of that yes, every single day. But Leyi - I want to be terrified with you. I want to do the impossible thing of building one life out of two. I want to fail at describing how much I love you in a thousand different languages.\n\nSay yes, and let me spend the rest of my life writing you better love letters than this one, each one trying and failing to capture what you mean to me, each failure its own kind of devotion.\n\nWith all my love and inadequate words,\nYour anxious, hopeful, eternally choosing you,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this in the bathroom at 4:16 AM because it's the only place where my hands stop shaking long enough to hold a pen. You wanted truth? Here: I've been practicing this moment for three months. Not the words\u2014the breathing. Because every time I imagine you reading this, my lungs forget their job.\n\nLet me be specific. Mathematically specific. You laugh 1.7 seconds longer at bad jokes than good ones. Your left eye closes 0.3 seconds before your right when you sneeze. You've worn the same earrings 37 times since February\u2014the small silver ones your sister gave you that you think are lucky. I know because I started counting the day I realized I was memorizing you like an exit route in a burning building.\n\nThis is what you've done: you've made me a collector of evidence. Your coffee mug leaves rings on my desk\u2014six overlapping circles that I haven't cleaned because they're proof you exist in my space. There's a dent in my pillow from where you steal it every single night while insisting you don't. Your bobby pins have colonized my apartment like small black prayers. I find them everywhere\u2014between couch cushions, behind the radiator, one inexplicably in my shoe. I keep them all in a jar. I don't know why.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You said it last Tuesday while eating cereal at midnight, milk dripping down your chin. But ordinary people don't make me google \"can you die from feeling too much\" at 2 AM. Ordinary people don't turn grocery lists into poetry. You wrote \"tomatoes (the good kind)\" and I stared at it for ten minutes because even your handwriting makes me homesick for a home that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWant to know something pathetic? I rehearse fights with you. Actual arguments, in my head, about things that haven't happened. Because I need to practice disagreeing with you without my voice cracking. Without immediately surrendering to the specific way your nose wrinkles when you're trying not to smile during an argument. You do that\u2014fight smiling. It's devastating. You've won every argument we've never had.\n\nThe truth under the truth: I'm not actually proposing. I'm confessing. That I've already built my entire life around the assumption of you. That I chose this apartment because it's three blocks from your favorite bookstore. That I learned to make your grandmother's soup from a recipe in Mandarin I translated word by word. That I wake up forty minutes early just to watch you sleep, counting the space between your breaths like rosary beads.\n\nI used to think love was expansion\u2014becoming more. But you've made me smaller, denser, like collapsed stars. All my scattered atoms pulled into the gravity of this one truth: I would rather be ordinary with you than extraordinary with anyone else. I would rather burn breakfast every Sunday for fifty years than eat perfectly alone.\n\nSo here's my proposition, and I mean that word literally\u2014a proposed position, a stance I'm taking in the universe: Marry me. Not because I deserve you (I don't) or because I promise you happiness (I can't). Marry me because I've already married you in every choice I've made since that Wednesday when you laughed so hard you snorted coffee through your nose and then laughed harder at the snorting. Marry me because my cells have already reorganized themselves around the fact of you. Because when archeologists find my bones, they'll carbon-date them to the exact moment you said my name like it meant something.\n\nI'm not good at endings. Or beginnings. I'm only good at the middle, where we already are, where I love you with the desperate precision of someone who knows exactly what he almost missed. You are my statistical impossibility, my favorite notification, my only religion.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought a ring. It's been in my sock drawer for four months. I check on it every day like it might escape. Just like I check on you sleeping every morning, still amazed you haven't realized you could do so much better.\n\nI love you. Frantically. Specifically. With annotated footnotes and cited sources. With the kind of certainty that makes me understand why people used to believe the sun revolved around the Earth\u2014because when you're in the room, everything else becomes periphery.\n\nYours (already, always, anxiously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in bed. I know you're biting your lower lip. I know because I know you, which is the only thing I've ever been sure of.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm"]}}}
