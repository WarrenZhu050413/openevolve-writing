Dear Leyi,

I'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.

*

Here it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back—before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body—there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.

*

You asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. 

Tuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.

Wednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.

Thursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.

I have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.

*

oMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word "door." Called it "the room-hole." You laughed. That sound—it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.

I've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.

*

Listen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly—car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.

But also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage—holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.

*

You know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:

Decision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: "Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me."

Decision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.

Decision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)

Decision 4-1,847: [Filed under "Evidence of Irreversibility"]

*

Here's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.

Except it's also love.

Both things. 

True things.

*

So here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.

Marry me because the alternative—a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM—isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.

*

Final truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb—desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said "that's not how brains work." I said "then you don't understand the problem."

*

Leyi.

That's the only word that matters.

Leyi.

The rest is just punctuation.

*

Say yes. Or say no. Just say something.

The silence is rearranging my organs.

(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote "There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body" and the universe started building you)

P.S. — Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.

P.P.S. — I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.
