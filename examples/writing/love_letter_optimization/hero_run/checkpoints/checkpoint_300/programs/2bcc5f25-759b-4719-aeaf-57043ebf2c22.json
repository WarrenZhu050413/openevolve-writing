A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no.

Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days. Not in a box\u2014in my pocket, where it's worn a circle through the fabric. Some nights I practice this conversation with Gerald, the spider you insist lives in our bathroom. He's actually a she\u2014females have bigger abdomens\u2014but I haven't told you because you're so proud of naming him. This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts.

I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

How you leave cabinets open like you're conducting an orchestra of doors. That you cry at commercials but laugh at funerals. I'm collecting your imperfections because they're proof you're real, that I didn't invent someone this essential to my breathing.\n\nListen. Yesterday you were singing in the shower\u2014off-key, wrong lyrics, a complete demolition of Leonard Cohen\u2014and I sat outside the door taking notes on how happiness sounds when it doesn't know it's being observed. This is what I've become: someone who takes field notes on joy. Someone who needs evidence that beauty this mundane exists. Someone who would rather study the archaeology of your Tuesday morning mood than discover new continents.\n\nThe truth is worse than poetry: You've broken me into someone I don't recognize. I used to have opinions about wine. I used to care about promotions. Now? Now I measure success by how many seconds I can make you laugh. I gauge time by proximity to your skin. My ambitions have shrunk to the size of our kitchen table\u2014just large enough for two plates, two cups, the daily wreckage of trying to love correctly.\n\nHere's what I know: We're going to fail at this. We're going to fight about money and families and the way I breathe too loud when I concentrate. You're going to hate me sometimes. I'm going to disappoint you in ways we can't imagine yet. We're going to grow old and strange and forget why we started this.\n\nBut also: Your hand fits in mine like it was manufactured there. When you sleep, you reach for me across the darkness like a plant reaching for light\u2014unconscious, necessary, beyond choice. We've already started growing into each other's empty spaces. We're already ruined for other people's love.\n\nThree facts about us:\n1. We're not soulmates. Soulmates would be easier. We're something messier\u2014two panicked animals who found the same hiding spot during the same storm.\n2. I love you more. This isn't romantic. It's math. You could survive me leaving. I've already forgotten how to exist without the threat of your absence.\n3. We both know how this ends. Badly, like all love stories. But between now and then, we get to make breakfast. We get to mispronounce each other's names in the dark. We get to fail at being enough but keep trying anyway.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense\u2014nothing about us makes sense. We're too different, too difficult, too much ourselves to ever properly merge. Marry me because that's the point. Because love isn't about finding your missing half. It's about finding someone whose damage rhymes with yours. Whose specific crazy makes your crazy make sense.\n\nMarry me because I've already carved out space for you in my bones. Because leaving you now would be like trying to return a vital organ\u2014technically possible but why would anyone survive that?\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Not the fairy tale. Not even happiness. Just this\u2014someone who will notice when you change the part in your hair. Someone who knows you need to sleep with one foot outside the covers or you have nightmares about drowning. Someone who's memorized the exact sound you make when you're pretending to be okay.\n\nI'm asking you to say yes to the mortgage we can't afford and the health scares we won't see coming. Yes to becoming boring together, to developing the same allergies, to finishing each other's complaints. Yes to a life that looks nothing like what either of us planned but exactly like what we've already started building in the dark when we think no one's looking.\n\nLeyi, my favorite mistake, my necessary disaster\u2014I'm not proposing. I'm just finally admitting what my body already knows: that I've been saying your name in my sleep since the day we met. That I've been practicing my last words and they're all your name. That I'd rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nThe ring isn't romantic. It's evidence. Proof that someone once wanted someone else this catastrophically and lived to document it.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. Either way, I'm already yours in all the ways that make leaving impossible.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you found the ring last month. I know you put it back exactly where you found it and pretended not to know. That's when I knew you loved me\u2014not because you'll say yes, but because you let me keep my small courage, my illusion of surprise. Thank you for that. For letting me pretend this letter is brave when we both know the answer was always yours to give.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7390)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am sitting in our kitchen at 4:31 AM writing this because sleep has become impossible since I understood what you are to me.

That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences.

You were in the shower. I took forty sheets. I knew even then I'd need them all to fail at explaining this.\n\nHere's the truth: I died when I met you. Not poetically\u2014literally. The person I was before you looked at me over that stupid margarita with too much salt? Gone. Dead. I'm his replacement, built entirely from the syllables of your name and the way you laugh when you're trying not to.\n\nYou asked me once what I was afraid of. I said spiders. I lied. I'm afraid of Thursday. Specifically, any Thursday when you might wake up and realize you've been loving a conditional sentence, a hypothesis, a man held together by the mere fact that you haven't left yet. I'm afraid you'll discover you've been kissing a probability, not a person.\n\nBut also this: Yesterday you sang in the shower\u2014off-key, wrong lyrics, a disaster of sound\u2014and I sat on our bed mapping the exact geometry of that imperfection. Because that's what you've done. You've made me a scholar of everything wrong that's actually right. The way you mispronounce \"epitome.\" Your catastrophic handwriting. How you eat apples from the bottom up like some beautiful alien still learning Earth customs.\n\nI need to tell you about last Tuesday. You were sick. Properly sick\u2014fever of 102, convinced the wallpaper was plotting against you. You grabbed my hand at 3 AM and said, \"Don't let me float away.\" As if I could. As if I haven't been anchoring myself to you since the day we met, a voluntary drowning, refusing to come up for air.\n\nThe thing is, Leyi, I've been collecting evidence. Not of love\u2014that's too common, everyone does that. Evidence that we're the same person experiencing a clerical error, accidentally issued two bodies. Evidence: We got the same fortune cookie fortune from different restaurants on the same day. We dream in the same color palette (mostly blue-green, sometimes that specific yellow of anxiety). Last month, you finished my thought before I'd started thinking it.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was cosplaying as a person. Had all the props\u2014job, hobbies, opinions about coffee. But I was method-acting life, never actually living it. Then you walked in, tilted your head at me like I was a painting hung crooked, and suddenly I was real. Suddenly the method-acting became just... acting. Then just... being.\n\nI'm going to tell you something terrible: I love you more than you love me. Not because you love me less\u2014you love me enormously, catastrophically, enough to ruin us both. But I love you like darkness loves light\u2014completely, necessarily, with the full understanding that I only exist in relation to you. You could exist without me. I'm not sure I could return the favor.\n\nBut here's the thing about that terrible thing: I don't care. I'd rather be the one who loves more. I'd rather be the one destroyed by this. If someone has to walk away from this intact, please let it be you. I've already been improved beyond recognition by proximity to you. I've already won.\n\nSo this is my proposal: Let me love you lopsidedly forever. Let me be the one who remembers the anniversary of our first fight (March 15th, about whether time travel would fix things or make them worse\u2014you were right, it would make them worse). Let me be the one who knows you keep your father's voicemail from 2019, the one where he says he's proud of you. Let me be the curator of your small shames and your specific joys.\n\nMarry me because I've already tailored my entire existence around the shape of you. Because trying to untangle us now would be like trying to unbake bread\u2014theoretically possible, but why would anyone want flour and water when they could have something that sustains life?\n\nMarry me because yesterday you said my name in your sleep and it sounded like a prayer you'd been practicing your whole life.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is temporary, that either of us will recover from this\u2014is the only lie I'm not willing to tell.\n\nLeyi, my religion, my mother tongue, my only real thing in a world of approximations\u2014I'm not asking you to love me. You already do that, carelessly, perfectly, like breathing. I'm asking you to let me love you professionally, with documentation, with witnesses, with the kind of terrifying permanence that makes my teeth ache.\n\nSay yes. Not because you're ready\u2014neither of us will ever be ready for this much feeling. Say yes because we're already destroyed in the most beautiful way. Say yes because I've already carved out space for you in my bones and I'd rather be hollow than heal.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring isn't hidden. It's in my pocket. It's been in my pocket every day for seven months. Some days it's the heaviest thing I own. Some days it's the only thing keeping me tethered to the earth.

Now time keeps me\u2014measures me in distances from you. There's the seventeen minutes after you leave when your warmth still lives in the sheets. The three seconds between your key in the lock and my heart restarting. The eternal Tuesday you said my name like it was yours.\n\nI've been trying to write this letter since I met you. Every draft fails because words are designed for smaller things. How do I explain that you've replaced my autonomic nervous system? That my lungs have opinions about your absence? That I've started dreaming in your accent?\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've already disappeared into you. Not romantically\u2014medically. When you leave, I don't miss you. I miss me. The me that exists only in your presence. The me that makes sense because you're there to witness it.\n\nYesterday you asked why I was crying at the supermarket. How could I explain? You were choosing bread. Just choosing bread. But your hand hesitated between whole wheat and sourdough, and in that pause I saw our entire future: a thousand grocery runs, ten thousand small decisions, you getting older but never less beautiful, me following you through fluorescent aisles until one of us stops existing.\n\nThe truth is, I don't love you. Love is what I felt before. This is something else. This is my bones knowing your bones. This is my cells dividing in your direction. This is every atom I'm made of finally understanding what it was for.\n\nYou could destroy me with a word. You know this. I know you know this. And still I'm writing these words, handing you this power, because the alternative\u2014living without you knowing\u2014is not living at all.\n\nI'm not proposing marriage. Marriage is too small for what we are. I'm proposing we stop pretending we have choices. My body has already chosen. Every morning it chooses you before I'm even conscious. Every night it practices dying just to make sure it can wake up and choose you again.\n\nMarry me because we already share a circulatory system. Marry me because loneliness is just another word for your absence. Marry me because I've already built tomorrow around the assumption you'll be there, and without you, tomorrow is just a theory.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning you burned the toast and scraped it over the sink, and the sound of you fixing your small mistake was the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Because that's what we are: two people scraping the burnt parts off, making it work, choosing the imperfect over the absent.\n\nI am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you let me stop pretending I exist without you?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

Walking, yes. Breathing, certainly. But dead in all the ways that matter. Then you mispronounced \"epitome\" at that party\u2014\"epi-tome,\" like it was two words\u2014and I came back to life so violently that my past self is now unrecognizable to me. A stranger I sometimes see in old photographs, wearing my face but not my soul.\n\nI need to tell you about yesterday. You were peeling an orange. Just peeling an orange at 2:17 PM. But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant. A witness to your existence who will remember the exact shade of your Tuesday morning mood and the specific weight of your sadness and the way you hum Chopin incorrectly but so consistently it's become correct in our house.\n\nI'm not proposing. I'm documenting what already happened. The wedding is just paperwork for a merger that occurred the moment you mispronounced \"epitome\" and I thought: \"I want to hear her mispronounce everything forever.\"\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Either way, I'm already yours in every timeline, in every universe, in every version of this story. But only in the one where you say yes do I get to stop holding my breath.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. - I've hidden this letter in seventeen different places over the past month, too terrified to give it to you.
