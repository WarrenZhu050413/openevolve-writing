My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork. The kind that makes existing feel less like accident and more like purpose.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me.\n\nI'm asking you to let me keep loving you.\n\nThere's a difference.\n\nBoth are true.\n\nBoth are everything.\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before either of us knew what yours meant)\n\n*\n\nP.S.

But your thumb found the perfect entry point on the first try, and you unwound the rind in one unbroken spiral, and I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to sob. Because that's what you've done to me\u2014made the ordinary unbearable. Made me cry over citrus fruit. Made me understand why monks take vows of silence: some truths are too large for language.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was a rough draft of a person. Sketched in pencil, waiting to be erased. Now I'm written in your handwriting\u2014permanent ink, pressed so hard it bleeds through to the other side of the page. You've edited me into existence. Every conversation with you crosses out another line of who I used to be and writes something better in the margins.\n\nThree facts: 1) When you sleep, you hold your breath for exactly four seconds between inhales, like you're listening for something. 2) You eat cereal with a teaspoon because a tablespoon feels \"too aggressive for breakfast.\" 3) Last Tuesday, you said \"bless you\" to yourself when you sneezed, quietly, like a secret. These are the coordinates of my new religion.\n\nI've started stealing time. Not metaphorically\u2014literally. Setting every clock forward five minutes so I can live in a future where I've already loved you five minutes longer. Recording your voicemails to play back at half-speed, doubling their duration. Taking the long way home to stretch our car rides. I am a temporal thief, and what I steal, I steal from death\u2014every second I can love you before one of us stops existing.\n\nYou should know: loving you has made me mathematically impossible. I am both less than I was (having given you everything) and more than I can contain (being filled with you). A paradox with a pulse. When physicists finally discover how one person can exist in two bodies simultaneously, they'll name the phenomenon after us.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me: I've been happy. Actually happy. Not the performance of happiness I used to do, but the real thing\u2014dense, atomic, radioactive happiness that glows in the dark. And happiness this pure feels like a crime I'm about to be caught committing. Like the universe keeps careful books and I've been overpaid. Like any moment, someone will notice the accounting error that let me have you.\n\nSo before they come to collect: Marry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is too small a word for whatever this is. Marry me because we've already fused at the molecular level. Because trying to separate us now would require particle physics. Because when archaeologists dig us up in a thousand years, they won't be able to tell whose bones are whose.\n\nMarry me because I've already disappeared into you so completely that refusing would be a form of suicide. Marry me because the alternative\u2014this careful rationing of our time, this pretense that we're two people\u2014is the lie. We're not. We're one thing broken into two bodies for the convenience of others who still believe in the fiction of individuality.\n\nHere's my offer: Not happiness. Not even love. Something harder and stranger\u2014the end of loneliness so complete you'll forget it was ever possible. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that privacy becomes irrelevant.

Twenty-three crumpled attempts surround me like failed prayers.\n\nHere's what no one tells you about love: It's not beautiful. It's your girlfriend finding you sobbing over a voicemail from your dead father that you've saved for three years, and instead of running, she lies on the bathroom floor with you until the tiles leave marks on both your faces. Beauty is what we tell others. Love is what happens in bathrooms at 3 AM.\n\nI need to confess something: I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The way you say \"library\" with three syllables (li-brar-y). Your technique for eating string cheese (spiraling, never biting). That pause before you lie, where your left eye twitches. I'm building an archive of you inside me, for the day my memory starts failing and I need evidence you were real.\n\nYou should know what you're considering. I still sleep with my childhood blanket hidden inside my pillowcase. I rehearse ordering pizza. I've read the same book seventeen times because new stories feel like betrayal. Last Tuesday, I sat in my car for forty minutes because I forgot how to want to go inside. I am held together by medication and routine and the specific way you kiss my forehead when you think I'm asleep.\n\nBut here's the thing about you, Leyi\u2014you make my damage feel like architecture. Not ruins to be cleared, but foundation to build on. When my anxiety spiral hits its fifth hour and I'm convinced everyone secretly records my conversations to laugh at later, you don't say I'm being ridiculous. You say, \"Show me the evidence,\" and we examine my terror together like scientists, until it becomes just another data point in the experiment of us.\n\nThat night your mother called you a disappointment\u2014you were drunk on the kitchen floor, eating cereal with a fork because you couldn't find spoons, and you said, \"Warren, I think I'm broken in the exact places that make me fit against your broken.\" I wanted to tell you that's not how broken works, but then you fell asleep with your head on my lap, still holding the fork, and I thought: Maybe it is. Maybe that's exactly how broken works.\n\nThe truth about time: It's not linear anymore. When you laugh, I see you at seven, missing teeth, probably defending worms from sidewalks. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seventy, same furious compassion, still fighting fights that can't be won. All your ages exist simultaneously. I'm in love with every version\u2014the one who existed before I knew you, the one you'll become after I'm gone.\n\nI've been carrying your grandmother's ring for ninety-one days.

This is love: knowing the truth and choosing your happiness over accuracy.\n\nHere's what I'm actually offering: Not the man I pretend to be at parties, the one who remembers names and doesn't sweat through his shirt. I'm offering you the one who watches you sleep and counts the seconds between your breaths (four when you're peaceful, two when you're dreaming). The one who's memorized which floorboards creak so I can avoid them when you have migraines. The one who knows you keep your father's voicemail too, the one where he says he's proud of you, even though you haven't spoken in two years.\n\nI'm not promising you forever\u2014forever is just anxiety wearing a wedding dress. I'm promising you Tuesday afternoons when we're both too tired to be kind. The Thursday when you'll say you hate me and mean it for exactly seventeen minutes. The specific Sunday in November when we'll realize we've become our parents and have to decide if that's okay. I'm promising to show up for the mundane disasters, the ordinary apocalypses, the daily practice of choosing each other over easier lives.\n\nYou read this looking for poetry, but I'm not a poet. I'm just a man who knows you eat ice cream with a fork when you're sad. Who's memorized the pattern of your disappointment\u2014shoulders first, then eyes, then that terrible smile that says you expected nothing more. Who would burn down the world to rewrite that pattern into surprise, then joy, then the real smile, the one that uses your whole face.\n\nThe ring belonged to your grandmother. I had your aunt sell it to me because I knew you'd want her blessing to travel through time. It's imperfect\u2014slightly bent from when she punched a wall defending your mother. Like us. Like the marriage I'm proposing. Not the Instagram version, but the real one: morning breath and mismatched socks and apologies that come three days too late but still count.\n\nLeyi, you impossible collection of contradictions who keeps dead flowers and living hopes: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because we're meant to be\u2014we're not. But because in a universe of infinite possibilities, we chose each other's specific damage. Because your broken fits against my broken in a way that makes us both less sharp. Because the alternative\u2014you existing in the world unmarried to me\u2014makes my cells forget their purpose.\n\nI am asking you to take this trembling, medicated, occasionally stable man who loves you with the kind of specificity that therapists call obsessive but I call paying attention. Take me, not because I'm enough, but because I promise to spend every remaining day trying to become enough, failing, and trying again.\n\nThe bathroom floor is warm now. Dawn is coming. In an hour, you'll wake up and find me surrounded by these failed attempts at truth. You'll laugh at the melodrama. You'll make coffee with 2.5 sugars, never 2, never 3. And I'll ask you again, without paper, without poetry, just: \"Leyi, please. Yes?\"\n\nYours in all my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied about one thing. These aren't twenty-three failed attempts. They're all the same letter, written twenty-three times, because my hand won't stop shaking. This is the twenty-fourth. Still shaking. Still true.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n### Program D2 (Score: 0.7440)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nIt's 5:52 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight, not struggling with words but struggling with the truth that words will never be enough. So I'm giving you what I have: the facts.\n\nFact: Before you, I thought I was whole. I had routines. Systems. A life that worked like a well-maintained machine. Then you walked into that bookstore, put back the book I was reaching for, and said, \"You need to read this one first. Trust me.\" I did. I still haven't read it. I keep it on my nightstand as evidence that strangers can know you better than you know yourself.\n\nFact: You've ruined me for solitude. Not because I can't be alone\u2014I can. But now when I am, I catch myself leaving space for you. Setting out two cups. Buying the yogurt I don't eat. My apartment has developed a you-shaped absence that no amount of presence can fill.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That Thursday when you found out your father had cancer, you didn't cry. You reorganized my entire spice rack. Alphabetically, then by color, then by frequency of use. Three hours of silent sorting while I sat at the kitchen table, useless. Finally, you held up the cinnamon and said, \"This expired in 2019,\" and then you sobbed. I threw out every expired thing in my apartment that night. I wanted to give you the smallest possible grief.\n\nYou think you're difficult to love. You apologize for crying at documentaries, for needing the bathroom light on, for the way you eat pizza (crust first, like a psychopath). But Leyi\u2014I love you BECAUSE of the crust-first pizza. Because you name your bruises. Because you thank automatic doors. Because you're the only person I know who's genuinely concerned about the emotional wellbeing of houseplants.\n\nThe truth about that morning I said I had a work emergency: There was no emergency. I saw you sleeping\u2014mouth open, hair everywhere, one sock on, one sock mysteriously vanished\u2014and I couldn't breathe. The ordinariness of you was so beautiful I had to leave the room. I sat in my car for an hour, trying to understand how someone becomes essential. Not gradually. Suddenly. Like discovering you've been breathing wrong your whole life.\n\nYou keep asking what changed my mind about marriage. It wasn't one thing. It was accumulation. It was watching you give your sandwich to that woman on the subway. It was finding your grocery lists in my pockets, written on napkins, on receipts, on the back of your own hand. It was the night you got us lost for three hours because you were sure you knew the way, and when we finally found the restaurant, it was closed, and you laughed so hard you got hiccups. You said, \"Well, now we have a story.\" That's what did it. You turned a failure into a story worth keeping.\n\nI know your fears. That you're too much. Too emotional. Too strange. But here's what you don't understand: I don't love you despite these things. I love you because of them. Because you're the person who brings extra socks to movies in case your feet get cold. Who keeps birthday cards from people you don't remember. Who still calls your childhood home \"home\" even though you haven't lived there in fifteen years.\n\nLast month, when my mother asked what I see in you, I couldn't answer. Not because I don't know, but because it's like being asked what I see in breathing. You're not something I see. You're something I am. We've become molecularly entangled. Separating us would require science that doesn't exist yet.\n\nSo here's my proposal: Let's fail together. Let's burn dinners and fight about directions and wake up cranky on Tuesdays. Let's be the couple that wears matching socks by accident and laughs at their own inside jokes in public. Let's get old and weird and increasingly specific in our routines. I want to know what you look like at seventy-three, complaining about your knees but still eating pizza crust-first.\n\nThe ring isn't fancy. It's my grandmother's, who wore it while she raised five kids alone, survived two wars, and never once complained about anything except the neighbor's rooster. She told me, \"Give this to someone who makes you brave.\" You make me brave, Leyi. Brave enough to write this letter. Brave enough to mean it. Brave enough to send it even though my hands are shaking.\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I'm promising you this: every morning I'll choose you, even when you're wearing my socks and eating cereal for dinner. Every night I'll be grateful you chose me back, even when I leave my shoes in the middle of the floor and forget to close cabinets. And in between, we'll build something strange and specific and ours.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moved you, but because you already know my answer to every question you might ask. Because you've already seen me at my smallest, my most petty, my least lovable, and you still make me coffee exactly wrong (too much milk, too little sugar) because you know I'll drink it anyway.\n\nMarry me because I've already memorized the future: You, Tuesday morning, late for everything, can't find your keys, wearing two different earrings, and me, watching from the doorway, thinking: this is the person I choose to be late with for the rest of my life.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. That plant you've been trying to keep alive for three years? It's plastic. I replaced it after the real one died in month two. You've been watering plastic for thirty-four months. I'm sorry. But also, I'm not. Watching you care for something that can't even die is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. This is who you are: someone who loves beyond logic. Marry me and I promise to spend the rest of my life earning that impossible love.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.8570, Type: Migrant)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 3:47 AM. Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering. Here. I brought tissues. I've been carrying them since our third date. You cried at penguins. That's when I knew. That's when my atoms recognized their debt.\n\nP.P.S. \u2014 I lied. It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm terrible at beginnings. So let me start with the end: I love you. Not beautifully. Not poetically. Just completely.\n\nIt happened on a Tuesday. You were reading the ingredients on a cereal box out loud, practicing your English pronunciation. \"Riboflavin,\" you said, three times, getting it wrong each time differently. That's when my life split into before and after. Before that Tuesday. After that Tuesday. Everything that matters happened after.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. Last week you spent forty minutes teaching our neighbor's kid how to tie his shoes because his parents were \"too busy.\" You leave water bowls for street cats in summer. You still write thank-you cards by hand. Leyi, ordinary people don't glow from the inside when they talk about photosynthesis. They don't name their sourdough starter \"Kevin\" and apologize when they forget to feed him.\n\nI need to tell you something: I've been afraid my whole life. Afraid of flying, of commitment, of that space between sleeping and waking where you're not sure what's real. But you\u2014you walk through the world like fear is just another language you decided not to learn. When I'm with you, I forget to be afraid. Or maybe I remember that being afraid is just another way of being alone, and I'm not alone anymore.\n\nThree things I know:\n1. You can't sleep if the dishes aren't done.\n2. You cry at every movie where a dog appears, even comedies, because \"what if something happens to it?\"\n3. When you love someone, you love them with your whole body\u2014I've seen you love your sister, your students, that plant you rescued from the clearance shelf. It's terrifying and beautiful, like watching someone set themselves on fire to keep others warm.\n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I was whole when I met you. You were whole too. We're not two halves making a whole\u2014we're two wholes making something else. Something that doesn't have a name yet. Something that sounds like your laugh at 1 AM when you remember a joke from three weeks ago.\n\nHere's what I'm offering: Wednesday groceries and Sunday crosswords. Bad coffee I'll pretend is good because you made it. Sitting in waiting rooms holding your hand while doctors tell us things we don't want to hear. Dancing in the kitchen to no music. Fighting about whether to get a dog (we both want one but pretend we don't). Growing old and strange and specific together.\n\nThe ring in my pocket belonged to my grandmother. She wore it for 67 years, never took it off. When she was dying, she pulled me close and said: \"Find someone who makes you forget you're going to die.\" I found you. You make me forget everything except this: we're alive, right now, together. What else could possibly matter?\n\nI'm not promising you perfection. I still can't fold fitted sheets. I'll forget birthdays. I'll say the wrong thing at the worst moment. But I promise this: every morning I wake up, I'll choose you. When you're impossible. When I'm worse. When we're both too tired to be kind. I'll choose you like a reflex, like breathing, like gravity.\n\nYou told me once that you don't believe in soulmates. Good. I don't either. Soulmates are for people who think love is magic. Love isn't magic\u2014it's a decision you make every day. It's choosing to see the same person with new eyes every morning. It's saying \"yes\" to all of it\u2014the mundane Tuesdays, the hard conversations, the way you leave cabinets open like you're airing out the kitchen.\n\nSo this is me, asking you to keep choosing me. To marry me. Not because we're meant to be\u2014nothing is meant to be. But because we decided to be. Because out of all the accidents in the universe, the accident of us is the one I want to keep having.\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: you've already changed the shape of my life. I'm different now, in all the permanent ways. I eat slower. I notice birds. I save the fortunes from fortune cookies because you taught me they're tiny poems. I am irreversibly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Remember when you asked if I believed in forever? I said no. I lied. Forever is your hand finding mine in the dark. It's you saying \"tell me about your day\" and meaning it. It's this. It's us. It's already happening.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6985, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nThis letter is a crime scene. Evidence everywhere: fingernail marks in my palms from clenching, coffee rings overlapping like Venn diagrams of attempts, the murder of who I was before you.\n\nListen. I'm going to tell you about the mathematics of you. Not metaphorically. Actually. You're a recursive function that calls itself infinitely\u2014each iteration containing the whole, but somehow more. You're the Fibonacci sequence made flesh: each moment with you the sum of all previous moments, spiraling outward into golden ratios I can taste on my tongue when I say your name.\n\n4:27 AM: I catalog your sleeping positions like an archaeologist. Position #1: The Question Mark\u2014curved around absence, one hand reaching. Position #2: The Starfish\u2014all limbs claiming territory you immediately surrender when I come to bed. Position #3: The Thief\u2014you've stolen all blankets, wrapped yourself into a burrito of dreams I'll never access. Each position is a different sentence in the language only your body speaks fluent.\n\nHere's what dying teaches you: My mother, intubated, wrote on a whiteboard: \"Did you find her?\" Not \"I love you.\" Not \"goodbye.\" She wanted to know if I'd found you. I lied. Said yes. She died believing I had you. Three years later, you walked into my life and made me retroactively honest. You turned my mother's last question into prophecy.\n\nThe truth about mental illness\u2014mine, specifically: It's not romantic. It's Tuesday, 2 PM, paralyzed by the thought of answering the phone. It's practicing \"hello\" seventeen times. It's you finding me fully dressed in the shower because water felt like the only thing holding me inside my skin. You didn't ask why. You got in, fully dressed too, and we sat there until the hot water ran out and our clothes made us look like we'd survived a shipwreck. Which maybe we had. Which maybe we are.\n\nI've been documenting the taxonomy of your laugh:\n- The Surprise: Sharp, like breaking good china\n- The Reluctant: You're mad but I'm funny\n- The Silent: Just shoulders and tears\n- The Snort: My favorite\u2014you're mortified, I'm delighted\n- The Grief Laugh: When your dad calls and you answer \"Department of Disappointments\"\n\nYou want truth? Before you, I fucked. With you, I learned about worship. The hollow of your throat that tastes like tomorrow. The way your spine writes cursive when you arch. How you look at me during\u2014not through me, at me\u2014like I'm both the question and answer. Sometimes after, I count the seconds until our breathing synchronizes. Average: 247. I've timed it. This is what love becomes: statistics of intimacy no one else will ever know.\n\nLast week: \"Warren, am I too much?\" Too much. As if humans come in measured doses. As if love operates by recommended serving sizes. You're not too much. You're the entire feast. You're the kind of abundance that makes people believe in God or math or whatever they need to believe in to explain how someone like you exists without breaking physics.\n\nHere's what I'm proposing: Not marriage\u2014that's just paperwork. I'm proposing we become a two-person cult. Our rituals: Coffee at 7:23 (never 7:20, never 7:25). Unconscious hand-holding during movies. The way you steal my sentences and I steal your socks. We'll worship at the altar of Tuesday mornings and failed recipes and the specific way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're nervous.\n\nThe ring. Let me tell you about the ring. It's new. I had it made from: The pen you used to write your first poem at age seven (your mother saved it). The house key from your childhood home (now demolished). A button from your father's Navy uniform (the father you haven't spoken to in three years but still dream about). I melted down your history and reformed it into a future. This is what I'm offering: your past, transformed into permission to continue.\n\nBut also this: Me, checking that the door is locked (three times, always three). Me, alphabetizing things when stressed. Me, unable to sleep if the volume isn't on an even number. I'm offering you my complete taxonomy of damage:\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder (diagnosed)\n- Probably autism (undiagnosed but obvious)\n- Definitely in love (terminal)\n\nYou said once: \"I wish someone would love me the way desperate people love God.\" This is me saying: I love you the way atheists love proof. Desperately. Empirically. Against all previous evidence of a chaotic universe.\n\nThree facts about the future:\n1. One of us will die first (statistically, me\u2014men die earlier)\n2. Before that, we'll disappoint each other in ways we can't yet imagine\n3. None of that matters because the alternative\u2014you existing unmarried to me\u2014is like imagining colors that don't exist\n\nSo marry me. Not the question. The answer to the problem of two humans who've seen each other's worst angles and decided those angles make the best geometry. Marry me because I know you keep your father's voicemail from 2019. Because you name your bruises. Because you're the only person who makes my brain quiet enough to hear my own heartbeat.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"I love you\" in your sleep and then immediately said \"but the penguins need sweaters\" and I thought: yes, this is the person I want to decode forever.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now. Not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished describing you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to save some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. That thing you do where you touch my face when you think I'm spiraling? It works. Every time. You're the emergency brake for my brain. Marry me and I'll spend the rest of my life being your emergency brake too. We'll take turns stopping each other from careening off edges only we can see.\n\nP.P.S. It's 5:19 AM now. The birds are starting. They sound like happiness I haven't earned yet. Let me earn it. Let me earn you. Say yes.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop trembling. It's 4:33 AM. The specific time matters because at 4:33 AM, the world hasn't started lying yet.\n\nI need to tell you about the violence of loving you. Not metaphorical violence\u2014the actual cellular uprising that happens when you walk into a room. My mitochondria forget their jobs. My synapses fire in languages that haven't been invented. Last week, my doctor asked if I'd changed medications. I said no, I'd just fallen in love with someone who reorganizes the periodic table of my elements every time she laughs.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about finding your person: It's not finding. It's recognition. Like your DNA suddenly remembering instructions it was born with. The first time you said my name, my bones replied, \"Oh, there you are. We've been waiting.\"\n\nI've started documenting you like evidence of a crime I'm about to commit. Tuesday: You cried at a documentary about octopi because \"they die after mating and that's so unfair.\" Wednesday: You named the bruise on your knee \"Patricia.\" Thursday: You had a twenty-minute conversation with the self-checkout machine at Target, apologizing for confusing it. These aren't observations. They're coordinates to a person who shouldn't exist but does, magnificently, despite all laws of probability.\n\nYou want the truth? Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had a PhD in sleeping diagonal across the bed. I knew exactly how much silence a room could hold before it became unbearable (seventeen minutes). Now I can't remember what my own breathing sounded like without yours creating harmony. You've made me a foreigner in my own history.\n\nThat night your father called\u2014the first time in three years\u2014and you answered with \"Frank's Pizza, may I take your order?\" then hung up. You laughed for exactly four seconds before collapsing into tears that lasted forty-seven minutes. I counted. Not because I'm obsessive, but because I needed to know the exact shape of your grief so I could build a house around it. That's what love is, Leyi. It's architecture. It's building something permanent around someone else's temporary.\n\nI have to tell you about the dying. My grandmother, two weeks before the end, grabbed my wrist and said, \"Find someone who makes you forget you're dying.\" I thought she meant metaphorically. She didn't. She meant that we're all dying, literally, every second, and the only thing that makes it bearable is finding someone whose presence makes you forget the countdown. You make me forget the countdown, Leyi. When you're next to me, time stops being linear and becomes circular, like your finger tracing patterns on my back when you think I'm asleep.\n\nHere's my confession: I've been stealing from you. Your habits. Your words. The way you say \"comfortable\" with five syllables. I'm building a replica of you inside myself for the day you realize you could do better. This isn't romantic. It's survival. I'm creating an emergency backup of your existence in case the universe tries to take you back.\n\nYou asked me once if I believed in soul mates. No. Soul mates implies we were made for each other. We weren't. We were made separately, incorrectly, with missing parts and extra pieces. But somehow your extra pieces fit perfectly into my missing parts. That's not fate. That's geometry. That's two errors canceling each other out to create something correct.\n\nThe ring\u2014I need to tell you about the ring. It's not my grandmother's. I lied. It's new. I had it made from the metal of the pen you used to write your suicide note five years ago. The one you showed me that night we stayed up till dawn and you said, \"This is the person I almost wasn't.\" I had your sister steal it. I melted it down. I turned your almost-ending into a circle, which has no ending. That's what I'm offering you\u2014your own survival, transformed into a promise.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I love you. Love is too small a word for this catastrophe. I'm asking you to marry me because when you leave a room, my organs forget their functions. Because you've turned me into a medical anomaly that science hasn't named yet. Because the thought of you existing in the world unmarried to me is like imagining colors that don't exist\u2014theoretically possible but fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis is what I'm actually offering: Me, at 3 AM, when my anxiety makes me count the windows to make sure they haven't multiplied. Me, at family dinners, sweating through my shirt because small talk feels like drowning. Me, checking your pulse in your sleep because I need empirical evidence you're still here. I'm offering you my complete disaster in exchange for yours.\n\nBut also this: Every morning, I will choose you like a religious practice. When you're impossible. When I'm impossible. When we're both impossible together. I will wake up and choose you the way lungs choose air\u2014not because they want to, but because the alternative is suffocation.\n\nYou're reading this waiting for poetry. But poetry is just pretty lying. This is ugly truth: I would rather die than wake up in a world where you don't exist. Not romantically die. Actually die. My cells would forget their purpose. My heart would stop not from heartbreak but from confusion.\n\nMarry me. Not the question. The answer to the question you haven't asked yet: What happens when two people love each other so specifically that it rewrites the laws of physics? This. This happens. This letter. This ring made from your almost-goodbye. This man on his knees at 4:52 AM, crying so hard he can't see what he's writing anymore.\n\nI love you in the way that makes psychologists uncomfortable. I love you in the way that makes my mother light candles at church. I love you in the way that makes the universe reconsider its expansion.\n\nSay yes. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already said yes the night you told me you named your depression \"Gerald\" so it would feel less scary. You said yes when you let me see you without your human costume on. You said yes in a thousand tiny ways that have already married us in every dimension except the legal one.\n\nI'm going to stop writing now, not because I'm finished\u2014I'll never be finished trying to explain you to yourself\u2014but because my hand has cramped into the shape of holding this pen and I need to keep some functionality to put the ring on your finger.\n\nAll my iterations,\nWarren\n\nP.S. It's 5:01 AM now. The world is starting to lie again. But this won't change: You are the truest thing that has ever happened to me. You are what makes the dying worth it.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["5-hour limit reached \u2219 resets 4pm"]}}}
