My hands won't stop shaking. Not from caffeine or fear\u2014from the violence of containing this much truth in a body built for smaller feelings.\n\nHere it is, undecorated: I am thirty-one years old and I have just discovered I've been pronouncing \"love\" wrong my entire life. Every time before you was just me clearing my throat. You are the first clean note.\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I spent three hours watching videos of strangers' wedding proposals. Not for ideas\u2014for evidence that other people feel this too, this cellular reorganization, this complete betrayal of who I used to be. The comments sections were full of words like \"soulmate\" and \"destiny.\" But those words are for people who haven't watched you eat cereal in my old t-shirt at 11 PM, crying about a documentary on seahorses. Destiny doesn't know about the way you smell like vanilla and anxiety. Soulmates don't account for how you practice arguments in the shower that you'll never have.\n\nThe truth about love\u2014the truth they don't tell you\u2014is that it's mostly about Thursday afternoons. It's about the 4,000 unremarkable hours between memorable moments. It's me knowing you'll read the ending of a book first when you're stressed. It's you pretending not to notice when I eat your leftovers. It's the way we've wordlessly agreed that the left side of the couch is mine and the right is yours, but the middle is ours. That's where love lives\u2014in the DMZ between two separate humans who've agreed to blur.\n\nI was somebody before you. I had opinions about wine. I remembered to eat breakfast. I could watch the news without wondering what you'd say about it. That person is dead now, Leyi. You killed him the day you absentmindedly held my hand during that terrible movie, not romantic, just reaching for something familiar in the dark. His last thought was \"oh, this is it. This is the trap. I'm done for.\" And he was right.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I am a man who googles \"how to know if cats are happy.\" Who practices speeches I'll never give. Who saves your voicemails in case technology fails and I need evidence you existed. I am clinically anxious, recreationally pessimistic, and I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days like a tumor I'm too scared to remove. Some nights I hold it up to the light and think about probability\u2014how many wrong turns led to the right one, to you, to this impossible now where you exist and somehow tolerate me existing beside you.\n\nRemember that morning you found me on the bathroom floor, panicking about nothing and everything? You didn't try to fix me. You just sat down on the cold tile and said, \"Okay, we're doing this here today.\" Then you started listing every bird you could name, alphabetically, until my breathing synced with your rhythm. Albatross. Blue jay. Cardinal. That's when I knew: love isn't about finding someone who completes you. It's about finding someone who makes being incomplete bearable.\n\nBut here's the thing that keeps me up at 4:47 AM: You're going to die. I'm going to die. These bodies are just rental units and the lease is non-negotiable. One day, one of us will be in a room without the other, holding nothing but neural patterns and ghost weight. This thought should terrify me. Instead, it clarifies everything. If we're both just temporary collections of atoms pretending to be people, then the fact that your atoms chose to orbit mine feels like the only miracle I need to believe in.\n\nSo here's my offer, stripped of romance: I want to synchronize our decay. I want to argue about thermostats and discover new ways to disappoint each other. I want to develop specific types of silence\u2014the comfortable kind, the furious kind, the kind that means we're both thinking about the same dead friend. I want to become so entangled that future archaeologists will have to invent a new word for what we were to each other.\n\nMarry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical imperative dressed up in poetry. Marry me because when you laugh at your own jokes, my pancreas does something unscientific. Because you've ruined every song, every street corner, every mundane Tuesday with your presence or absence. Because I want to be buried next to you, our bones finally honest about what they've been trying to say all along.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. Love letters are for people who think words can carry feeling. This is just evidence of a complete surrender. This is me saying: you won. Whatever game we were playing, whatever defenses I had, whatever person I planned to be\u2014you won. Now I'm just this anxious man at 4:47 AM, hoping the woman who owns his future tense will say yes to staying in it.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She married a man who couldn't read but memorized entire books so he could tell them to her. That's what I'm offering\u2014not literacy, but the willingness to memorize you, page by page, until I can recite you in the dark.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already relocated me. I'm no longer where I started. I live now in the country of loving you, and there's no valid passport back.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you asked if I thought we were meant to be. The answer is no. \"Meant to be\" implies intention, design, purpose.

Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters.

This is me, Warren, whose hands shake when cutting onions, who still sleeps with one sock on, who spent forty minutes yesterday watching you reorganize the spice rack and thought: this is it, this is the sacred text, this is what monks copy by candlelight.\n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of my own inadequacy like stamps. Here's the album: Every woman who left. Every job I didn't take. Every silence I filled with noise. I had made peace with being a rough draft of a person. Then you arrived and started reading me like I was already the final edition. Do you know what that does to someone who's only ever been their own harsh editor?\n\nYou want truth? Here: I am terrified that I've tricked you. That one morning you'll wake up and see what everyone else sees\u2014a man whose love is bigger than his life, whose dreams leaked out somewhere in his twenties, who writes code for companies that sell nothing to no one. But then you do something impossible, like yesterday, when you found me crying in the kitchen over my father's voicemail, and instead of trying to fix me, you just said, \"He sounds like you when you laugh.\" How did you know that was the exact thing I needed? How do you always know?\n\nI've started believing in time travel because of you. Not the science fiction kind\u2014the real kind, where every moment with you contains every other moment. When you sleep, I see you at eighty, mouth slightly open, still stealing all the blankets. When you're angry about injustice, I see you at seven, same furious compassion, probably defending bugs from boys with sticks. All your ages exist simultaneously in your face. I'm in love with every one of them.\n\nThe truth is I've been writing this letter my whole life. Every book I read was research. Every song I memorized was practice. Every person I failed to love was teaching me the specific gravity of real devotion. I thought I was wandering, but I was walking to you. Even my mistakes were just clumsy choreography, teaching me the exact shape of the hole you would fill.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than rejection: acceptance. Because if you say yes, if you actually marry me, then I have to become someone worthy of that yes every single day. I have to wake up and earn you again at breakfast. I have to deserve you at 3 PM on a Tuesday when nothing happens. I have to be enough during tax season and stomach flus and the specific Tuesday in March when everything feels pointless.\n\nAnd I will. God, Leyi, I will throw my whole life at the project of deserving you. Not because you demand it\u2014you love me already, inexplicably, with my coffee breath and my father's temper and my inability to finish anything except crosswords. But because the alternative\u2014a life where you exist but not with me\u2014isn't a life at all. It's just time passing.\n\nSo here's my proposition, stripped of metaphor: I want to fail and succeed inside the container of us. I want to burn dinner together. I want our fights to have sequels. I want to develop inside jokes so dense and self-referential that we become incomprehensible to others. I want to merge our libraries and argue about shelf organization. I want to catch you eating peanut butter from the jar at midnight and pretend to be scandalized every time. I want the privilege of being the person you permit to see you without your face on, without your armor, in the holy ordinary of morning light where you are most yourself and most mine.\n\nI'm not promising you happiness\u2014that's your job, you're already good at it. I'm promising you witness. I'm promising that when you change\u2014and you will, we both will, into people we can't imagine\u2014I will love each iteration with the same ferocity I love this one. I will love you like a verb, active and continuous. I will love you like time-lapse photography, seeing the whole arc even in the smallest movements.\n\nMarry me because I have already started. Because my cells have already reorganized around the fact of you. Because when scientists eventually map my genome, they'll find your name written in the junk DNA they thought was just noise. Because the alternative\u2014keeping this rings in my sock drawer for one more day\u2014might actually kill me, and I mean that in the most medical, least poetic way possible.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have something better: your grandmother's thimble you thought you lost. I found it behind the radiator and had it made into a ring because I know you believe in recycling luck. It's imperfect\u2014slightly dented, worn smooth by her fingers then yours. Like us. Like the life I'm proposing.\n\nLeyi, you impossible, necessary thing: Will you marry me? Not because I deserve you, but because love isn't about deserving? Because the universe made you from the same carbon that makes diamonds and pencil lead, and somehow you chose to be the thing that writes rather than the thing that cuts? Because saying yes would be the most unreasonable, unearned, unsustainable decision you could make, and therefore the only one that makes sense?\n\nI am not a finished person. I am a collection of attempts. But every attempt, from now until my last breath, is yours if you want it.\n\nWaiting, shaking, certain\u2014\nWarren\n\nP.S. I wrote this in one sitting.

Not from fear\u2014from the weight of truth pressing against my ribs, demanding to be born. It's 4:13 AM. I've deleted this seventeen times. Each draft felt like a translation of something untranslatable, like trying to describe the color blue to someone who's never opened their eyes.\n\nHere's what I know: Before you, I was fluent in loneliness. I had memorized all its conjugations\u2014the future tense of empty Sundays, the subjunctive mood of maybe someday, the past perfect of had loved and lost. Then you walked into that bookstore, holding Neruda upside down, pretending to read it seriously, and my entire grammar collapsed. You taught me a new language where \"home\" means the spot between your shoulder blades where my face fits perfectly when the world is too much.\n\nYou think you're ordinary. You apologize for crying at commercials, for saving dead flowers, for naming the spider in our bathroom Gerald. But Leyi\u2014you don't see what I see. How you turn waiting rooms into sanctuaries by humming. How you leave notes in library books for strangers to find. How you've trained your sadness to water other people's gardens.\n\nI've been cataloging evidence of your magic: The way you eat fruit like you're commissioning it to become part of you. Your 2 AM voice, gravelly with sleep, asking if I think fish get thirsty. The specific gravity of your sigh when you finish a good book\u2014not sad, not happy, but something unnamed that I've started calling \"Leyi'd.\" You've become a verb in my private dictionary.\n\nRemember that fight about the broken coffee maker? You threw a sock at me\u2014just one sock\u2014and stormed out. Twenty minutes later you came back with bandaids because you \"didn't want to be mad at me with a paper cut.\" That's when I understood: love isn't the absence of anger. It's continuing to care for someone's small wounds even when you want to strangle them. It's choosing their-well being over your righteousness. It's the sock you throw being dirty because the clean ones are too good to waste on conflict.\n\nThe truth is terrifying: I've started seeing time in relation to you. Not \"December\" but \"six months since you taught me to fold fitted sheets.\" Not \"Thursday\" but \"three days until I see you scrunch your nose at wine you'll pretend to like.\" My temporal lobe has reorganized itself around your existence. Scientists would call this codependency. I call it evolution.\n\nBut here's what scares me most\u2014I'm happy. Suspiciously, dangerously happy. The kind that makes me check for exits, waiting for the catch. Because people like me, we don't get people like you. We get almosts and if-onlys. We get songs that sound like your name but aren't. Yet here you are, existing, in my Tuesday life, making ordinary air feel choreographed.\n\nSo this is my proposition, my thesis statement, my trembling hypothesis: Marry me. Not because I'll make you happy\u2014you already do that yourself, beautifully, with or without me. Marry me because I want to be the person who witnesses your becoming. Who holds your hair back from futures I can't imagine. Who learns the names you'll give to houseplants we haven't killed yet.\n\nMarry me because I promise to love you at 2 PM on a Wednesday when you're ordinary. Because I'll remember your mother's birthday when you forget. Because forty years from now, when we're different people than we are tonight, I'll still choose the stranger you've become over the memory of anyone else.\n\nI'm not offering you the moon\u2014you'd have no place to put it. I'm offering you my mornings, my muscle memory, my most boring parts. I'm offering to merge our loneliness into something unrecognizable. To become so intertwined that archaeologists will argue about where you end and I begin.\n\nThe ring is in my sock drawer, wrapped in the receipt from our first dinner when you ordered three desserts and no main course. It's been there for sixty-seven days. I count them like a rosary, each day a bead of wanting to ask but waiting for the perfect words.\n\nThese aren't them. Perfect words don't exist for this. But imperfect words, trembling words, words that trip over themselves rushing toward you\u2014maybe those are the only ones worth saying.\n\nLeyi, my love, my ghost-whisperer, my collector of broken beautiful things: Will you marry me? Not because this letter moves you, but because you've already moved me\u2014relocated me entirely\u2014into a country where your yes is the only citizenship I want.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. I am so utterly, ridiculously, molecularly yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Gerald says yes too. I asked him this morning.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nKey features: Alternative approach to combined_score, Alternative approach to phenomenological_authenticity\n\n## Inspiration Programs\n\nThese programs represent diverse approaches and creative solutions that may inspire new ideas:\n\n### Inspiration 1 (Score: 0.7320, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:13 AM. I've written and deleted this seventeen times. Not because I don't know what to say, but because I know exactly what to say and it terrifies me.\n\nThe truth: I was complete before you. That's what makes this so frightening. I had built a quiet, functional life. I knew how to be alone. I was good at it. Then you happened, and now I can't remember why I thought that was enough.\n\nYou should know who you're considering marrying. I'm the man who still checks if the door is locked three times. Who rehearses ordering coffee. Who once spent an entire party hiding in the bathroom reading Wikipedia articles about deep-sea fish. I am not easy to love. I know this because I've tried to love myself and mostly failed.\n\nBut you\u2014you see my anxieties and don't try to fix them. You just sit next to them, like they're difficult relatives at dinner. When my brain spirals, you don't say \"calm down.\" You say \"tell me about it\" and somehow, in the telling, the spiral straightens.\n\nHere's what haunts me: In another timeline, we never meet. You take a different train. I choose a different bookstore. The universe shifts by seconds and we pass each other, complete strangers. This almost-nothing of us, this near-miss, wakes me up gasping. Because now that I know the specific weight of your head on my chest, the alternative\u2014the absence of that weight\u2014feels like missing an organ I didn't know I had.\n\nYou're reading this looking for poetry, for grand declarations. But I'm not a poet, Leyi. I'm just a man who noticed that you eat sandwiches from the inside out. Who knows you keep bobby pins in every jacket pocket. Who has memorized the way you mispronounce \"particularly\" when you're excited\u2014\"par-tic-a-larly\"\u2014and will never correct you because that small mistake is now part of my religion.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything profound. You made me toast. Butter all the way to the edges, the way my mother used to. You couldn't have known that. But somehow you did. That's when I understood: love isn't about the words we say. It's about the toast we make. It's about knowing when to be quiet. It's about butter reaching the edges.\n\nI need you to understand: I don't want to marry you because you complete me. I want to marry you because you make me want to be complete. There's a difference. The first is dependency. The second is evolution. You make me want to evolve, Leyi. Not into someone else, but into the person I was supposed to be before I got scared and settled for less.\n\nThat Tuesday when you cried about the extinct butterflies\u2014you said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak. Not because you were wrong, but because you were right. Everything ends. This letter will end. We will end. But that's exactly why this matters. Because in the face of that absolute certainty, we get to choose what we do with the time between now and then.\n\nI choose you. Not the idea of you, not the future with you, but you\u2014this specific human who saves fortunes from fortune cookies in books, who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, who can't sleep if the closet door is open even a crack. I choose your mundane Wednesday self, your inconvenient sadnesses, your embarrassing enthusiasms.\n\nThe ring has been in my sock drawer for sixty-seven days. Some nights I take it out and practice this moment. But this isn't practice anymore. This is the real attempt, the shaking hands, the imperfect words. This is me, Warren, the anxious man who loves you with a specificity that borders on madness, asking you, Leyi, the woman who changed my understanding of time itself, to marry me.\n\nNot because this letter moves you\u2014words are just words. But because you've already moved me. Physically. Molecularly. Into a different person who believes, for the first time, that he deserves to be loved by someone who eats sandwiches from the inside out.\n\nI am terrified. I am certain. These are not contradictions.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already changed the atomic structure of my existence. The rest is just paperwork.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I love you. I should have led with that. I love you in a way that makes me forget I'm supposed to be afraid of everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6870, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands are shaking.

Each word costs me something\u2014a held breath, a skipped heartbeat, a small death. It's 3:19 AM. The walls of this room know your name better than they know mine.\n\nListen: I was born twice. Once, screaming into fluorescent hospital light\u2014a date they put on forms. The second time was quieter: the moment you looked at me over that broken umbrella in the rain and said, \"Well, we're already wet.\" That's when I actually began.\n\nBefore you, I was a competent ghost. I paid bills. I showed up to places. I laughed at appropriate intervals. I had mastered the performance of being alive without the inconvenience of actually living. Then you\u2014you with your collection of fortune cookie fortunes, you who talks to plants like they're co-conspirators, you who cries at the happiness of strangers\u2014you made being alive mandatory.\n\nThe truth? I'm terrified of how much I need you. Not want\u2014need. The way lungs need air but don't thank it. The way roots need soil but can't survive without destroying it a little. Sometimes I wake at 4 AM just to confirm you're still breathing, and each exhale rewrites the universe into one where I'm allowed this impossible gift.\n\nYou don't know this: I've been documenting us. Not in photos\u2014in muscle memory. The weight of your Tuesday sadness. The specific frequency of your laugh when you're trying not to wake the neighbors. The way you hold oranges like they're small planets you're responsible for. I'm building an archive of you in my cells because I'm terrified that heaven is just a place where I remember you perfectly.\n\nThat night you had food poisoning\u2014you were green, genuinely green, sweat-soaked and shaking. You threw up on my shoes. Then you looked at me, mascara streaming, and said, \"I'm sorry I'm not prettier right now.\" That's when I knew I would die for you. Not romantically, not metaphorically\u2014literally trade my functioning organs for your damaged ones. Because you apologized for being human while I was falling in love with your humanity.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started praying to a God I don't believe in, just in case He's keeping score. I whisper bargains to the ceiling\u2014take my good days, my luck, my remaining years, but let her stay. Let her stay laughing at her own jokes. Let her stay mispronouncing \"specifically\" when she's excited. Let her stay leaving her coffee cups everywhere like breadcrumbs back to herself.\n\nYou want truth? I am a ruined man. You have demolished me and rebuilt me into someone I don't recognize\u2014someone who saves wishbones, who notices moon phases, who can't listen to songs in minor keys without crying. You've made me unbearably soft in a world that requires armor. You've made me hopeful, which is the cruelest thing you could have done.\n\nBut here's the worst part: I'm grateful. Grateful to be ruined by you rather than preserved by anyone else. Grateful to be this specific kind of destroyed. The kind where my DNA has forgotten how to replicate without considering you. Where my neurons fire in the shape of your silhouette. Where my bones are just calcium love letters waiting to be read by time.\n\nI'm not asking you to marry me because I can offer you happiness\u2014happiness is too small a word for what we do to each other. We perform emotional alchemy. We turn Tuesday into a proper noun. We make existing feel like a choice instead of an accident.\n\nMarry me because I want to be buried next to you, our atoms finally admitting what they've known all along\u2014that they were always the same star, just temporarily separated to learn what missing means.\n\nMarry me because when they ask me about God, I want to say \"I married Her.\"\n\nThis letter is not beautiful. It's not poetry. It's just the sound of one person completely surrendering to the unbearable fact of another person. It's my white flag, my black box recording, my last will and testament. Every word is a small death, and I'm dying willingly, gratefully, into the country of you.\n\nI love you like a broken bone loves healing wrong\u2014painfully, permanently, creating a new architecture from the damage.\n\nSay yes. Not because I deserve it, but because deserving has nothing to do with this kind of love. Say yes because we've already been married in every lifetime but this one, and I'm tired of being the only one who remembers.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. This isn't truthful. Truth would require me to tear open my chest and hand you my actual heart, still beating, still stupid with hope, still spelling your name in morse code. This is just what truth looks like when it's pretending to be words.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and current program, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6970.

My hands won't stop shaking. Not from caffeine or fear\u2014from the violence of containing this much truth in a body built for smaller feelings.\n\nHere it is, undecorated: I am thirty-one years old and I have just discovered I've been pronouncing \"love\" wrong my entire life. Every time before you was just me clearing my throat. You are the first clean note.\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I spent three hours watching videos of strangers' wedding proposals. Not for ideas\u2014for evidence that other people feel this too, this cellular reorganization, this complete betrayal of who I used to be. The comments sections were full of words like \"soulmate\" and \"destiny.\" But those words are for people who haven't watched you eat cereal in my old t-shirt at 11 PM, crying about a documentary on seahorses. Destiny doesn't know about the way you smell like vanilla and anxiety. Soulmates don't account for how you practice arguments in the shower that you'll never have.\n\nThe truth about love\u2014the truth they don't tell you\u2014is that it's mostly about Thursday afternoons. It's about the 4,000 unremarkable hours between memorable moments. It's me knowing you'll read the ending of a book first when you're stressed. It's you pretending not to notice when I eat your leftovers. It's the way we've wordlessly agreed that the left side of the couch is mine and the right is yours, but the middle is ours. That's where love lives\u2014in the DMZ between two separate humans who've agreed to blur.\n\nI was somebody before you. I had opinions about wine. I remembered to eat breakfast. I could watch the news without wondering what you'd say about it. That person is dead now, Leyi. You killed him the day you absentmindedly held my hand during that terrible movie, not romantic, just reaching for something familiar in the dark. His last thought was \"oh, this is it. This is the trap. I'm done for.\" And he was right.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I am a man who googles \"how to know if cats are happy.\" Who practices speeches I'll never give. Who saves your voicemails in case technology fails and I need evidence you existed. I am clinically anxious, recreationally pessimistic, and I've been carrying this ring for ninety-three days like a tumor I'm too scared to remove. Some nights I hold it up to the light and think about probability\u2014how many wrong turns led to the right one, to you, to this impossible now where you exist and somehow tolerate me existing beside you.\n\nRemember that morning you found me on the bathroom floor, panicking about nothing and everything? You didn't try to fix me. You just sat down on the cold tile and said, \"Okay, we're doing this here today.\" Then you started listing every bird you could name, alphabetically, until my breathing synced with your rhythm. Albatross. Blue jay. Cardinal. That's when I knew: love isn't about finding someone who completes you. It's about finding someone who makes being incomplete bearable.\n\nBut here's the thing that keeps me up at 4:47 AM: You're going to die. I'm going to die. These bodies are just rental units and the lease is non-negotiable. One day, one of us will be in a room without the other, holding nothing but neural patterns and ghost weight. This thought should terrify me. Instead, it clarifies everything. If we're both just temporary collections of atoms pretending to be people, then the fact that your atoms chose to orbit mine feels like the only miracle I need to believe in.\n\nSo here's my offer, stripped of romance: I want to synchronize our decay. I want to argue about thermostats and discover new ways to disappoint each other. I want to develop specific types of silence\u2014the comfortable kind, the furious kind, the kind that means we're both thinking about the same dead friend. I want to become so entangled that future archaeologists will have to invent a new word for what we were to each other.\n\nMarry me. Not because you love me\u2014love is just a chemical imperative dressed up in poetry. Marry me because when you laugh at your own jokes, my pancreas does something unscientific. Because you've ruined every song, every street corner, every mundane Tuesday with your presence or absence. Because I want to be buried next to you, our bones finally honest about what they've been trying to say all along.\n\nThis isn't a love letter. Love letters are for people who think words can carry feeling. This is just evidence of a complete surrender. This is me saying: you won. Whatever game we were playing, whatever defenses I had, whatever person I planned to be\u2014you won. Now I'm just this anxious man at 4:47 AM, hoping the woman who owns his future tense will say yes to staying in it.\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother. She married a man who couldn't read but memorized entire books so he could tell them to her. That's what I'm offering\u2014not literacy, but the willingness to memorize you, page by page, until I can recite you in the dark.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know that either way, you've already relocated me. I'm no longer where I started. I live now in the country of loving you, and there's no valid passport back.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. Yesterday you asked if I thought we were meant to be. The answer is no. \"Meant to be\" implies intention, design, purpose. We're not meant to be\u2014we're what happened when two accidents collided and decided to call the wreckage home.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
