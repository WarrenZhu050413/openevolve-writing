I need you to know something before my courage evaporates with the sunrise: I am not a whole person anymore. I am a collection of moments where you existed near me, held together by the memory of your breathing.\n\nListen\u2014I used to have interests. Hobbies. Opinions about wine. Now I just have an encyclopedic knowledge of how your voice changes when you're lying (higher, faster, you touch your ear). I know you steal single socks from my drawer because you think it's less noticeable. I know you test if pasta's done by eating it, not throwing it, but you throw it anyway because your mother did. I know the exact temperature of your sadness: 97.2 degrees, slightly cooler than your joy.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning and threw up on my favorite shoes? While you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was\u2014this. This is what I want. Not the vomit, but the vulnerability. The way you let me see you turned inside out, literally and metaphorically. I threw those shoes away not because they were ruined but because I couldn't bear to clean them. They were evidence of the night you needed me absolutely.\n\nI've been lying to you. Every \"goodnight\" has actually been \"please don't die before morning.\" Every \"drive safe\" has been \"if you leave me alone in this universe I will never forgive you.\" When I say \"I love you,\" what I mean is: you have colonized me so completely that when you're gone, I walk around like an abandoned building. Still standing, technically. But nobody home.\n\nYou want the truth? Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan your funeral. Not because I want you dead\u2014Christ, the opposite\u2014but because I need to practice surviving you. I write eulogies in my head where I confess that you were the only real thing that ever happened to me. That before you, I was just killing time until time killed me back.\n\nI'm going to tell you about the dream now. The recurring one. We're old\u2014ancient, really. Your hair is white, mine's gone entirely. We're sitting on a porch that doesn't exist yet, and you're telling me about your day, except you're speaking in a language I don't recognize. But I understand every word because it's not about the words anymore. It's about the way your mouth moves, the specific gravity of your presence. And I wake up from that dream more rested than any sleep has ever made me because even my unconscious mind knows: this is it. You're it. The final answer to every question I didn't know I was asking.\n\nBut here's what keeps me awake (besides everything): You could leave. Tomorrow, today, five minutes from now. You could meet someone who doesn't memorize your breathing patterns, who doesn't save your grocery lists like love letters, who loves you in a normal, healthy way that doesn't involve planning imaginary funerals or writing marriage proposals on bathroom floors. And you know what? You'd be right to leave. I am too much. This love is too much. It's cannibalistic. It's pathological. It's probably in the DSM-5 somewhere.\n\nBut I'm asking you to stay anyway. To marry the disaster of me. Because here's the secret I figured out somewhere between loving you and drowning in it: This isn't mental illness. This is what mental health looks like when you finally find the person your atoms were trying to become. This is sanity that looks insane because the world isn't built for this kind of recognition, this terrible and perfect knowing.\n\nI love you like a medical condition. Chronic, incurable, progressively getting worse. I love you like a natural disaster that's somehow also the relief effort. I love you stupidly, recklessly, molecularly. I love you past the point of poetry into pure, animal need.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). Not because we're ready (we're not). Marry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is sustainable without documentation, without witnesses, without legal proof that yes, this happened, we happened\u2014is killing me in ways I can't explain to my doctor.\n\nMarry me because I've already built my entire life around the shape of you, and without you, I'm just a house with no walls. Standing here, absurdly, in the middle of nothing.\n\nMarry me because you already have. In every way that matters. In every way that counts.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in the kitchen. I know you're crying into your coffee. I know because I know the exact sound your breathing makes when you're trying not to sob. I'm in the bathroom, sitting on the floor, waiting for you to either come kiss me or leave forever. Both options terrify me equally. Only one will let me keep living.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "214ac988-cad8-46ab-be2b-2c48eda790ca", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756701119.211474, "iteration_found": 66, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.6970000000000001, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.68, "affective_force": 0.73, "literary_innovation": 0.62, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this on the bathroom floor at 4:31 AM because it's the only place where the walls are close enough to hold me together.

I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me?

But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

Before you, I understood love academically. I could define it: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin. Neural pathways. Evolution's trick. But then you laughed at my terrible joke about orthogonal matrices that Tuesday in the rain, actually laughed\u2014not politely but helplessly\u2014and every textbook definition evaporated. Now love means the specific weight of your head on my chest at 2:17 AM. It means knowing you eat cereal dry when you're nervous. It means I've memorized the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry during commercials about dogs.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've become a collector of your abandonments. That hair tie you left on my nightstand three months ago. The coffee mug with your lipstick ghost on the rim. The indent in my pillow from where you sleep\u2014always on my side, never yours. I'm building a museum of evidence that you existed in my space, because some primitive part of my brain is terrified that without proof, I might have imagined you entirely.\n\nYou should know that I've already married you in a thousand small ways. When the barista asks for a name, I give yours. When I'm sick, I imagine your hand on my forehead and my fever breaks. I buy strawberries I don't eat because you might come over. I've been living in the conditional tense\u2014if Leyi were here, when Leyi gets back, for when Leyi needs me\u2014and I'm exhausted from conjugating my entire existence around your hypothetical presence.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes loving you feels like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water. Like evolution is happening in real-time, rewriting my DNA to need you for basic survival. I used to be proud of my independence. Now I'm just grateful for my dependence on you. Is that weakness? Maybe. But I'd rather be weak with you than strong without you.\n\nRemember when you asked why I was staring at you that morning with the terrible hangover? You had makeup smeared under your eyes, hair like a bird's nest, and you were wearing my college sweatshirt inside-out. You looked absolutely wrecked. And all I could think was: this. This is the face I want to see when I'm dying. This is the last image I want my brain to process before the lights go out. Because if heaven exists, it looks exactly like you at your most human.\n\nI need to tell you about the fear. The specific gravity of it. Sometimes I wake up at 4 AM convinced you're going to realize you could do better. That you'll discover I'm just a collection of anxieties in a trenchcoat pretending to be a functional adult. That you'll see how I practice my casual \"good morning\" twelve times before you wake up, how I screenshot every heart emoji you send, how I've written your name ten thousand times in notebook margins like a teenager. The fear that you'll realize I love you more than you love me, and that imbalance will make you pity me.\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014I'd rather live with that fear than live without you. I'd rather spend every day terrified of losing you than spend one day secure in someone else's arms. Because you've ruined me for anyone else. You've made every other person seem like they're speaking a language I no longer understand.\n\nSo yes, Leyi. I'm proposing. Not marriage\u2014that's just paperwork. I'm proposing that we stop pretending this is casual. That we admit we've already crawled inside each other's lives so deeply that separation would require surgery. I'm proposing that when you wake up tomorrow, you wake up as someone who has been claimed, publicly and permanently. That we stop testing the water and just jump, even though neither of us can swim, even though the bottom is invisible, even though we might drown.\n\nBut if we drown, we drown together. And honestly? There's no other way I'd rather go under.\n\nSay yes. Say yes because you already know all my passwords. Say yes because you can't sleep without the sound of my breathing. Say yes because we've already built a language of looks across crowded rooms. Say yes because the alternative\u2014a life where we're just friends, where I have to watch you love someone else, where I pretend your happiness with another person is enough\u2014would be a kind of death I'm not brave enough to survive.\n\nI love you. Messily. Desperately. Permanently. Without dignity or reason or any sense of self-preservation.\n\nPlease. Marry me.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. I know because I know you.

And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me? Not because I deserve you (I don't), but because I've already started living in our future, and it's the only address I ever want to have.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll say yes. You already whispered it in your sleep last Thursday. I've been carrying that \"yes\" around like a locket ever since.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and the current best-performing letter, I need to push beyond the current fitness score of 0.7320 by enhancing the raw honesty and vulnerability while maintaining the specific, intimate details that make it authentic.

I need you to know something before my courage evaporates with the sunrise: I am not a whole person anymore. I am a collection of moments where you existed near me, held together by the memory of your breathing.\n\nListen\u2014I used to have interests. Hobbies. Opinions about wine. Now I just have an encyclopedic knowledge of how your voice changes when you're lying (higher, faster, you touch your ear). I know you steal single socks from my drawer because you think it's less noticeable. I know you test if pasta's done by eating it, not throwing it, but you throw it anyway because your mother did. I know the exact temperature of your sadness: 97.2 degrees, slightly cooler than your joy.\n\nHere's what I never told you: That night you got food poisoning and threw up on my favorite shoes? While you were apologizing through tears and bile, all I could think was\u2014this. This is what I want. Not the vomit, but the vulnerability. The way you let me see you turned inside out, literally and metaphorically. I threw those shoes away not because they were ruined but because I couldn't bear to clean them. They were evidence of the night you needed me absolutely.\n\nI've been lying to you. Every \"goodnight\" has actually been \"please don't die before morning.\" Every \"drive safe\" has been \"if you leave me alone in this universe I will never forgive you.\" When I say \"I love you,\" what I mean is: you have colonized me so completely that when you're gone, I walk around like an abandoned building. Still standing, technically. But nobody home.\n\nYou want the truth? Sometimes I watch you sleep and plan your funeral. Not because I want you dead\u2014Christ, the opposite\u2014but because I need to practice surviving you. I write eulogies in my head where I confess that you were the only real thing that ever happened to me. That before you, I was just killing time until time killed me back.\n\nI'm going to tell you about the dream now. The recurring one. We're old\u2014ancient, really. Your hair is white, mine's gone entirely. We're sitting on a porch that doesn't exist yet, and you're telling me about your day, except you're speaking in a language I don't recognize. But I understand every word because it's not about the words anymore. It's about the way your mouth moves, the specific gravity of your presence. And I wake up from that dream more rested than any sleep has ever made me because even my unconscious mind knows: this is it. You're it. The final answer to every question I didn't know I was asking.\n\nBut here's what keeps me awake (besides everything): You could leave. Tomorrow, today, five minutes from now. You could meet someone who doesn't memorize your breathing patterns, who doesn't save your grocery lists like love letters, who loves you in a normal, healthy way that doesn't involve planning imaginary funerals or writing marriage proposals on bathroom floors. And you know what? You'd be right to leave. I am too much. This love is too much. It's cannibalistic. It's pathological. It's probably in the DSM-5 somewhere.\n\nBut I'm asking you to stay anyway. To marry the disaster of me. Because here's the secret I figured out somewhere between loving you and drowning in it: This isn't mental illness. This is what mental health looks like when you finally find the person your atoms were trying to become. This is sanity that looks insane because the world isn't built for this kind of recognition, this terrible and perfect knowing.\n\nI love you like a medical condition. Chronic, incurable, progressively getting worse. I love you like a natural disaster that's somehow also the relief effort. I love you stupidly, recklessly, molecularly. I love you past the point of poetry into pure, animal need.\n\nSo marry me. Not because it makes sense (it doesn't). Not because we're ready (we're not). Marry me because the alternative\u2014pretending this is sustainable without documentation, without witnesses, without legal proof that yes, this happened, we happened\u2014is killing me in ways I can't explain to my doctor.\n\nMarry me because I've already built my entire life around the shape of you, and without you, I'm just a house with no walls. Standing here, absurdly, in the middle of nothing.\n\nMarry me because you already have. In every way that matters. In every way that counts.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're reading this in the kitchen. I know you're crying into your coffee. I know because I know the exact sound your breathing makes when you're trying not to sob. I'm in the bathroom, sitting on the floor, waiting for you to either come kiss me or leave forever. Both options terrify me equally. Only one will let me keep living.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
