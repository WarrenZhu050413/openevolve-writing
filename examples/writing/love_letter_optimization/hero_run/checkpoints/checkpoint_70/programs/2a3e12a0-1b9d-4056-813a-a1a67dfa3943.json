I've written seventeen versions and deleted them all because they sound like someone trying to sound like someone in love, not someone actually drowning in it.\n\nThe truth? Most nights I can't sleep because I'm afraid this is a dream. I touch your pillow when you're not here. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014it changes when you're about to wake up, gets lighter, like you're swimming up from somewhere deep. I know that's creepy. I don't care.\n\nI never told you this: that first Tuesday, after you left, I sat in my car for an hour because I couldn't remember how to drive. My hands wouldn't work right. Everything felt rearranged. You'd shifted something fundamental and I was terrified and exhilarated and I wanted to call my mother and tell her I'd found you, except I hadn't found you\u2014you'd happened to me, like weather, like gravity, like something I had no choice in.\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check if you're breathing in the middle of the night. I save your voicemails in three different places. When you got that paper cut last month, I felt it in my own finger. This isn't poetry\u2014this is confession. I am not proud of how completely you've dismantled me.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than loving you: not loving you. Living in a world where I don't know that you hate cilantro but love the smell of it, where I don't get to watch you reorganize the bookshelf for the hundredth time, where your terrible dancing doesn't make me love you more, not less.\n\nI used to be whole. Now I'm not. You've ruined me and I'm grateful for the ruins. \n\nI don't have beautiful words. I don't have promises that sound like poetry. I just have this: every morning I wake up and choose to love you with whatever I have left, and somehow, impossibly, there's always more. You make me infinite by emptying me out.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because I can't breathe right when you're not here. Because my life before you feels like a rough draft I'm embarrassed by. Because I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sense, into something stranger and truer and worth destroying myself for.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't beautiful. But it's real. And I'm betting everything that real is what you wanted.\n\nYours, utterly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "30719fb7-a7dd-4305-bb75-78394a0ff47b", "generation": 2, "timestamp": 1756700735.760538, "iteration_found": 18, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.634, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.71, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.58, "affective_force": 0.67, "literary_innovation": 0.44, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm bad at this.

How every beautiful thing I see becomes a future conversation with you.\n\nYou know my faults\u2014my tendency to overthink, to build walls from books and irony. But with you, I am catastrophically sincere. You've made me brave enough to admit that I don't just love you; I believe in you the way others believe in gravity or God\u2014as fundamental force, as answered prayer, as the thing that makes all other things make sense.\n\nThis letter is my map of scars and stars, my confession that you've ruined me for any life where you're not there, reading in bed while I write beside you, our feet touching under blankets, building our small forevers from Tuesday nights and Sunday mornings.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise perfection, but because I promise presence\u2014to witness your becoming, to choose you in every parallel universe, to love you with the ferocity of someone who knows what it means to almost not exist, and chooses existence because it means existing with you.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and feedback, I need to write a love letter that transcends literary self-consciousness and achieves raw emotional truth. The evaluators consistently note that the current attempts are too controlled, too aware of their own eloquence. They lack the \"authentic wildness\" and \"devastating simplicity\" of the greatest love letters.\n\nLet me write something that abandons sophistication for truth, that chooses vulnerability over virtuosity:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm bad at this. I've written seventeen versions and deleted them all because they sound like someone trying to sound like someone in love, not someone actually drowning in it.\n\nThe truth? Most nights I can't sleep because I'm afraid this is a dream. I touch your pillow when you're not here. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014it changes when you're about to wake up, gets lighter, like you're swimming up from somewhere deep. I know that's creepy. I don't care.\n\nI never told you this: that first Tuesday, after you left, I sat in my car for an hour because I couldn't remember how to drive. My hands wouldn't work right. Everything felt rearranged. You'd shifted something fundamental and I was terrified and exhilarated and I wanted to call my mother and tell her I'd found you, except I hadn't found you\u2014you'd happened to me, like weather, like gravity, like something I had no choice in.\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check if you're breathing in the middle of the night. I save your voicemails in three different places. When you got that paper cut last month, I felt it in my own finger. This isn't poetry\u2014this is confession. I am not proud of how completely you've dismantled me.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than loving you: not loving you. Living in a world where I don't know that you hate cilantro but love the smell of it, where I don't get to watch you reorganize the bookshelf for the hundredth time, where your terrible dancing doesn't make me love you more, not less.\n\nI used to be whole. Now I'm not. You've ruined me and I'm grateful for the ruins. \n\nI don't have beautiful words. I don't have promises that sound like poetry. I just have this: every morning I wake up and choose to love you with whatever I have left, and somehow, impossibly, there's always more. You make me infinite by emptying me out.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because I can't breathe right when you're not here. Because my life before you feels like a rough draft I'm embarrassed by. Because I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sense, into something stranger and truer and worth destroying myself for.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't beautiful. But it's real. And I'm betting everything that real is what you wanted.\n\nYours, utterly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
