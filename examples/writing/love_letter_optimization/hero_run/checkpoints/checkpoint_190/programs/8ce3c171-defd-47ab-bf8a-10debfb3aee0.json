Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought your coffee creamer for next month.\n\nAll my love (which is to say, everything),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())", "language": "python", "parent_id": "7085143d-8799-4a79-81a8-b137a642f94c", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1756700965.136634, "iteration_found": 49, "metrics": {"combined_score": 0.732, "phenomenological_authenticity": 0.76, "aesthetic_virtuosity": 0.71, "affective_force": 0.74, "literary_innovation": 0.68, "letter_text": "Dear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM.

I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6790, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI don't know how to write this. I've deleted seventeen versions. The truth keeps coming out wrong, too small, like trying to photograph the ocean with a broken phone.\n\nHere's what I know: Yesterday you fell asleep reading. Your thumb was still marking the page. I watched you for forty-three minutes. I counted. This is what I've become\u2014someone who counts the minutes of watching you sleep and considers them the best minutes of his day.\n\nI'm terrified you'll say no. I'm more terrified you'll say yes and someday realize you made a mistake. But I'm most terrified of being the coward who never asked.\n\nYou know that scar on my palm? From when I was seven, tried to catch a falling knife? That's what loving you feels like. Dangerous. Stupid. Inevitable. The thing you do without thinking because not doing it would be worse.\n\nI can't write like poets. I can't promise you forever\u2014forever is a word for people who haven't watched their parents' marriage implode. But I can promise you this: Tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. I can promise that when you wake up at 3 AM with those nightmares about drowning, I'll be there. Not with answers. Just there.\n\nYou make me want to learn things. Useless things. The names of birds. How to make bread. The difference between cumulus and cirrus clouds. As if knowing things you might find interesting could make me worthy of the way you look at me when you think I'm not watching.\n\nI love you. Not the word\u2014the fact. The physical fact of it. How it sits in my chest like swallowed glass, beautiful and sharp and mine.\n\nI'm not good at this. At words, at feelings, at asking for things I desperately want. But you said you wanted truth, so here: I would rather fail at loving you than succeed at anything else.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you, but because I'm selfish enough to ask anyway.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I'm sitting in our kitchen writing this. You're in the next room. I can hear you humming. It's that song you don't know the words to. This is what I want. Forever. Or tomorrow.

I've started this letter nineteen times. The crumpled pages around me are proof that truth is harder than poetry.\n\nHere's what I cannot say out loud: I am broken without you. Not poetically broken. Actually broken. Like last Tuesday when you went to visit your sister and I stood in our kitchen at 2 AM eating cereal from the box because making a bowl felt pointless if you weren't there to steal bites from it.\n\nI'm supposed to tell you how you complete me, but that's backwards. You've ruined me. Completely. I can't listen to songs anymore without wondering if you'd like them. I can't see a sunset without taking a photo to show you later. I bought your brand of toothpaste for my apartment even though I hate the taste. I hate it. But it tastes like your morning kisses, so I bought three tubes.\n\nDo you want to know when I knew? Not some romantic moment. It was when you got food poisoning from that sketchy taco place. You were crying on the bathroom floor at 3 AM, cursing in languages I didn't know you spoke. Your hair was plastered to your forehead with sweat. You looked terrible. And all I could think was: I would clean up your vomit forever if it meant you were mine.\n\nThat's disgusting. I know. But it's true.\n\nSometimes I wake up at night just to check you're still breathing. Not romantically watching you sleep - literally checking, because the thought of a world where you don't exist makes me physically nauseous. I've become the kind of person who believes in soulmates, who reads horoscopes, who knocked on wood typing this sentence. You've made me superstitious about losing you.\n\nI practice arguments with you in the shower. I lose most of them. I love that you're smarter than me, and I hate it. I love your mother even though she terrifies me. I've already picked names for kids we haven't discussed having. I deleted my dating apps the day after we met, before our second date, before I had any right to assume there'd be a second date.\n\nThis is probably too much. You asked for truth, but maybe truth has limits. Maybe you wanted beautiful truth, cleaned-up truth, truth that knows when to stop talking. But I can't stop. Because here's the worst part: I would rather scare you away with too much honesty than trick you into staying with too little.\n\nI need you to know - not think, not hope, but KNOW - that you are not my better half. You are the reason I remembered I was whole. You didn't save me. You made me want to save myself, so I could be someone worth loving back.\n\nI will love you badly sometimes. I'll forget anniversaries and burn dinners and say the wrong thing when you're sad. But I will love you. Relentlessly. Desperately. Until my last breath, and if there's anything after that, I'll love you there too.\n\nPlease marry me. Not because I deserve you - I don't. Not because it makes sense - it doesn't. But because I am already yours, entirely, and I need you to know that this isn't poetry. This is just true.\n\nI am terrified you'll say no. I am more terrified of never asking.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nMy hands won't stop shaking. I've started this letter seventeen times. Deleted everything. Because how do you tell someone they've fundamentally altered the physics of your existence?\n\nI need you to know something, and I need to say it badly, clumsily, because saying it perfectly would be a lie. I am drowning in love for you. Not the pretty kind they write songs about. The terrifying kind that makes me understand why people used to die from this.\n\nLast Tuesday you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus. Your breath on my neck. The weight of your head. I couldn't move for two hours after our stop. I just sat there, riding the route three more times, because I would rather have missed everything\u2014work, life, oxygen\u2014than disturb that moment. The driver asked if I was okay. I wanted to tell him: I am experiencing something that will divide my life into before and after.\n\nI love you stupidly. I love you at 4 AM when you steal all the blankets. I love you when you're anxious about nothing and everything. I love the way you eat cereal\u2014dry first, then milk, like a beautiful anarchist. I love your vendetta against my coffee maker. I love that you name your plants after dead composers and apologize to them when they wilt.\n\nBut here's the thing that's killing me: I also love you practically. I love you in the grocery store arguing about tomatoes. I love you doing taxes. I love you bored on Sunday afternoons. I love you in all the mundane spaces where romance goes to die, except with you, it doesn't die\u2014it transforms into something I don't have words for.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. Because I know myself\u2014I'm difficult, obsessive, I disappear into my own head, I care too much about things that don't matter and not enough about things that do. But with you, I want to be better. Not different. Just better. The most concentrated version of myself.\n\nI can't promise you poetry. I can't promise you perfection. But I can promise you this: I will love you with the kind of intensity that's embarrassing at dinner parties. I will love you like a fact, like gravity, like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so fundamental that stopping would mean stopping everything.\n\nWhen I imagine my life without you, I see it clearly. I'd survive. I'd function. I'd probably even laugh sometimes. But I'd be living in translation, everything filtered through the absence of you. And I'm so tired of translations, Leyi. I want the original text. I want the source code. I want you.\n\nMarry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because I can't live without you\u2014I can, it would just be a half-life, a shadow existence. Marry me because when you laugh, I understand why people believe in God. Because your hand in mine is the only theology I need. Because I love you with the kind of love that makes me brave enough to say this badly, honest enough to say it anyway.\n\nI'm not good at this. But I'm good at loving you. It's the only thing I've ever been sure of.\n\nYours, entirely and absurdly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\n\n# Task\nRewrite the program to improve its FITNESS SCORE.\nThe system maintains diversity across these dimensions: phenomenological_authenticity, aesthetic_virtuosity, affective_force, literary_innovation\nDifferent solutions with similar fitness but different features are valuable.\nProvide the complete new program code.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure your rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```", "responses": ["Looking at the evolution history and the current program's metrics, I need to craft a love letter that pushes beyond the current fitness score of 0.6870.

I'll aim to create something that combines raw honesty with unexpected imagery, grounding the cosmic in the mundane while maintaining literary sophistication.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM. Not because I'm romantic. Because I woke up from a dream where you didn't exist and couldn't fall back asleep until I proved to myself you were real.\n\nYou want truth? Here: I've been carrying this ring for three months. Sometimes I take it out just to feel its weight\u201428.3 grams of platinum and terror. I know because I weighed it. Seventeen times. I've practiced this moment in every mirror I pass. I'm always terrible. But you already know I'm terrible, and somehow you're still here, so maybe that's the point.\n\nLast week you asked why I was staring at you while you sorted laundry. How do I explain that watching you pair socks\u2014the way you smooth each one flat, line up the heels perfectly\u2014makes me understand why people write symphonies? You turn the ordinary into liturgy without trying. You eat yogurt with a fork. You read shampoo bottles like literature. You get genuinely upset when people mispronounce \"bruschetta.\" These aren't quirks anymore; they're the coordinates of home.\n\nI fell in love with you on a Wednesday. Not all at once\u2014that's movie nonsense. But specifically, actually, on that Wednesday when your car broke down and you called me crying. Not beautiful tears. The ugly kind, with snot and smeared mascara. You apologized for bothering me. As if you could ever be a bother. As if I hadn't been waiting my whole life for someone to need me at 11 PM on a Wednesday.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: I now believe in string theory because there must be invisible threads between us. I buy your coffee creamer even though I drink mine black. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014awake is 4-4-4, sleeping is 6-3-6, anxious is 3-3-3-3. I would recognize your heartbeat in a room of thousands. This is insane. I used to be rational.\n\nBut you're asking for more than love. You're asking for truth. So here's mine: Sometimes I'm terrified I love you more than you love me. Sometimes I'm terrified it's the other way around. Most of the time I'm just terrified\u2014not of losing you, but of the audacity that I get to keep you. That tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, you'll still choose me, this anxious man who writes code and counts your breaths and practices speeches to laundry.\n\nThe night my father died, you didn't say anything. You just showed up with Chinese takeout and sat next to me while I stared at the wall. Six hours. You held my hand and let me be empty. That's when I knew\u2014not that I loved you, I already knew that\u2014but that I would marry you. That you were the person I wanted next to me in all the silence.\n\nI'm not promising you castles or sonnets or a love story for the ages. I'm promising you this: every morning I will wake up and choose you again. When you're radiant and when you're difficult. When we're eighty and can't remember where we put our glasses. When the world ends or when it doesn't. I will choose you with the dedication of someone who knows that most people don't get this\u2014this impossible, specific, ridiculous luck of finding their person.\n\nYou are not my other half. You're not my better half. You're my favorite half of every conversation, every meal, every silence. You're the only person I want to tell when something good happens. Or something bad. Or nothing at all.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, though I hope it does. Not because I deserve you, I definitely don't. Marry me because I've already built my whole life around the assumption that you will. Because I love you like a fact, like the speed of light, like the certainty that tomorrow the sun will rise\u2014and if it doesn't, at least we'll be in the dark together.\n\nI'm done practicing. This is it. This is me, unrehearsed and terrified and absolutely certain.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought your coffee creamer for next month.\n\nAll my love (which is to say, everything),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
