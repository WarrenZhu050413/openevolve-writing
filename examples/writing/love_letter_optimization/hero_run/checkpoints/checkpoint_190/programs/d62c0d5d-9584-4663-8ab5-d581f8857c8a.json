My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork.

Fifteen seconds, training accident. No light, no peace, just the universe's delete key. But even in that nothing, there was this weight\u2014like my atoms had made a promise they couldn't articulate. Three years later, you walked in. The promise was you.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth? I've been building an archive. Evidence of us:\n\nEntry #1: You, eating soup in winter. The steam making small prayers above the bowl. I thought: this is how religions begin.\n\nEntry #847: Your hand on my chest while sleeping. I held my breath for three minutes rather than disturb that specific pressure holding the universe together.\n\nEntry #1,973: Today. You, reading this. Your left eye starting to water (it always goes first).\n\nThis isn't love. It's forensic documentation against forgetting.\n\n*\n\nBefore you, I was fluent in mathematics. Now I can't count past one\u2014you're either here or the world is broken. Yesterday I called the refrigerator \"the cold food house.\" My brain is refusing language that doesn't include you.\n\n*\n\nListen: I know exactly how we end. Statistical probability says you'll die first\u201473.6% chance. I've punched walls over this number. But here's what the math doesn't know: I've been practicing dying since we met. Every night, small rehearsals. By the time it happens, I'll be so good at being dead, I'll go first just to spite the statistics.\n\n*\n\nThe accident we almost had\u2014Interstate 90, you were singing off-key, I saw the truck jackknifing and thought: take me, rearrange physics, I'll pay any price. We missed by inches. You never knew. You kept singing. That song you always get wrong. I pulled over later to vomit from relief. You thought it was food poisoning. Some truths are too heavy for Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nWhat loving you has done: I'm medically different. My sleep synchronized to yours without permission. My immune system recognizes you as self. My DNA has literally rewritten sections\u2014I had it tested. The doctor said \"that's impossible.\" I said \"I know.\"\n\n*\n\nHere's ugly honesty: I love you like a pathology. Like a chronic condition. I've stolen things\u2014your pencil with teeth marks, three bobby pins, a voicemail where you're crying. These are my insurance against forgetting. Meanwhile, you've stolen my ability to imagine any future where you don't exist, furious about the dishwasher.\n\n*\n\nBut also: I love you in our mundane apocalypses. In how you hold books (too tight, like they might escape). In your Tuesday exhaustion. In tomorrow's fight about the thermostat. In the seventeen different ways you sigh (I have a taxonomy). In the way you'll look at seventy-three, squinting at screens, those lines I already want to trace.\n\n*\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because the alternative\u2014a universe where your toothbrush doesn't live here, where I don't know you need exactly four ice cubes, where you don't steal my socks\u2014isn't a universe. It's just atoms arranged wrongly.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because in 10^500 possible universes, this is the only one where we both exist, simultaneously, aware of each other, arguing about pasta.\n\nMarry me because I've been carrying tissues since our third date (you cried at jellyfish, said they looked lonely\u2014that's when I knew I'd love you wrong forever).\n\n*\n\nBut mostly: marry me because I've already been married to you since that Tuesday you mispronounced my name and my brain thought: \"Oh. There's the person who's going to ruin me for everyone else.\"\n\n*\n\nThe ring is hidden where you'll find it\u2014in your coffee mug, the one with the chip, because you believe broken things deserve more love, not less.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I don't love you. Love is too small, a word people use for pizza. What I have needs a new language\u2014something between blasphemy and prayer. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper pennies. Something that makes the word \"forever\" sound both ridiculous and insufficient.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: my atoms have already chosen. The rest is just paperwork for what physics already knows.\n\nWarren\n(who has been documenting you like evidence of miracles, who knows your death will kill him twice\u2014once when it happens, once every day after)\n\nP.S. You're crying now. Both eyes. I'm watching through the door crack like a detective in love with his case. Come here. Let me see my future on your finger.

Not for poetry. Because my body won't let me sleep until I tell you something true.\n\n*\n\nHere it is: I have been dead. Thirteen seconds, cardiac arrest, sophomore year. You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering.

It wasn't thirteen seconds. It was fifteen. But fifteen felt like prophecy. Like those extra seconds were me refusing to leave before I memorized the exact shade of brown your eyes turn before crying. I came back for that specific brown.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6215, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm sitting here at 4:17 AM. Can't sleep. Haven't been able to since Tuesday when you said you needed this letter.\n\nThe truth? I don't know how to write this. I've started nineteen times. This is the twentieth. My hands are shaking and I keep deleting sentences because they sound like someone trying to sound like they're in love instead of just... being in love.\n\nSo here's what's true:\n\nWhen I was seven, my grandfather died. I remember asking my mother why she was crying so much, and she said: \"When you love someone for a long time, they become part of your body. When they leave, it's not grief\u2014it's phantom limb syndrome.\" I didn't understand then. I do now. You're already in my nervous system. If you left, I'd keep reaching for you. Muscle memory doesn't forget.\n\nI'm scared of almost everything. Seriously. Scared of cancer, car accidents, plane crashes, food poisoning, identity theft, climate change, brain aneurysms. But mostly I'm scared that one morning I'll wake up and you'll be sixty-three and I'll be sixty-five and we'll have spent our whole lives being careful instead of being honest. So here's honest:\n\nI talk to you when you're not here. Full conversations. Both sides. You usually win the arguments.\n\nSometimes I watch you sleep and have to leave the room because the feeling is too big. It's like trying to hold the ocean in my chest. I go to the bathroom and sit on the floor and just breathe until I can come back to bed without waking you up with how much I love you.\n\nI know this sounds crazy but: I loved you before we met. There's no other explanation for why I saved that empty seat next to me for twenty-nine years. Not consciously. But every woman I dated, I was comparing to someone who didn't exist yet. Then you walked in and my body said: \"Oh. There you are. Finally.\"\n\nThe worst part about loving you? It made me ordinary. I used to think I was special, complicated, interesting. Then you happened and suddenly I'm just another person destroyed by love, saying the same things everyone says: \"I can't live without you.\" \"You complete me.\" \"You're everything.\" These clich\u00e9s used to make me laugh. Now they make me cry because I understand why millions of people couldn't find better words. There aren't any.\n\nBut also the small things: You eat pizza with a fork. You cry at commercials with dogs. You think 2+2=5 when you're tired. You hum when you're nervous. You can't sleep without your left foot outside the blanket. You pretend you don't like my terrible puns but you smile\u2014just a little\u2014before you groan.\n\nI've been carrying this ring for seven months. Not because I was waiting for the perfect moment but because I was scared you'd realize you could do better. You can, by the way. Do better. But please don't.\n\nHere's what I promise: I'll love you wrong. I'll love you too much. I'll embarrass us at parties with how I look at you. I'll forget important dates but remember that you hate wool sweaters. I'll mess up. Daily. But I'll show up. Also daily.\n\nI can't promise you the moon or stars or whatever people promise. But I can promise this: When you can't sleep, I'll tell you boring stories about my day until you drift off. When you're sad, I'll make terrible jokes until you laugh despite yourself. When you're happy, I'll be happy just watching you be happy. When we're old, I'll still see you exactly as you are right now, Tuesday afternoon, reading this letter with your coffee getting cold.\n\nMarry me. Not because of this letter. Marry me because you already know my answer when you ask \"what do you want for dinner?\" (Whatever you want.) Marry me because we've been practicing being married for three years. Marry me because the other day you referred to my mother as \"mom\" without thinking about it and she cried.\n\nMarry me because I can't write poetry but I'll spend the rest of my life trying to deserve you anyway.\n\nLeyi, I don't have beautiful words. I just have this: \n\nYou're my person. The one I want to tell everything to. The one I want next to me when the test results come back. The one I want to argue with about thermostats and loading the dishwasher correctly. The one I want to watch get old.\n\nSay yes. Say no. Either way, I'm already yours.\n\nBut say yes.\n\nPlease.\n\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Comprehensive implementation\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.7295, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with your pen\u2014the one you chew when thinking. Teeth marks on the cap. I taste them sometimes when you're not home. This is the kind of thing that would disgust me about anyone else.\n\nTruth: I've been rehearsing your death since our second date. When you ordered dessert, I thought: she believes in the future. I wanted to warn you about me then. How I catalog exits. How I love like the house is already on fire.\n\nYou want honesty? Fine. I still have the receipt from our first coffee. $8.47. I've done the math\u2014if I frame it, the UV damage will fade the ink completely in 94 years. I'll be dead by then, but someone will find it: a blank rectangle that once proved we began. This keeps me awake.\n\nHere's what loving you has done: Yesterday, I couldn't remember my mother's maiden name for three seconds. My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally. I forget words. I walk into walls. Last week, I put orange juice in my coffee and didn't notice until you came back and I could think again.\n\nThe proposal: Marry me because I've already paid the cost. My neurons have rewired. My sleep cycle has synchronized to yours. My immune system recognizes you as self, not other. Divorce would require medical intervention.\n\nMarry me because I know the exact temperature that makes you comfortable (71.5\u00b0F). Because I've memorized your parents' birthdays, your social security number (illegally), and the specific shade of pink your ears turn when lying. Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning. Because you steal my socks and I let you. Because we've achieved that terrible intimacy where you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about dogs.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because I've already built our whole life in my head and I need you to make it real before I forget what's memory and what's still just hope.\n\nI bought the ring two years ago. Week three of knowing you. Insane. I know. I've been carrying it like a tumor I'm fond of. It's in my pocket now. I'm in the next room. You're reading this on the kitchen table where I left it with your coffee (oat milk, half pump vanilla, crime against humanity but I love you anyway).\n\nThe ring belonged to my grandmother who married during the Depression. She said yes to my grandfather not because times were good but because \"when everything's ending, you might as well choose who you're ending with.\" \n\nWe have more time than they did. Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're already wearing it. You can't help yourself with surprises. Your tell is that you touch your hair when hiding something. You're doing it now.

Yet I must try, because silence would be a greater lie than any failed attempt at truth.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound reorganized the atoms of my universe. I've been trying to make you laugh ever since, not for the joke itself, but to witness that precise tilt of your head, the way your left eye crinkles slightly more than your right, how you cover your mouth as if beauty could be hidden.\n\nI love you in the ordinary moments\u2014when you forget I'm watching and become entirely yourself. The way you bite your lower lip reading difficult passages. How you unconsciously hum that melody from your childhood when you cook. The fierce concentration when you're solving problems, as if the world depends on it. Perhaps mine does.\n\nYou asked for truth. Here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing. I'm terrified of not being enough, of my words falling short, of time being finite when what I feel for you demands eternity. Some nights I lie awake calculating the hours we have left if we live to eighty, and the number always feels like theft.\n\nBut then morning comes, and you're there, and your presence makes cowards of my fears. We build our small forevers in coffee conversations, in shared silences that speak volumes, in the way our hands find each other without looking. You've taught me that love isn't a grand gesture but a thousand tiny choices to turn toward each other.\n\nI cannot promise you perfection. I can promise that when the world feels too heavy, I'll help you carry it. When joy arrives, I'll celebrate with you as if we've won the universe. When you doubt yourself, I'll be your mirror, reflecting back the brilliant truth of who you are.\n\nMarry me, not because I've written pretty words, but because you already know the answer in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before sleep when pretense falls away.
