I haven't been okay since the moment I met you. I've been catastrophically, irrevocably altered. \n\nListen: last night at 2 AM I found myself calculating the statistical probability of your existence. Seven billion people. The exact sequence of choices that led you to that coffee shop that Tuesday. The probability rounds to zero, Leyi. Zero. We shouldn't exist in the same timeline. But we do, and this impossible fact has reorganized my understanding of everything.\n\nI need to confess something. I document you. Not consciously\u2014my brain just does it. The way you hold your breath before you sneeze. How you always check your phone battery at exactly 44%. The specific way your voice drops half an octave when you're genuinely moved. I have become an involuntary archaeologist of your habits, and each discovered detail feels like proof of God or chaos or something bigger than both.\n\nYou want truth? I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not poetically terrified\u2014actually, medically, losing-sleep terrified. Because I've done the math: I will only get approximately 2,400 more Sundays with you if we live to eighty. That's it. 2,400 times to watch you make coffee wrong (milk first is insane, Leyi, but I'll die defending your right to do it). It's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.\n\nHere's what haunts me: before you, I was fine with silence. Now silence sounds like your absence. Before you, rain was weather. Now it's the sound that was playing when you told me about your father, really told me, and I understood that loving someone means inheriting their ghosts too. I want your ghosts, Leyi. All of them.\n\nI tried to find a metaphor for how I love you, but metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things. This can't. When you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one but the ugly-beautiful snort-laugh you're embarrassed by\u2014my neurons fire in patterns that shouldn't be survivable. When you're sad, my bones literally ache. I looked it up. It's called \"emotional contagion\" but that's too clinical for this cellular revolution you've caused.\n\nThe stupidest, truest thing: I love you most at your smallest. When you're sleepy and grumpy and your hair is doing that thing and you hate everyone except me. When you eat peanut butter straight from the jar at midnight and lie about it even though you're literally holding the spoon. When you cry at the part in that movie we've watched twelve times. These moments aren't poetry. They're evidence. Evidence that you're real, that this is real, that I'm not dreaming this impossible person into existence.\n\nI know I'm supposed to promise you the moon, eternal devotion, all that. But here's what I actually promise: I will choose you on the terrible days. The boring days. The days when we're both wrong but too stubborn to admit it. I will choose you when you're 87 and I'm 89 and we've forgotten why we're fighting but we're still holding hands anyway. I will choose you after the choosing stops feeling like a choice and becomes autonomic, like breathing, like blinking, like the way my mouth says your name even when I'm talking about something else.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014words are just noise we've agreed has meaning. Marry me because my cells recognize yours. Because when you're in the room, my breathing syncs to yours without trying. Because I've already spent the rest of my life with you in my head and I need the timeline to catch up. Because the thought of you reading this, right now, your face doing that thing where you're trying not to cry\u2014that thought is the most terrifying and necessary moment of my existence.\n\nI love you past language, past logic, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014something we don't have a word for because so few people ever feel it. You've turned me into an electric fence of feeling. I'm all current, no ground. \n\nThis is me, without metaphor: a man who learned what his heart was for the moment you aimed yours at mine.\n\nForever is a stupid concept but I'll take it anyway,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you just checked your phone battery. It's at 44%, isn't it? I know you, Leyi.

Not in some romantic way\u2014literally. That person feels fictional now. You didn't complete me; you demolished me and I rebuilt myself around the shape of loving you. Is that healthy? I don't care. \n\nI used to think love was about finding your other half. But I'm not half of anything\u2014I'm whole, and so are you, and somehow we've become this third thing that's bigger than addition. When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim. It's stupid. It's true.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes I look at you reading, lost in your book, and I get this pain in my chest like homesickness except I'm already home. You ARE home. Every other place is just waiting.\n\nI'm not good with words. I fix code, not hearts. But you make me want to be reckless with mine. So here it is, graceless and certain: Marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. But because I wake up every day and choose to earn you anyway. Because you make me want to be the person you seem to think I am. Because the thought of you reading this in bed while I sit here panicking is the most beautiful terror I've ever felt.\n\nI love you like a fact. Like gravity. Like breathing\u2014automatic and essential and so ordinary it's holy.\n\nPlease say yes. I built my whole life around the assumption that you would.\n\nYours (already, always),\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 2 (Score: 0.6340, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm bad at this. I've written seventeen versions and deleted them all because they sound like someone trying to sound like someone in love, not someone actually drowning in it.\n\nThe truth? Most nights I can't sleep because I'm afraid this is a dream. I touch your pillow when you're not here. I've memorized the pattern of your breathing\u2014it changes when you're about to wake up, gets lighter, like you're swimming up from somewhere deep. I know that's creepy. I don't care.\n\nI never told you this: that first Tuesday, after you left, I sat in my car for an hour because I couldn't remember how to drive. My hands wouldn't work right. Everything felt rearranged. You'd shifted something fundamental and I was terrified and exhilarated and I wanted to call my mother and tell her I'd found you, except I hadn't found you\u2014you'd happened to me, like weather, like gravity, like something I had no choice in.\n\nI love you wrong. I love you too much. I check if you're breathing in the middle of the night. I save your voicemails in three different places. When you got that paper cut last month, I felt it in my own finger. This isn't poetry\u2014this is confession. I am not proud of how completely you've dismantled me.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more than loving you: not loving you. Living in a world where I don't know that you hate cilantro but love the smell of it, where I don't get to watch you reorganize the bookshelf for the hundredth time, where your terrible dancing doesn't make me love you more, not less.\n\nI used to be whole. Now I'm not. You've ruined me and I'm grateful for the ruins. \n\nI don't have beautiful words. I don't have promises that sound like poetry. I just have this: every morning I wake up and choose to love you with whatever I have left, and somehow, impossibly, there's always more. You make me infinite by emptying me out.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because I can't breathe right when you're not here. Because my life before you feels like a rough draft I'm embarrassed by. Because I love you past the point of poetry, past the point of sense, into something stranger and truer and worth destroying myself for.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't beautiful. But it's real. And I'm betting everything that real is what you wanted.\n\nYours, utterly,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.5145, Type: Experimental)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are just shadows of what moves through me when I think of you. Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The sound carved itself into my bones. I catch myself smiling at nothing, just remembering. Or how you hold your coffee cup with both hands, like it's something precious, steam rising between us in the morning silence that needs no filling.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, declarations. But it's smaller than that, and infinite. It's how my breathing changes when I hear your key in the lock. It's the way loneliness has a different texture now\u2014not emptiness, but the specific shape of your absence. It's discovering that my future tense conjugates only in plural: we will, we might, we could.\n\nYou've rewritten the grammar of my existence. Before you, I was a complete sentence. Now I know I was just a fragment, waiting for the conjunction.\n\nI'm terrified and certain in equal measure. Terrified because you hold my entire life in your hands without knowing it. Certain because there's no other way I want to live.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a word\u2014but because I promise you this moment, and the next, and every small ordinary miraculous moment I'm given, choosing you again with each breath.\n\nWith a love that remakes me daily,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this at 4:13 AM because sleep is impossible when every cell in my body is rehearsing what to say to you. You wanted truth? Here's mine: I've written this letter 47 times. Deleted every version. This one stays because my hands won't let me erase it.\n\nYou know that moment when code finally compiles after hours of debugging? That split-second of pure relief? That's what I feel every time you walk through the door. Except it happens every single time. Three years, and my heart still does that stupid skip thing. I've Googled it. Apparently it's not medically concerning, just love.\n\nI need to tell you about Tuesday. You were reading on the couch, unconsciously braiding and unbraiding the same strand of hair. You do that when you're absorbed. I was supposed to be working but instead I watched you for seventeen minutes (I counted). And I thought: this is it. This is what I want at 3 PM on random Tuesdays for the rest of my life. You, lost in a book, while I pretend to work but really just marvel that you exist in the same timeline as me.\n\nHere's what you've done to me, Leyi: I save your voicemails. All of them. Even the one where you just pocket-dialed me and I listened to you arguing with the self-checkout machine for three minutes. I've memorized the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited. I know you're scared of butterflies but pretend you're not. I know you eat cereal at midnight when you can't sleep, always Lucky Charms, always straight from the box.\n\nBefore you, I was complete. I need you to know that. I was whole, functional, fine. But you didn't add to my life\u2014you multiplied it. Exponentially. You turned my black-and-white existence into something I don't have the color vocabulary to describe. You made me understand why people write symphonies and build cathedrals and do all those grand, stupid, necessary things for love.\n\nThe truth that terrifies me: I've built my entire future around the assumption that you're in it. Every plan I make has you as a constant. When I imagine old age, you're there, still mispronouncing words, still afraid of butterflies, still making me feel like I've won a lottery I never entered.\n\nSometimes you apologize for being \"too much.\" Too emotional, too complicated, too intense. But Leyi, you're not too much. You're exactly enough. You're my exact right amount of everything.\n\nSo here's my graceless, earnest truth: I love you with the desperation of someone who knows how improbable this is. Two people, finding each other in this vast chaos? The math alone should have prevented us. But here we are, against all odds, and I wake up every day still stunned by the miracle of you choosing me back.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you a perfect life\u2014I'm too flawed, too human for that. But because I promise to love you through every imperfect moment. Because you've turned my maybe into definitely, my someday into right now, my fine into extraordinary.\n\nI'm not good with words. But I'm good at loving you. It's the one thing I know I'm doing right in this life.\n\nPlease say yes. I already bought the ring. I've been carrying it around for six months like an idiot, waiting for the perfect moment. But you taught me perfect is just another word for procrastination. So here's my imperfect, sincere, shaking-hands proposal: Be my wife. Let me love you out loud, officially, forever.\n\nYours (already, always, obviously),\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying right now. The good kind, I hope. I have tissues in my jacket pocket.

I need to craft something that elevates all four dimensions while remaining devastatingly truthful.\n\nLet me write from a place of absolute vulnerability - the kind that makes you feel physically exposed:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI lied. Every time you asked if I was okay, I lied. I haven't been okay since the moment I met you. I've been catastrophically, irrevocably altered. \n\nListen: last night at 2 AM I found myself calculating the statistical probability of your existence. Seven billion people. The exact sequence of choices that led you to that coffee shop that Tuesday. The probability rounds to zero, Leyi. Zero. We shouldn't exist in the same timeline. But we do, and this impossible fact has reorganized my understanding of everything.\n\nI need to confess something. I document you. Not consciously\u2014my brain just does it. The way you hold your breath before you sneeze. How you always check your phone battery at exactly 44%. The specific way your voice drops half an octave when you're genuinely moved. I have become an involuntary archaeologist of your habits, and each discovered detail feels like proof of God or chaos or something bigger than both.\n\nYou want truth? I'm terrified of how much I love you. Not poetically terrified\u2014actually, medically, losing-sleep terrified. Because I've done the math: I will only get approximately 2,400 more Sundays with you if we live to eighty. That's it. 2,400 times to watch you make coffee wrong (milk first is insane, Leyi, but I'll die defending your right to do it). It's not enough. Infinity wouldn't be enough.\n\nHere's what haunts me: before you, I was fine with silence. Now silence sounds like your absence. Before you, rain was weather. Now it's the sound that was playing when you told me about your father, really told me, and I understood that loving someone means inheriting their ghosts too. I want your ghosts, Leyi. All of them.\n\nI tried to find a metaphor for how I love you, but metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things. This can't. When you laugh\u2014really laugh, not the polite one but the ugly-beautiful snort-laugh you're embarrassed by\u2014my neurons fire in patterns that shouldn't be survivable. When you're sad, my bones literally ache. I looked it up. It's called \"emotional contagion\" but that's too clinical for this cellular revolution you've caused.\n\nThe stupidest, truest thing: I love you most at your smallest. When you're sleepy and grumpy and your hair is doing that thing and you hate everyone except me. When you eat peanut butter straight from the jar at midnight and lie about it even though you're literally holding the spoon. When you cry at the part in that movie we've watched twelve times. These moments aren't poetry. They're evidence. Evidence that you're real, that this is real, that I'm not dreaming this impossible person into existence.\n\nI know I'm supposed to promise you the moon, eternal devotion, all that. But here's what I actually promise: I will choose you on the terrible days. The boring days. The days when we're both wrong but too stubborn to admit it. I will choose you when you're 87 and I'm 89 and we've forgotten why we're fighting but we're still holding hands anyway. I will choose you after the choosing stops feeling like a choice and becomes autonomic, like breathing, like blinking, like the way my mouth says your name even when I'm talking about something else.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you\u2014words are just noise we've agreed has meaning. Marry me because my cells recognize yours. Because when you're in the room, my breathing syncs to yours without trying. Because I've already spent the rest of my life with you in my head and I need the timeline to catch up. Because the thought of you reading this, right now, your face doing that thing where you're trying not to cry\u2014that thought is the most terrifying and necessary moment of my existence.\n\nI love you past language, past logic, past the point where love becomes something else\u2014something we don't have a word for because so few people ever feel it. You've turned me into an electric fence of feeling. I'm all current, no ground. \n\nThis is me, without metaphor: a man who learned what his heart was for the moment you aimed yours at mine.\n\nForever is a stupid concept but I'll take it anyway,\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you just checked your phone battery. It's at 44%, isn't it? I know you, Leyi. That's the only miracle I need.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
