That watching you turn chaos into order\u2014your hands making those precise, economic movements\u2014was like watching the universe invent mathematics. That the way you paired socks (rolling them into perfect spirals) made me understand why humans invented the word \"sacred.\" That I wanted to build a cathedral around that ordinary Tuesday moment and worship there forever.\n\nI used to be brave, Leyi. I free-climbed mountains, debugged code at 4 AM, moved cities without looking back. But now? Now I check your breathing seventeen times a night.

Even the stars we named that August are already dead, their light just hasn't admitted it yet.\n\nYou want truth? I've been writing my wedding vows since our third date. They're hidden in a folder labeled \"Tax Documents 2019.\" Twenty-seven versions. In version twelve, I promise to learn the language your sadness speaks. In version twenty, I vow to be the place your joy comes home to.

I'm a sovereign nation of two.\n\nDo you remember what you said about the moon last week? That it was \"showing off, wearing all that light like costume jewelry.\" That's when I knew. Not that I loved you\u2014I've known that since you mispronounced \"epitome\" with such confidence I wanted to change the dictionary. I knew that you had turned me into something I don't have a name for. Not a lover. Not a partner. Something more primitive and permanent. Like how hydrogen needs oxygen. Like how sound needs air.\n\nThe truth is, I've already married you a thousand times. In the cereal aisle when you couldn't decide between Corn Flakes and Lucky Charms so you got both. In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me. We've been married in all the ways that matter. This proposal is just paperwork for a union that predates language.\n\nBut I need you to know what you're agreeing to: I will love you badly.

I will love you selfishly, greedily, like a child who hasn't learned to share. I will love you past the point of poetry into pure animal need.

I didn't move for three hours. My arm went completely numb and I thought: this is it. This is what religions are built on.\n\nI need you to understand something: I was a functioning adult before you. I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months. While you're brushing your teeth (exactly 2 minutes, 15 seconds, you count in your head). While you're reading and your eyebrows do that thing\u2014you know the thing\u2014where they furrow and unfurrow like you're having a whole conversation with the author. I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work. I'm proposing more Tuesday nights that feel like New Year's Eve and Sunday mornings that feel like prayer. I'm proposing that we keep becoming whoever we're becoming, but do it together, on purpose, with witnesses.\n\nMy love, my terror, my home\u2014will you marry me? Not because I deserve you (I don't), but because I've already started living in our future, and it's the only address I ever want to have.\n\nYours in this life and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S.

You said \"even beauty dies\" and I couldn't speak because I was terrified you were right. But then you made instant ramen at midnight, adding an egg exactly how your grandmother taught you, and I understood: beauty doesn't die, it just changes form. Like how your sadness becomes my purpose. Like how your laugh\u2014that specific hiccup-giggle when you're truly surprised\u2014rewrites the laws of physics in my chest.\n\nI used to think love was grand gestures, symphonies, monuments. But it's smaller than that. It's knowing you need exactly 2.5 sugars in your coffee (never 2, never 3). It's the way you unconsciously trace figure-eights on my palm during scary movies. It's how you mispronounce \"particularly\" as \"par-tic-a-larly\" when you're excited, and how I've never corrected you because that small imperfection is holy to me.\n\nSometimes I catch myself studying you like an equation I'll never solve. Not because you're complicated\u2014because you're infinite. Each time I think I've mapped your depths, you reveal another room in your heart I didn't know existed. Like last Thursday, when you fed that stray cat even though you're allergic. You sneezed for an hour, eyes streaming, insisting you were fine. That's when I knew: I don't just love you. I love the way you love the world, recklessly, despite the cost.\n\nIf I could distill us into one moment, it would be this: that night the power went out and we slow-danced to the hum of the refrigerator. You said, \"This is enough music,\" and I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014I would choose that broken music with you over all the orchestras of heaven without you.\n\nI am not a poet. I am an anxious man in a small room, trying to fit an ocean of feeling into the container of words. But here is my truth: you have colonized my entire existence. My cells divide in your honor. My neurons fire in the pattern of your name. When archaeologists find my bones centuries from now, they will carbon-date them to the exact moment I first loved you, because that's when I truly began.\n\nMarry me, not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is just a concept. Marry me for the tangible now: for Sunday crosswords we'll never finish, for the arguments about whether tomatoes belong in the fridge, for the thousand tiny deaths and rebirths we'll share as we grow old and strange together.\n\nI am terrified.

I already bought the ring. It's hidden in the frozen peas. You were right\u2014I am terrible at secrets. But this one, this question, this crystallized terror in my throat\u2014this I've been carrying since the first time you laughed at my worst joke. Say yes. Say yes so I can finally exhale.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
