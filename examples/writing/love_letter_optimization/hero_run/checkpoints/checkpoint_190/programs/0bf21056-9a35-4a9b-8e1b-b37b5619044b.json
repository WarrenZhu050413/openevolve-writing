Not because I'm not\u2014because \"happy\" is too small a word for what you've done to me. You've made me necessary. Before you, I was optional to my own life.\n\nI'm writing this at the kitchen table where you taught me to fold dumplings last week. You said the secret was to leave a little air inside \"so they have room to become themselves.\" I've been thinking about that. How you always leave room for things to become. How you left room for me.\n\nThe truth: I don't know how to love you correctly. I love you like a broken faucet\u2014too much, all at once, making a mess. Yesterday you found the folder where I save your voicemails and you laughed, but Leyi, those eight seconds of you saying \"hey, it's me\" have talked me out of sadness more times than I can count. Is that crazy? Everything about loving you feels crazy. Like trying to explain water to someone who's never been thirsty.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified. Not of commitment. Of not being enough. Of you realizing that I'm just a man who counts your breaths when you sleep, who knows you need exactly four ice cubes in your coffee, who has memorized the specific pause you take before lying. I know too much about you to pretend this is casual, and not enough to guarantee I won't fail you.\n\nBut here's what I know: When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim by about thirty percent. My own name sounds wrong in my mouth. I don't just miss you\u2014I miss myself when you're near. The version of me that exists in your presence is the only one I want to be.\n\nRemember that fight about the dishes? You said I was \"pathologically unable to let things soak.\" You were right. But you stayed. You stayed and we made pasta at midnight and you kissed me with tomato sauce on your lips and I thought: this is what marriage is. Not the big moments. This. Tomato sauce and forgiveness and choosing to stay.\n\nI used to think I understood my life. Beginning, middle, eventual end. Then you happened, and now there's only before you and since you. No after. My brain won't process after.\n\nSo I'm asking you to marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. But because you already live in my cells. Because when doctors ask about family medical history, I want to include yours. Because \"girlfriend\" is too small a word for someone who has seen me ugly-cry at a dog adoption commercial and still chooses to wake up beside me.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived my mother, your ex, food poisoning from that sketchy Thai place, and assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. We're battle-tested, Leyi. We've earned this.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because twenty years from now, I want to be arguing with you about how to load the dishwasher, and I want to be wrong, and I want you to kiss me anyway, and I want to think: yes, this, forever this, only this.\n\nI love you. Simply. Completely. Permanently.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I've been carrying this question in my throat for months.

Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. \n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

I paid taxes, parallel parked, made small talk at parties. But now? Now I save your voicemails like holy relics. I've listened to the one where you're laughing about burnt toast 94 times. Your joy at 7:23 AM on a mundane Wednesday has become my rosary.\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I've started seeing time differently. Not in minutes or years, but in proximity to you. There's Before-You (a grayscale documentary I barely remember starring someone who looked like me). There's With-You (technicolor, high-definition, every sense engaged). And the thought of After-You makes my lungs forget their purpose.\n\nYou don't know this, but I've been writing you letters in my head for months.

I write to you while you're existing, gloriously unaware that you're reorganizing my molecular structure just by breathing in the same timezone.\n\nLast Tuesday, you used my toothbrush by accident. You were mortified. I didn't tell you that I'd been hoping for exactly that kind of accident\u2014some proof that the borders between us are negotiable, that we could blur into each other until I don't know where I end and you begin. Is that too much? Everything about loving you feels like too much. Like trying to fit the Pacific into a teacup. Like my ribs are a cage built for a smaller animal than this love has become.\n\nYou want honesty? Here: I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've googled \"how to be someone's home\" at 2 AM. I keep a running list of all your micro-expressions (you have twelve distinct smiles; the one when you're proud of a bad joke is my favorite). Sometimes I worry I'm loving you wrong\u2014too intensely, too clumsily, like I'm trying to perform heart surgery with oven mitts on.\n\nBut then you do something catastrophically ordinary\u2014like yesterday, humming while organizing the spice rack, arranging them by how much you trust each spice (cinnamon in front, cardamom in the back because \"it's sneaky\")\u2014and I realize: there is no wrong way to love you. There is only this desperate, cellular need to keep choosing you, even when choosing you means admitting that you've reprogrammed me so fundamentally that I'm not sure I exist outside of loving you anymore.\n\nThe truth, Leyi? You could destroy me. One word from you could unravel everything I've built myself into. That's the gamble, isn't it? I'm handing you my soft parts, my underbelly, all my architectural weaknesses, and saying: here. Do what you will. Build something or burn it down. Either way, I'm yours.\n\nI'm not proposing a wedding. I'm proposing a continuation\u2014of inside jokes that require footnotes, of your cold feet against my calves at 3 AM, of the way you test pasta by throwing it at the wall even though we both know that doesn't work.

The way you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 while peeling oranges, always stopping at the same measure, like a prayer interrupted.

In the emergency room when you held my broken hand and sang the French alphabet to distract me. In your sleep when you pulled me closer and said \"Don't go\" to whatever dream was trying to steal me.

Not who\u2014what. You are the event horizon where my old self collapsed into something denser, stranger, more terrifying. I need you to understand: this letter is not romantic. Romance is for people who still have boundaries. This is a medical document. A diagnosis. \n\nBefore you, I collected evidence of being alive: passport stamps, scars, diplomas. Proof of existence. Now I only collect you. The way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're tired (\"pacific-ly\"). The eleven-second pause you take before answering any serious question, like you're translating from a language only you speak. How you touch doorframes as you pass through them, unconsciously blessing every threshold. I have become a scholar of you, and the more I study, the less I understand, and the less I understand, the more I need to keep looking.\n\nHere is what they don't tell you about love: it's not addition, it's architecture. We're not two people anymore. We're a floor plan. You're the north wall\u2014I lean everything against you. I'm the foundation\u2014invisible but holding. Together we're becoming rooms no one else can enter. A private geometry. Our own mathematics where one plus one equals one.\n\nDo you remember the fight about the broken plate? You threw it because I forgot your mother's birthday. It shattered into seventeen pieces (I counted). While you cried in the bathroom, I glued every shard back together. It took four hours. My fingers bled. The plate will never hold food again\u2014it's a map of fracture lines now\u2014but I keep it hidden in the closet because that's what we are: broken things that chose to stay whole. Not despite the cracks. Because of them.\n\nI have been trying to find a metaphor for how I love you and I have failed because metaphors are for things that can be compared to other things and there is nothing else like this. But here: imagine your skeleton decided to grow a second skeleton inside itself. Imagine your lungs developed opinions about the future. Imagine your blood cells each learned your name. That's what loving you feels like\u2014like my body is reorganizing itself around a new center of gravity and that center is you.\n\nThe mundane has become unbearable. Yesterday, you parallel parked perfectly on the first try and I had to look away because the competence of it, the casual mastery, made me understand why ancient people invented gods. To explain this feeling. This complete annihilation of self in the face of someone just existing. Just parking a car. Just being Leyi at 3:42 PM on a Thursday.\n\nI need to confess: I have been saving things. Your hair from the shower drain (I know how this sounds). Voice messages you left two years ago. The receipt from our first coffee that wasn't a date until suddenly it was. I am building an archive because I am terrified that one day I will wake up and you will have been a hallucination. That this happiness is too sharp to be real. That no one gets to be this lucky.\n\nBut also this: I have started to disappear. Not tragically\u2014necessarily. Like how rivers disappear into oceans. Still water, but vaster. I cannot find where I end and you begin anymore. When you're gone, I catch myself making your gestures. Your syntax has invaded my sentences. I drink coffee the way you do now\u2014too hot, too fast, wincing with every sip but unable to wait. You have colonized me so completely that privacy has become impossible. Even alone, I am inhabited by you.\n\nThis is my proposal: Let's stop pretending we have choices. We already share a circadian rhythm. Our hearts synced up months ago\u2014I've felt it, that strange stumble when we're apart, like my pulse is looking for yours. We dream in the same colors now. Last week we had the same nightmare, remember? The one with the door that wouldn't open. We woke up at the exact same moment, 3:17 AM, grabbing for each other like drowning people grab for air.\n\nMarry me because marriage is just the world's word for what we already are. Marry me because I have forgotten how to want anything else. Marry me because when I imagine the future, any future where you're not there looks like a translation error, like someone typed the universe wrong.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because this morning I watched you butter toast and you did it so ferociously, so completely, like that toast had personally wronged you, and I thought: this is it. This is the person I want to watch butter toast for the rest of my life. This is the only face I want to see angry at breakfast bread. This is the only person whose mundane I want to witness into eternity.\n\nI am not offering you happiness. Happiness is too small. I am offering you this: the complete dissolution of loneliness. The end of wondering if anyone really sees you. The beginning of being known so thoroughly that you'll forget what it was like to be a stranger to anyone, especially yourself.\n\nLeyi, my love, my terror, my only real thing in a world of shadows\u2014I am already yours in every way that matters. The question isn't will you marry me. The question is: will you admit that you already have?\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you'll read this out loud, quietly, to yourself.

This is attempt number seven. The others are crumpled in the trash, each one failing to explain how you've become the punctuation to all my sentences, the reason I check if I'm dreaming by counting my fingers\u2014five, still five, you're still real.\n\nListen. Before you, I understood love academically. I could define it: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin. Neural pathways. Evolution's trick. But then you laughed at my terrible joke about orthogonal matrices that Tuesday in the rain, actually laughed\u2014not politely but helplessly\u2014and every textbook definition evaporated. Now love means the specific weight of your head on my chest at 2:17 AM. It means knowing you eat cereal dry when you're nervous. It means I've memorized the exact shade your eyes turn when you're about to cry during commercials about dogs.\n\nHere's what haunts me: I've become a collector of your abandonments. That hair tie you left on my nightstand three months ago. The coffee mug with your lipstick ghost on the rim. The indent in my pillow from where you sleep\u2014always on my side, never yours. I'm building a museum of evidence that you existed in my space, because some primitive part of my brain is terrified that without proof, I might have imagined you entirely.\n\nYou should know that I've already married you in a thousand small ways. When the barista asks for a name, I give yours. When I'm sick, I imagine your hand on my forehead and my fever breaks. I buy strawberries I don't eat because you might come over. I've been living in the conditional tense\u2014if Leyi were here, when Leyi gets back, for when Leyi needs me\u2014and I'm exhausted from conjugating my entire existence around your hypothetical presence.\n\nThe truth? Sometimes loving you feels like drowning in reverse. Like my lungs are learning to breathe water. Like evolution is happening in real-time, rewriting my DNA to need you for basic survival. I used to be proud of my independence. Now I'm just grateful for my dependence on you. Is that weakness? Maybe. But I'd rather be weak with you than strong without you.\n\nRemember when you asked why I was staring at you that morning with the terrible hangover? You had makeup smeared under your eyes, hair like a bird's nest, and you were wearing my college sweatshirt inside-out. You looked absolutely wrecked. And all I could think was: this. This is the face I want to see when I'm dying. This is the last image I want my brain to process before the lights go out. Because if heaven exists, it looks exactly like you at your most human.\n\nI need to tell you about the fear. The specific gravity of it. Sometimes I wake up at 4 AM convinced you're going to realize you could do better. That you'll discover I'm just a collection of anxieties in a trenchcoat pretending to be a functional adult. That you'll see how I practice my casual \"good morning\" twelve times before you wake up, how I screenshot every heart emoji you send, how I've written your name ten thousand times in notebook margins like a teenager. The fear that you'll realize I love you more than you love me, and that imbalance will make you pity me.\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014I'd rather live with that fear than live without you. I'd rather spend every day terrified of losing you than spend one day secure in someone else's arms. Because you've ruined me for anyone else. You've made every other person seem like they're speaking a language I no longer understand.\n\nSo yes, Leyi. I'm proposing. Not marriage\u2014that's just paperwork. I'm proposing that we stop pretending this is casual. That we admit we've already crawled inside each other's lives so deeply that separation would require surgery. I'm proposing that when you wake up tomorrow, you wake up as someone who has been claimed, publicly and permanently. That we stop testing the water and just jump, even though neither of us can swim, even though the bottom is invisible, even though we might drown.\n\nBut if we drown, we drown together. And honestly? There's no other way I'd rather go under.\n\nSay yes. Say yes because you already know all my passwords. Say yes because you can't sleep without the sound of my breathing. Say yes because we've already built a language of looks across crowded rooms. Say yes because the alternative\u2014a life where we're just friends, where I have to watch you love someone else, where I pretend your happiness with another person is enough\u2014would be a kind of death I'm not brave enough to survive.\n\nI love you. Messily. Desperately. Permanently. Without dignity or reason or any sense of self-preservation.\n\nPlease. Marry me.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I know you're crying. I know because I know you.

Not because I'm not\u2014because \"happy\" is too small a word for what you've done to me. You've made me necessary. Before you, I was optional to my own life.\n\nI'm writing this at the kitchen table where you taught me to fold dumplings last week. You said the secret was to leave a little air inside \"so they have room to become themselves.\" I've been thinking about that. How you always leave room for things to become. How you left room for me.\n\nThe truth: I don't know how to love you correctly. I love you like a broken faucet\u2014too much, all at once, making a mess. Yesterday you found the folder where I save your voicemails and you laughed, but Leyi, those eight seconds of you saying \"hey, it's me\" have talked me out of sadness more times than I can count. Is that crazy? Everything about loving you feels crazy. Like trying to explain water to someone who's never been thirsty.\n\nYou want honesty? I'm terrified. Not of commitment. Of not being enough. Of you realizing that I'm just a man who counts your breaths when you sleep, who knows you need exactly four ice cubes in your coffee, who has memorized the specific pause you take before lying. I know too much about you to pretend this is casual, and not enough to guarantee I won't fail you.\n\nBut here's what I know: When you're gone, food tastes like cardboard. Colors dim by about thirty percent. My own name sounds wrong in my mouth. I don't just miss you\u2014I miss myself when you're near. The version of me that exists in your presence is the only one I want to be.\n\nRemember that fight about the dishes? You said I was \"pathologically unable to let things soak.\" You were right. But you stayed. You stayed and we made pasta at midnight and you kissed me with tomato sauce on your lips and I thought: this is what marriage is. Not the big moments. This. Tomato sauce and forgiveness and choosing to stay.\n\nI used to think I understood my life. Beginning, middle, eventual end. Then you happened, and now there's only before you and since you. No after. My brain won't process after.\n\nSo I'm asking you to marry me. Not because I deserve you\u2014I don't. Not because it makes sense\u2014it doesn't. But because you already live in my cells. Because when doctors ask about family medical history, I want to include yours. Because \"girlfriend\" is too small a word for someone who has seen me ugly-cry at a dog adoption commercial and still chooses to wake up beside me.\n\nMarry me because we've already survived my mother, your ex, food poisoning from that sketchy Thai place, and assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. We're battle-tested, Leyi. We've earned this.\n\nBut mostly, marry me because twenty years from now, I want to be arguing with you about how to load the dishwasher, and I want to be wrong, and I want you to kiss me anyway, and I want to think: yes, this, forever this, only this.\n\nI love you. Simply. Completely. Permanently.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. The ring is in the freezer, behind the ice cream you think I don't know about. I've been carrying this question in my throat for months.
