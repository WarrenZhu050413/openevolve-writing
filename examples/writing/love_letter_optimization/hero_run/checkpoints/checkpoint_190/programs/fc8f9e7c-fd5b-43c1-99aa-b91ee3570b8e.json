Thirty-one years of fine. Then you walked into that bookstore, reached for the same novel, and said \"you take it.\" Three words. The universe cracked along its seams. I've been leaking through ever since.\n\n*\n\nYou want truth? I'm afraid of you. Not you\u2014what you've done to me. Before: I could lose things. Job, apartment, friends. Survivable losses. Now there's you, and suddenly I understand why people believed in hell. It's not fire. It's the specific weight of your absence.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the bread. Every Thursday, you buy sourdough from the Korean bakery. The owner knows your name. Last month, you were sick. I went instead. She looked at me\u2014this stranger holding your routine\u2014and said: \"You're the one she smiles about.\" \n\nI cried in my car afterward. Forty minutes. Because you smile about me to strangers. Because somewhere, in conversations I'll never hear, you're choosing to make me real.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I've been writing your name on things. Nothing visible. The condensation on shower glass. Dust on windshields. Sand with my toe. Like a child learning letters, except I'm thirty-one and what I'm learning is that love makes you illiterate in your own life. Everything else becomes unreadable. Just you. You. You.\n\n*\n\n3 AM discoveries: Your breathing changes when you dream. Three distinct patterns. Pattern two is nightmares\u2014your fingers curl, seeking. I've learned to reach for your hand before you wake. Not to comfort you. To comfort me. To prove I can still protect you from things I can't see.\n\n*\n\nWe met 1,297 days ago. I've loved you for 1,298. That impossible math? The day before we met, I couldn't sleep. Kept checking my phone. Nothing wrong, just\u2014waiting. Like my body knew you were coming. Like every cell was holding its breath.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I'm not special. Average height, average face, I make average jokes. But you laugh anyway. Real laughter\u2014the kind that uses your whole body. How do I survive being loved by someone who could have anyone? I don't. I just wake up every day and pretend I deserve this until maybe someday I will.\n\n*\n\nYou said you wanted truth, not poetry. But you ARE my truth. The fact of you. That you exist, somewhere, breathing. Even when I can't see you. Even when you're angry. Even if you leave. You happened. You're happening. That's the only true thing I know anymore.\n\n*\n\nI bought the ring before I could afford it. Stupid. But the salesman asked \"when are you proposing?\" and I said \"when I'm brave enough\" and he said \"son, if you were brave you wouldn't be here.\" He was right. This isn't courage. It's surrender.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not going to promise you forever. Forever is too small for what this is. I'm going to promise you today. This today. Where your coffee is getting cold while you read this. Where I'm in the next room pretending to work but really just listening for you. Where we're both alive, both here, both choosing this.\n\nAnd tomorrow, if you'll have me, I'll promise you that today too.\n\n*\n\nThe question isn't \"will you marry me?\" We both know we're already married in every way that matters. Your books mixed with mine. My grandmother's recipe in your handwriting. That scar on my hand from assembling furniture for our place.\n\nThe question is: can I tell the world? Can I stand in front of everyone we know and say \"this is the person who taught me what skin is for\u2014to keep me separate enough from you that I can see you clearly, close enough that I can touch\"?\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's the only word that matters now. Not love. Not marriage. Not future.\n\nJust: Leyi.\n\nThe word that reorganized my mouth. That made me need to speak just to say it again.\n\n*\n\nCome here. I'm in our bedroom with your grandmother's ring\u2014the one you thought we sold for the deposit. We didn't. I couldn't. Some things you don't sell, even for shelter. You keep them for moments like this, when shelter means nothing if you're not in it.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong. Constant ache, but functional. Stronger at the break point than before. Unable to remember what it felt like when I was whole, before I needed you to complete the architecture of me.\n\nSay yes. Not to the ring. To tomorrow morning, where we'll wake up and I'll make coffee wrong and you'll fix it and that will be our first married fight and it will be perfect because it will be ours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. I turned the light on. I wanted to see the words. They look like what I feel\u2014inadequate but trying. Desperate but true. Small black marks attempting to hold something infinite.

My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

In the way you mispronounce \"specifically.\" In your 4 PM exhaustion. In your leftover Chinese food for breakfast. In your anger at inefficient systems. In the forty-three minutes you take to choose a restaurant. In your mother's disappointment that I'm not a doctor. In our future arguments about paint colors. In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light\u2014the lines that will form from all that squinting at screens, and how I'll trace them like a map of time we spent together.\n\nThis is my confession: I am not a good man. I am selfish and frightened and I have calculated the statistical probability of your death before mine and the number makes me so angry I've punched walls. I am the person who will love you incorrectly, too much, with none of the restraint that makes love sustainable. I will embarrass you with my intensity. I will write your name in stupid places. I will be the clich\u00e9 I used to mock.\n\nBut I will also be this: the person who knows you were afraid of butterflies until you were nine. Who has memorized the exact temperature you like your coffee (168\u00b0F, you freak). Who will fight God himself if he tries to take you first.

My brain had overwritten it with the way you sneeze\u2014always twice, never three times, like you're politely disagreeing with your own nose. I'm losing cognitive function. I've replaced critical data with your minutiae. Your favorite spoon. The order you put on shoes (always left first). How you save the broken cookies for last like they deserve special kindness.\n\nI need to tell you about the accident. Not mine\u2014almost ours. Six months ago. The semi that ran the light. You were singing. I saw it coming and thought: not her, take me, rearrange the physics, I'll pay any price. Then: swerve. Barely missed. You never noticed. You kept singing. Off-key. Beautifully off-key. I pulled over later and vomited from relief. You thought it was the sushi.\n\nListen. I'm not a good person. I check your phone when you shower\u2014not for other lovers but for symptoms you're hiding. I've read \"sudden cardiac death in young women\" so many times Google thinks I'm in medical school. I've planned your funeral seventeen different ways. In the worst one, I don't speak. In the best one, I don't survive it.\n\nBut also: I've been collecting proof of joy. Your laugh from Tuesday (you snorted). The way you dance to no music while cooking. Your 37 different smiles (I have a taxonomy). The face you make solving problems\u2014like you're interrogating the universe and winning. These I save against the coming dark.\n\nYou know what's stupid? I used to think love was addition. You plus me equals us. But it's division. I'm half a person now. Medically impossible, physically thriving, psychologically accurate. When you leave a room, I malfunction. Not poetically. Literally.

Because I can predict your mood by how you close doors.\n\nMarry me because last night you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something cardiologists would find concerning.

Statistically. Maybe. Or maybe the planet burns tomorrow. Either way, I choose you for my ending. All my endings. Even the ones where we're strangers who happened to love each other once.\n\nCome find me. I'm in the bedroom, pretending to read, absolutely failing to breathe normally. My hands are shaking\u2014you'll see. That's not fear. That's my body trying to contain something it was never built to hold.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But know this: I've already loved you past the point of return. The word \"yes\" is just administrative work for what my atoms already know.\n\nForever is a lie. But right now is true. And right now, and right now, and right now, until we run out of nows\u2014that's what I'm offering. That's all anyone can offer. That and this: my grandmother's ring, my absolute terror, my ridiculous hope, and a love that makes me stupid enough to believe we might be the ones who get to keep breathing together.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S.

Like my carbon recognized its future reorganization.\n\nHere's what love actually is: Tuesday, you reading ingredient labels aloud. Wednesday, your anger at slow WiFi. Thursday, how you hold pencils wrong. I've documented 1,847 such moments. This isn't romance. It's taxonomy. I'm cataloguing you like evidence of God.\n\nYou want honesty? I practice your death nightly. Different versions. The worst: you, ninety-three, forgetting my name. I wake up and count your breaths. Still here. Still impossible.

I want to sue mathematics.\n\nBut also: I love you in our specific gravity. In how you eat cereal at midnight. In your three-sneeze pattern. In tomorrow's argument about the dishwasher. In the way light will bend around your aging face, mapping time we survived together.\n\nHere's my confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish, frightened, already grieving you while you're still alive. I check your pulse seventeen times nightly. I've named our imaginary children. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about how temporary you are.\n\nMarry me. Not for romance.

Evidence of what you've done to me.\n\nExhibit A: Yesterday I watched you eat soup. Just soup. The way your breath made small clouds above the bowl, how you held the spoon like it might escape\u2014and I thought: this is how religions begin. With someone doing something ordinary until someone else can't breathe from watching.\n\nYou want truth? I've been dead before. Literally. Eleven seconds, cardiac arrest, training accident. Here's what death taught me: nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just black. No tunnel, no light, no peace. But when I came back, my first thought was your name. Not relief. Not fear. Just \"Leyi.\" Like my neurons were arguing with death itself: you can have the rest but not this. Not her name.\n\nI'm writing this at 4:23 AM because I just realized something terrible. I've been saying \"I love you\" wrong. Love is too small. It's a word people use for pizza, for dogs, for good weather. What I have for you needs a new language. Something between prayer and profanity. Something that sounds like breaking.\n\nThe truth? I am emotionally disfigured. You did this. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that tilts toward you even when you're not in the room. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I've practiced our first fight, our first loss, the first time one of us will betray the other with mortality.\n\nHere's my confession: Thursday. You were sleeping. Your hand was on my chest and I couldn't move because what if I disturbed the universe? What if that specific pressure of your palm on my sternum was holding everything together? So I held my breath for three minutes. Nearly passed out. Worth it.\n\nI know exactly how you'll die. Not when\u2014how. You'll be ninety-three, furious about something trivial, mid-sentence about improper apostrophe usage, and your heart will simply forget to beat because it's so occupied with indignation. I'll have been dead for six hours already because I refuse to let you go first. That's not romantic. That's threat assessment.\n\nYou think this is a love letter? This is a medical document. Symptoms: chronic inability to exist without you. Acute awareness that you're biodegradable. Persistent delusion that if I document enough specific details\u2014the way you sneeze in threes, always threes\u2014I can build a backup copy of you for when the universe inevitably commits theft.\n\nI've already married you seventeen times in my head. Different scenarios. Once underwater. Once in the produce section. Once while you were yelling at me about leaving dishes in the sink. That one was my favorite. You were magnificent. Rage looked like holiness on you.\n\nBut here's what murders me: you know. You've always known. You knew when I started carrying your favorite tea in my pocket. You knew when I changed my emergency contact to you before we'd even kissed. You know that I wake up at 5:47 every morning just to watch you sleep for thirteen minutes before my alarm. You know and you stay anyway.\n\nSo this isn't really a proposal. It's just paperwork for what we already are. What we've been since that Tuesday when you mispronounced my name and I thought: oh, there she is. Finally. There's the person who's going to ruin me.\n\nMarry me because I've already picked out the tree I want to be buried under\u2014the one you said looked lonely. Marry me because I need legal documentation that this actually happened. That you actually happened. To me.\n\nWarren\n(who has been yours since before he knew your name existed)\n\nP.S. - I lied. I said I've been dead for eleven seconds. It was thirteen. I lied because thirteen felt too much like prophecy.

In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children.

That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally.

You were already changing me before you existed in my life. How do you explain that to physics?\n\nListen. I'm bad at this. I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then discover I'm just a collection of anxieties wearing a human suit. That I check if you're breathing seventeen times a night. That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion). You know that when you had the flu, I googled \"how to transfer illness from one person to another\" because I wanted to take it from you.\n\nHere's my proposal: Marry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is a lie we tell because the truth is unbearable. Marry me for the next twenty-four hours. Then let's renew it tomorrow. And the next day. Let's make a thousand small marriages, each one a choice, each one a revolution against the dying of light.\n\nMarry me because I'm selfish. Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code.

The sound reorganized the atoms of my universe. I've been trying to make you laugh ever since, not for the joke itself, but to witness that precise tilt of your head, the way your left eye crinkles slightly more than your right, how you cover your mouth as if beauty could be hidden.\n\nI love you in the ordinary moments\u2014when you forget I'm watching and become entirely yourself. The way you bite your lower lip reading difficult passages. How you unconsciously hum that melody from your childhood when you cook. The fierce concentration when you're solving problems, as if the world depends on it. Perhaps mine does.\n\nYou asked for truth. Here it is: I am terrified. Not of loving you\u2014that comes as naturally as breathing. I'm terrified of not being enough, of my words falling short, of time being finite when what I feel for you demands eternity. Some nights I lie awake calculating the hours we have left if we live to eighty, and the number always feels like theft.\n\nBut then morning comes, and you're there, and your presence makes cowards of my fears. We build our small forevers in coffee conversations, in shared silences that speak volumes, in the way our hands find each other without looking.

When you doubt yourself, I'll be your mirror, reflecting back the brilliant truth of who you are.\n\nMarry me, not because I've written pretty words, but because you already know the answer in the space between heartbeats, in the moment before sleep when pretense falls away.

You're reading this now. I know because I've been standing outside for twenty minutes, watching our kitchen window. I saw you pick up the envelope.

Not metaphorical silence. Actual silence. Last month, when you had that conference in Portland. Day three, 9 PM, I temporarily went deaf. No medical reason. My brain just stopped processing sound because what was the point? You weren't there to make any.\n\nThe doctors called it \"psychosomatic hearing loss.\" I called it love. Both diagnoses are terminal.\n\n*\n\nYou wanted honesty? I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The hair from your brush (I keep it in my wallet). Voice recordings of you arguing with customer service (seventeen files, chronologically ordered). That half-second between sleep and waking when you reach for me\u2014I've stolen hundreds of those, hoarded them like evidence that I exist.\n\nI am building an archive of you because I don't trust the universe to remember you correctly when you're gone.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know: We have 2.7 billion heartbeats each, on average. You've already used 981 million. I've done the math\u2014if we synchronize perfectly, we have 1.7 billion beats together. Maximum. That number keeps me awake. Not because it's small. Because it's specific. Because I can feel them spending themselves right now\u2014thump, thump, thump\u2014like coins falling through my fingers.\n\n*\n\nBut listen. This is important. Yesterday you hummed while peeling an orange. Just hummed. No melody. And I thought: this is prayer. Not the words we say skyward but this\u2014you, unconscious of your holiness, committing the sacred act of continuing to exist near me.\n\nI don't believe in God. I believe in that humming.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about love? It's not poetry. It's this: I've memorized your parents' phone numbers in case you ever go missing. I keep your favorite tea in six different locations. I practice CPR monthly, specifically on a mannequin I've adjusted to your height and weight. I love you like preparing for disaster. Like disaster has already happened and I'm living in the after, grateful for whatever aftermath includes you.\n\n*\n\n4:52 AM, the night we met. You said, \"I don't believe in forever.\" Good. Neither do I. Forever is a lie people tell to make mortality bearable. I believe in Tuesday. In this specific Tuesday where you exist and I exist and we exist in the same zip code. I believe in right now, which is all we ever have, which is enough, which is everything.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance or security or taxes. Marry me as an act of rebellion against the universe that made us temporary. Marry me because we're already so quantum entangled that separation would require rewriting physics. Marry me because I've already carved you into my hippocampus and the surgery to remove you would leave me unable to form new memories.\n\nMarry me because I was dead for thirteen seconds and I came back wrong\u2014I came back only able to love you.\n\n*\n\nOr don't marry me. Just keep existing near me. Keep mispronouncing words. Keep forgetting to close cabinets. Keep being the person who made me understand why ancient peoples invented gods\u2014because some things are too big for human vocabulary.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: This morning, you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that should have killed me.

She looked at me\u2014this stranger holding your routine\u2014and said: \"You're the one she smiles about.\" \n\nI cried in my car afterward. Forty minutes. Because you smile about me to strangers. Because somewhere, in conversations I'll never hear, you're choosing to make me real.\n\n*\n\nTruth: I've been writing your name on things. Nothing visible. The condensation on shower glass. Dust on windshields. Sand with my toe. Like a child learning letters, except I'm thirty-one and what I'm learning is that love makes you illiterate in your own life. Everything else becomes unreadable. Just you. You. You.\n\n*\n\n3 AM discoveries: Your breathing changes when you dream. Three distinct patterns. Pattern two is nightmares\u2014your fingers curl, seeking. I've learned to reach for your hand before you wake. Not to comfort you. To comfort me. To prove I can still protect you from things I can't see.\n\n*\n\nWe met 1,297 days ago. I've loved you for 1,298. That impossible math? The day before we met, I couldn't sleep. Kept checking my phone. Nothing wrong, just\u2014waiting. Like my body knew you were coming. Like every cell was holding its breath.\n\n*\n\nHere's what terrifies me: I'm not special. Average height, average face, I make average jokes. But you laugh anyway. Real laughter\u2014the kind that uses your whole body. How do I survive being loved by someone who could have anyone? I don't. I just wake up every day and pretend I deserve this until maybe someday I will.\n\n*\n\nYou said you wanted truth, not poetry. But you ARE my truth. The fact of you. That you exist, somewhere, breathing. Even when I can't see you. Even when you're angry. Even if you leave. You happened. You're happening. That's the only true thing I know anymore.\n\n*\n\nI bought the ring before I could afford it. Stupid. But the salesman asked \"when are you proposing?\" and I said \"when I'm brave enough\" and he said \"son, if you were brave you wouldn't be here.\" He was right. This isn't courage. It's surrender.\n\n*\n\nListen. I'm not going to promise you forever. Forever is too small for what this is. I'm going to promise you today. This today. Where your coffee is getting cold while you read this. Where I'm in the next room pretending to work but really just listening for you. Where we're both alive, both here, both choosing this.\n\nAnd tomorrow, if you'll have me, I'll promise you that today too.\n\n*\n\nThe question isn't \"will you marry me?\" We both know we're already married in every way that matters. Your books mixed with mine. My grandmother's recipe in your handwriting. That scar on my hand from assembling furniture for our place.\n\nThe question is: can I tell the world? Can I stand in front of everyone we know and say \"this is the person who taught me what skin is for\u2014to keep me separate enough from you that I can see you clearly, close enough that I can touch\"?\n\n*\n\nLeyi\u2014\n\nThat's the only word that matters now. Not love. Not marriage. Not future.\n\nJust: Leyi.\n\nThe word that reorganized my mouth. That made me need to speak just to say it again.\n\n*\n\nCome here. I'm in our bedroom with your grandmother's ring\u2014the one you thought we sold for the deposit. We didn't. I couldn't. Some things you don't sell, even for shelter. You keep them for moments like this, when shelter means nothing if you're not in it.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you like a broken bone that healed wrong. Constant ache, but functional. Stronger at the break point than before. Unable to remember what it felt like when I was whole, before I needed you to complete the architecture of me.\n\nSay yes. Not to the ring. To tomorrow morning, where we'll wake up and I'll make coffee wrong and you'll fix it and that will be our first married fight and it will be perfect because it will be ours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I lied. I turned the light on. I wanted to see the words. They look like what I feel\u2014inadequate but trying. Desperate but true. Small black marks attempting to hold something infinite. Like me, attempting to hold you.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"]}}}
