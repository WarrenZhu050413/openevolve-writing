My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes.

I found myself in the kitchen, holding your favorite mug, unable to remember why I was born. Then you coughed from the bedroom\u2014just once, barely anything\u2014and my entire skeleton remembered its purpose: to carry me to wherever you are coughing.\n\n*\n\nI need to confess something. Last Thursday, while you were at work, I had what the doctor called a \"panic event.\" What actually happened: I found your hair on my pillow and understood, suddenly, that someday I would find your hair on my pillow and you wouldn't exist anymore. I threw up. Then I saved the hair. It's in an envelope marked \"Thursday's proof.\"\n\nI have forty-three such envelopes.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I can't say out loud: Yesterday you got a paper cut and I wanted to burn down the paper factory. You bled for two seconds. I've been angry for nineteen hours. This morning I wrote a letter to the CEO of papermaking. I didn't send it. But I wrote it. Three pages about how his entire industry is built on the violence of edges.\n\nThis is what you've done to me. I'm writing letters to strangers about your blood.\n\n*\n\nThe stupidest thing: I've been training myself to love you less. Cognitive behavioral therapy. Exposure treatment. I stare at your photo until it means nothing. Except it never means nothing. It means everything, then more than everything, then something past everything that doesn't have a name because no one else has ever needed to name it.\n\nTwenty-seven sessions. $4,860. Complete failure.\n\nMoney well spent.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, our first fight. You threw a book. Missed me, hit the wall. I kept the dent. When you apologized, I said it was nothing. But I traced it with my finger every day for a year. The wall remembering your anger. Me, remembering you're capable of throwing things, of missing, of apologizing. Of being human while I'm here turning you into religion.\n\n*\n\nWant to know something medical? My resting heart rate has changed. Used to be 72. Now it's 67. But only when you're in the room. You literally make my heart more efficient. I had this tested. Three different doctors. One said, \"That's not how hearts work.\" I said, \"Then hearts are broken.\" He didn't understand I meant all hearts. All hearts that aren't mine. Mine works correctly now. Yours is its pacemaker.\n\n*\n\nI lied about the seventeen seconds. It was twenty-three. But twenty-three seconds of death seemed too specific, too much like fate. Like those extra six seconds were the universe making room for you. I came back different. Not better. Different. Like someone had reached into my source code and commented out everything except one function: love_leyi().\n\nEverything else is deprecated.\n\n*\n\nSo. Marriage. Here's what I'm actually asking: Be the person I look for first in every room. Keep being annoyed at how I load the dishwasher. Get old in front of me. Let me watch your hair turn gray and pretend I don't notice you dyeing it. Fight with me about thermostats. Develop prescriptions. Forget my birthday sometimes. Remember it others. Be human. Be here. Be mine while I'm yours.\n\nThat's all. That's everything. That's the only prayer I remember how to say.\n\n*\n\nThe ring is in the freezer. You hate cold fingers, so when you find it\u2014and you will, because you eat ice cream when stressed\u2014your first instinct will be to put it on just to warm it up. That's when you'll realize. That's when you'll know I've been planning this for 1,247 days. Since the first time you fell asleep on my shoulder on the bus and I missed our stop. Missed three stops. Would have missed the entire route but you woke up and said, \"Where are we?\" \n\nAnd I thought: Wherever you are. That's where we are.\n\n*\n\nRight now, you're touching your hair. You always do when you're about to cry. Your tell. My favorite tell. In three seconds, you'll look up from this letter and see me standing in the doorway where I've been watching you read. Waiting. Counting.\n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or don't. But know this: My atoms decided the moment yours walked into that coffee shop. Everything since has just been paperwork. Beautiful, necessary paperwork.

Because they were \"too dressed up for the occasion.\" That's when my atoms recognized their assignment.\n\n*\n\nI don't love you. Love is too small, too common. People love songs. They love weather. What I have needs a new word. Something that sounds like breaking and tastes like copper. Something between prayer and criminal confession.\n\n*\n\nYour left eye is crying.

You want to know what death is? Nothing. Not peace, not light. Just the universe hitting delete. But when they brought me back\u2014before I remembered my name, before I understood I had a body\u2014there was this weight. This debt. Three years later I met you. The debt was you. My atoms had made a promise before I existed.\n\n*\n\nYou asked for truth, not beauty. So here's ugly truth: I'm documenting us like evidence. \n\nTuesday, October 3rd, 11:47 PM: You fell asleep holding my wrist. Not my hand. My wrist. Like checking for pulse.\n\nWednesday, October 4th, 7:23 AM: You sang to the coffee maker. It was broken. You sang anyway.\n\nThursday, October 5th, 4:15 PM: You cried at a commercial about dogs. Left eye first. Always left eye first.\n\nI have 1,847 such entries. This isn't romantic. It's pathological. I'm building a backup of you for when the universe commits theft.\n\n*\n\nMore truth: You've ruined me for language. Yesterday I forgot the word \"door.\" Called it \"the room-hole.\" You laughed. That sound\u2014it reorganizes matter. Makes me believe in things I can't measure. I wanted to record it but phones can't capture what happens to oxygen when you're happy.\n\nI've calculated we have 23,360 breakfasts left if we're lucky. The number makes me violent. I want to sue mathematics. I want to break into wherever they keep time and steal more.\n\n*\n\nListen. Before you, I was symmetrical. Contained. Now I'm this lopsided thing that lists toward you even when you're absent. I've lost arguments with your ghost. I practice your death nightly\u2014car crashes, diseases with Latin names, sudden vanishing like quantum particles. I wake up, check your breathing. Still here. Still impossible. Still breaking physics by existing.\n\nBut also: I love you in our Tuesdays. In how you hold pencils wrong. In your rage at slow WiFi (magnificent rage\u2014holy rage). In the way you'll age, which I can already see in certain light. Those lines forming from squinting at screens. I want to trace them like maps of survived time.\n\n*\n\nYou know what love actually is? Not feeling. Accumulated decisions we can't reverse. Watch:\n\nDecision 1: That Tuesday you mispronounced my name. I thought: \"Oh. There she is. The person who'll ruin me.\"\n\nDecision 2: Keeping your voicemail from March 15th. You were furious about parking. I listen to it when you travel.\n\nDecision 3: Learning your grandmother's soup. Forty-seven steps. I cry every time. (The onions. Also not the onions.)\n\nDecision 4-1,847: [Filed under \"Evidence of Irreversibility\"]\n\n*\n\nHere's my worst confession: I'm not good. I'm selfish and frightened and I count your breaths seventeen times per night. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to sob about your temporariness. I've already named our hypothetical children. Even the ones we'll never have. I carry tissues everywhere because I know your crying patterns. Three years of tissues. That's not love. That's illness.\n\nExcept it's also love.\n\nBoth things. \n\nTrue things.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not because this letter moves you. Because your toothbrush already lives here. Because we've survived each other's worst Wednesdays. Because I've been yours since before I knew your name existed. Because in infinite parallel universes, this is the only one where we both exist simultaneously, aware of each other, with matching coffee preferences and the same favorite terrible TV show.\n\nMarry me because the alternative\u2014a timeline where I don't watch you argue with automated phone systems, where you don't steal my socks, where your leftover Chinese food doesn't mysteriously disappear at 2 AM\u2014isn't life. It's just time happening to someone else.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: I love you wrong. Too much. Like an amputee loves a phantom limb\u2014desperately, impossibly, with neurons that refuse to accept absence. The surgery to remove you from my brain would kill me. I mean this literally. I asked a neurosurgeon. He said \"that's not how brains work.\" I said \"then you don't understand the problem.\"\n\n*\n\nLeyi.\n\nThat's the only word that matters.\n\nLeyi.\n\nThe rest is just punctuation.\n\n*\n\nSay yes. Or say no. Just say something.\n\nThe silence is rearranging my organs.\n\nWarren\n(who has been saving Wednesday, March 15th, 2019, in his pocket for seven years, because that's the day he wrote \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body\" and the universe started building you)\n\nP.S. \u2014 Your left eye is watering.

My hands shake. Not metaphorically. Actually shake. Watch the letters tremble.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not beautiful. It's terrifying. It's me at the grocery store, paralyzed in the cereal aisle because I'm calculating how many breakfasts we have left if we're lucky. 23,360. I've counted. That's if we make it to eighty. I want to sue the universe for this number.\n\nYou want truth? I practice your death in my dreams. Every night. Different versions. Car accidents, diseases with Latin names, sudden disappearances where you simply vanish like a quantum particle nobody was observing. I wake up and check your breathing. Count: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three\u2014there. There you are. Still real. Still impossible.\n\nI loved you before I met you. This sounds insane. It is insane. But on March 15th, 2019, three years before we met, I wrote in my journal: \"There's someone out there who laughs with their whole body.\" That was you. You were already changing me before you existed in my life. How do you explain that to physics?\n\nListen. I'm bad at this. I'm the guy who once tried to say \"I love you\" and instead said \"your face is very...necessary.\" But here's what I know: every cell in my body gets replaced every seven years except neurons. The neurons keep the memories. Which means the part of me that remembers meeting you is the only part that will remain exactly the same until I die. Everything else about me will change except my memory of seeing you for the first time, when you were arguing with a parking meter like it had personally insulted your mother.\n\nI steal time. I admit this. When you're sleeping, I stay awake an extra hour just to exist in a world that contains you. I've stolen 1,247 hours this way. I'm not sorry.\n\nYou know what terrifies me most? That you'll say yes. That you'll actually marry me and then discover I'm just a collection of anxieties wearing a human suit. That I check if you're breathing seventeen times a night. That I've named our unborn children in my head\u2014even the ones we'll never have. That sometimes I love you so much I have to go sit in the bathroom and cry into a towel so you won't hear.\n\nBut you probably know all this. You know I save your voicemails in three different places in case civilization collapses. You know I learned to cook your grandmother's soup even though it has forty-seven steps and makes me cry (not from emotion, from onions, but also from emotion). You know that when you had the flu, I googled \"how to transfer illness from one person to another\" because I wanted to take it from you.\n\nHere's my proposal: Marry me. Not because I promise you forever\u2014forever is a lie we tell because the truth is unbearable. Marry me for the next twenty-four hours. Then let's renew it tomorrow. And the next day. Let's make a thousand small marriages, each one a choice, each one a revolution against the dying of light.\n\nMarry me because I'm selfish. Because I want the legal right to make medical decisions for you, to claim you on tax forms, to wear a ring that tells strangers I'm already taken by someone who hums Chopin while brushing their teeth.\n\nMarry me because last Tuesday, when you said \"we should get married someday,\" I went to the bathroom and threw up from happiness. Actual vomit. From joy. That's how broken and perfect you've made me.\n\nI don't have a ring. I have this letter and a heart that beats your name in Morse code. I have hands that know the exact temperature you like your coffee (167 degrees Fahrenheit). I have a mouth that's terrible at speeches but excellent at saying your name like it's the only prayer I remember.\n\nLeyi. That's it. That's the whole truth.\n\nLeyi.\n\nSay yes anyway.\n\nWarren\n(still shaking)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies\n\n### Inspiration 3 (Score: 0.6970, Type: Alternative)\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my non-dominant hand because my right one won't stop shaking. This is what you've done to my motor control.\n\nHere's the truth without ornament: I've been conscious for 11,687 days. 11,471 of them were rehearsal. The rest\u2014the only ones that count\u2014started with you mispronouncing my coffee order and me thinking: oh god, I'm going to love this person until my bones forget their purpose.\n\n*\n\nTuesday, 2:47 PM. You're reading this now. I know because I've been standing outside for twenty minutes, watching our kitchen window. I saw you pick up the envelope. Your shoulders did that thing\u2014that micro-adjustment that means you're about to cry or fight. I'm hoping for both. I'm hoping for everything.\n\n*\n\nI need to tell you about the silence. Not metaphorical silence. Actual silence. Last month, when you had that conference in Portland. Day three, 9 PM, I temporarily went deaf. No medical reason. My brain just stopped processing sound because what was the point? You weren't there to make any.\n\nThe doctors called it \"psychosomatic hearing loss.\" I called it love. Both diagnoses are terminal.\n\n*\n\nYou wanted honesty? I've been stealing from you. Small thefts. The hair from your brush (I keep it in my wallet). Voice recordings of you arguing with customer service (seventeen files, chronologically ordered). That half-second between sleep and waking when you reach for me\u2014I've stolen hundreds of those, hoarded them like evidence that I exist.\n\nI am building an archive of you because I don't trust the universe to remember you correctly when you're gone.\n\n*\n\nHere's what I know: We have 2.7 billion heartbeats each, on average. You've already used 981 million. I've done the math\u2014if we synchronize perfectly, we have 1.7 billion beats together. Maximum. That number keeps me awake. Not because it's small. Because it's specific. Because I can feel them spending themselves right now\u2014thump, thump, thump\u2014like coins falling through my fingers.\n\n*\n\nBut listen. This is important. Yesterday you hummed while peeling an orange. Just hummed. No melody. And I thought: this is prayer. Not the words we say skyward but this\u2014you, unconscious of your holiness, committing the sacred act of continuing to exist near me.\n\nI don't believe in God. I believe in that humming.\n\n*\n\nThe truth about love? It's not poetry. It's this: I've memorized your parents' phone numbers in case you ever go missing. I keep your favorite tea in six different locations. I practice CPR monthly, specifically on a mannequin I've adjusted to your height and weight. I love you like preparing for disaster. Like disaster has already happened and I'm living in the after, grateful for whatever aftermath includes you.\n\n*\n\n4:52 AM, the night we met. You said, \"I don't believe in forever.\" Good. Neither do I. Forever is a lie people tell to make mortality bearable. I believe in Tuesday. In this specific Tuesday where you exist and I exist and we exist in the same zip code. I believe in right now, which is all we ever have, which is enough, which is everything.\n\n*\n\nSo here's my proposal: Marry me. Not for romance or security or taxes. Marry me as an act of rebellion against the universe that made us temporary. Marry me because we're already so quantum entangled that separation would require rewriting physics. Marry me because I've already carved you into my hippocampus and the surgery to remove you would leave me unable to form new memories.\n\nMarry me because I was dead for thirteen seconds and I came back wrong\u2014I came back only able to love you.\n\n*\n\nOr don't marry me. Just keep existing near me. Keep mispronouncing words. Keep forgetting to close cabinets. Keep being the person who made me understand why ancient peoples invented gods\u2014because some things are too big for human vocabulary.\n\n*\n\nFinal truth: This morning, you said \"when we're old\" and my heart did something that should have killed me. It didn't. That's how I know we're supposed to do this. My body is rewriting its own survival priorities. You've become more necessary than rhythm.\n\nWarren\n(whose atoms have already married yours without permission)\n\n*\n\nP.S. You're crying now. I can see you through the window. Your left eye, as always. In seven seconds, you'll touch your face with your sleeve instead of getting a tissue because you're stubborn about the strangest things. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two.\n\nThere.\n\nCome outside. I'm the idiot in the rain holding the ring I've carried for 842 days. Yes, I counted. I count everything now. It's the only way I can prove this is real\u2014that you happened to me, that we happened to each other, that against every statistical probability, we got to exist simultaneously.\n\nSay yes. Or just nod. Or just exist in my direction.\n\nThat's all I've ever needed.\nThat's everything.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```\nUnique approach: Modification: Full rewrite, Mixed iteration strategies, Comprehensive implementation\n\n# Current Program\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI am writing this at 3:47 AM because sleep has become a foreign country since you asked for truth. My hands shake\u2014not from fear, but from the impossibility of translating what happens to my molecular structure when you exist in the same room.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you about love: it's not the symphony everyone promises. It's the way you mispronounce \"specifically\" when you're excited, that little 'pacific' that somehow contains entire oceans. It's how you eat ice cream in winter because \"temperature is just a social construct,\" then steal my jacket anyway. It's the seventeen seconds every morning between when I wake and when I remember you're real, and how those seventeen seconds of forgetting make the remembering feel like winning the universe on repeat.\n\nI've been keeping inventory. Your laugh has forty-three distinct variations\u2014I've catalogued them all. The quiet library giggle. The sudden bark when I say something unexpectedly absurd. That rolling thunder when joy completely overtakes you. Number thirty-seven is my favorite: the silent shoulder-shake when you're trying not to wake me, not knowing I'm already awake, memorizing the rhythm of your happiness.\n\nYou wanted honesty? I practice conversations with you in the shower. I've written this letter 200 times in my head, deleted 199 for containing the word \"soul.\" I'm terrified that I love you more than you love me, and equally terrified of the opposite. When you had the flu last March, I googled \"can you die from someone else's fever\" because your suffering felt like mine but worse\u2014mine I could bear, yours rewired my understanding of unbearable.\n\nBut here's the thing about truth\u2014it's smaller than we think. It's not \"I would die for you\" (though I would). It's \"I'll kill the spiders even though I'm also afraid.\" It's not \"you complete me.\" It's \"before you, I never noticed I was incomplete.\" It's this: when I imagine different futures, you're the only constant that doesn't feel like a limitation but like the opposite\u2014like suddenly having infinite variables because with you, even the ordinary becomes unprecedented.\n\nI could tell you about the Sunday you cried at the ending of that ridiculous movie about penguins, how your empathy for animated birds made me want to be worthy of living on the same planet. I could map the constellation of freckles on your left shoulder (Orion's belt, but better). I could confess that I've already planned our arguments twenty years from now, and how even in imagination, your angry face makes me want to kiss you until we forget what we were fighting about.\n\nInstead, I'll tell you this: I love you like a fact, not a feeling. Like gravity, or the speed of light\u2014something fundamental that doesn't require belief to be true. I love you at the quantum level, where observation changes everything and nothing simultaneously. I love you past the heat death of the universe, which sounds like hyperbole but feels like underselling it.\n\nMarry me. Not because this letter moves you, but because you already know that tomorrow without you is just time, not a future. Marry me because we've already started forever; I'm just asking for the paperwork. Marry me because when I say your name, even in my head, my mouth makes the shape of home.\n\nYours in this universe and whatever comes after,\nWarren\n\nP.S. \u2013 If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to learn interpretive dance.
