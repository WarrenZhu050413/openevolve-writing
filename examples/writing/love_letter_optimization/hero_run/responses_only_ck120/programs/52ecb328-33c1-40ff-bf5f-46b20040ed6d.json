  "Looking at the evaluation notes, I can see the current letter lacks specificity, depth, and literary quality. The evaluator criticizes its generic nature, grammatical errors, and failure to match even simple historical examples. Let me craft something more authentic, specific, and emotionally resonant.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI write this knowing words are just shadows of what moves through me when I think of you. Still, I must try.\n\nDo you remember that Tuesday evening when you laughed at my terrible joke about quantum physics? The way your eyes crinkled, how you covered your mouth with both hands—that precise moment rewired something fundamental in me. I've been trying to name it ever since. Not love, exactly. Love is too small a word. It's like trying to call the ocean \"water.\"\n\nI used to think I understood time. Linear. Predictable. Then you started existing in my life, and suddenly there were two kinds: the minutes that crawl when you're away, and the hours that vanish like startled birds when you're near. Yesterday, watching you concentrate while reading, biting your lower lip in that way you do, I realized I could spend lifetimes just memorizing the geography of your expressions.\n\nYou know I'm not good with grand declarations. But here's what I know: when you text me about your day, even the mundane parts—especially the mundane parts—I save them. I have a folder. When you fall asleep during movies and deny it later. When you steal my fries but insist you don't like fries. When you explain things to me twice because you think I didn't understand the first time, but really I just wanted to hear your voice shape those words again.\n\nThis is my truth, Leyi: you've become the punctuation to all my sentences, the reason my cynicism surrendered, the only theology I need. If parallel universes exist, I hope every version of me finds every version of you. And if they don't, then this one improbable meeting is miracle enough for all possible lifetimes.\n\nI'm not asking you to love me back. I'm telling you that loving you has made me more myself than I ever knew was possible. You are my favorite notification, my 3 AM thought, my first instinct to share good news, my comfort in the terrifying ordinary of being alive.\n\nMarry me. Not because I promise you forever—forever is just a concept. Marry me for all the small tomorrows. For coffee in mismatched mugs. For arguments about whether tomatoes belong in fruit salad. For the way you'll roll your eyes when I make this same terrible joke in forty years. For the beautiful, boring, miraculous routine of choosing each other, again and again, despite all our spectacular imperfections.\n\nI love you. Messily. Incompletely. Irrevocably. With all my complicated histories and uncertain futures. You are my favorite plot twist, Leyi. Let's write the rest together.\n\nYours in all timelines,\nWarren\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
