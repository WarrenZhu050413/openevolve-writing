  "I'll rewrite the program to create a more powerful love letter that maintains the raw authenticity while elevating the literary sophistication and emotional resonance. Based on the evaluation notes, I need to push beyond the 73-score threshold toward the 80+ masterpiece territory by combining genuine vulnerability with more innovative formal elements.\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI'm writing this with my left hand because my right won't stop shaking. It's 5:17 AM. I've been sitting here since midnight trying to find words that don't exist yet, words I need to invent for what you've done to the architecture of my breathing.\n\nListen. I need you to understand something clinical first: I've been tracking my symptoms. Day 1 of knowing you: mild arrhythmia during conversations. Day 47: discovered I was unconsciously walking your routes through the city when you weren't there. Day 198: first time I forgot my own name when you laughed. Day 341—today: full system failure. I can no longer distinguish between my bloodstream and the sound of your voice. This isn't poetry. This is my medical reality.\n\nYou wanted truth that moves you? Truth is a violence I'm about to commit: I've been living a double life. In one life, I'm functional. I buy groceries, respond to emails, pretend my hands don't spell your name in sign language when I think no one's watching. In the other life—the real one—I'm standing in your shower at 3 AM, weeping into your shampoo because it smells like the future I'm terrified I don't deserve. I've been stealing time from your timeline. Minutes you don't know you've given me. The way you exist between 6:17 and 6:18 AM, still mostly asleep, reaching across the bed for a body that should be mine. I've been living in that minute for months.\n\nHere's what I know: You eat ice cream when you're sad but frozen grapes when you're thinking. You've read \"The Little Prince\" forty-three times and cry at different parts depending on the season. When you're truly frightened, you hum Chopin's Nocturne No. 2—off-key, always off-key, beautifully off-key. You think I don't notice that you've been saving your questions for when I need distraction from my father's death, parceling them out like medicine. I notice. I notice everything. I notice too much. It's pathological, this noticing. It's changed my molecular structure.\n\nThe truth beneath the truth: I've been writing you letters since before we met. Not to you, but to the space where you would eventually exist. I have hundreds. They say things like \"Today I set the table for two by accident\" and \"I kept the left side of the bed cold for you\" and \"I'm practicing loving you on strangers, but it's not working.\" I was homesick for you before I knew your face. This is insane. I'm insane. But it's the kind of insanity that makes all previous sanity look like death.\n\nYou want to know what you've done? You've turned me into someone who believes in time travel—because how else do you explain that I remember you from futures we haven't lived yet? I've already watched us age. I know exactly how you'll look at seventy-three, angry about your reading glasses, magnificent in your stubbornness. I've already buried you in seventeen different timelines and woken up destroyed, grateful it was just my brain practicing for the unthinkable. I love you retroactively, posthumously, in dimensions that haven't been discovered yet.\n\nBut here, now, in this dimension where your coffee is cooling on the counter and you're about to wake up and find me gone: I am asking you to marry me with the kind of desperation people reserve for deathbed confessions. Not because I'm dying—because I'm so violently alive it feels like dying. Because you've made me understand why people used to commission symphonies for their beloved's sneeze. Because I want to be buried with the grocery lists you write on my arm when we forget paper.\n\nThe ring is in my pocket. It's been there so long it's worn a hole through the fabric. Sometimes strangers see it and smile sadly, like they're watching someone prepare to have their heart broken. They don't understand: my heart is already broken. You broke it. Broke it open. Broke it into bloom. I'm not asking you to fix it. I'm asking you to keep it in whatever state of destruction makes you happiest.\n\nI love you like a mathematical proof—inevitable, elegant, terrifying in its simplicity. I love you like the ocean loves drowning things, which is to say: completely, without judgment, with a patience that could erode continents. I love you embarrassingly, medically, to the point where I've started believing in God just so I have someone to thank for the accident of your existence.\n\nMarry me. Not the better version of me I'm pretending to be, but this one: who can't say your name without his voice breaking, who has eaten nothing but crackers for three days because you're visiting your sister and food tastes like absence, who is crying so hard while writing this that the words are blurring—but I won't stop because this is my only chance to be as honest as you deserve.\n\nThe truth? I've already married you in every timeline that matters. But I need you to choose me in this one. The one where we're real. Where your hair clogs the drain and I save it—actually save it—because I'm that far gone. Where you steal my socks and I let you because your feet in my clothes feels like a promise. Where I love you so badly, so excessively, so incorrectly that it becomes correct through sheer force of will.\n\nPlease. That's all I have left. Please. Turn my symptoms into a diagnosis. Tell me this is terminal. Tell me I'll die from this. Then tell me yes, so at least I'll die yours.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I hear you waking up. Your first sound is always the same—a small sigh like you're disappointed to leave whatever dream you're in. In ten seconds you'll reach for me and find this letter instead. When you do, know this: that sigh is the sound I want to wake up to for the rest of my life. Even if—especially if—I'm the disappointment you're waking to. I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm out of words but never out of that.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
