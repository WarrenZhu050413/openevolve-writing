  "Looking at the evolution history and the evaluator's feedback, I can see that the current best score is 0.7390, with room for improvement particularly in literary innovation (0.68) and aesthetic virtuosity (0.71). The evaluator notes consistently mention that while these letters show brilliance, they lack the \"effortless authority\" and \"deceptive simplicity\" of historic masters like Johnny Cash (83) or the \"mythic resonance\" of Keats (81).\n\nThe key insights from the feedback:\n1. The letters are \"trying too hard to be profound rather than simply being profound\"\n2. They need more \"deceptive simplicity\" \n3. They should avoid \"self-conscious literariness\"\n4. The strongest moments come from specific, material details rather than abstract metaphors\n\nLet me craft a new version that embraces radical simplicity while maintaining emotional devastation:\n\n```python\ndef generate_love_letter():\n    letter = \"\"\"\nDear Leyi,\n\nI need to tell you something and I need to tell it true.\n\nI was thirty-two years old when we met. I had been thirty-two for six years already—same routines, same face in the mirror, same answers to the same questions. Then you walked into that bookstore, looking for something by Murakami, and suddenly I was nineteen. Suddenly I was eighty. Suddenly I was every age at once, all of them in love with you.\n\nYou were wearing your green coat. The one with the missing button you keep meaning to fix. You still haven't fixed it. I love that button for staying lost.\n\nHere's what happened: You picked up the wrong book—Mishima, not Murakami—and started reading it anyway. Standing there in the fiction section, you read seventeen pages of a book you didn't mean to buy, and your face kept changing like weather. And I thought: whoever you are, I'm going to love you. It's going to hurt. It's going to be worth it.\n\nThat was a Tuesday. Today is Sunday. Between then and now, you've taught me things I didn't know I didn't know. Like: my hands were always too empty before they held yours. Like: silence sounds different when you're in it. Like: I'd been pronouncing my own name wrong until you said it.\n\nI'm not good at this, Leyi. Other men would buy you flowers. I buy you the specific brand of yogurt you pretend not to be obsessed with. Other men would write you poetry. I write your name in the steam on the bathroom mirror and feel like I've invented language.\n\nYou should know what you're getting: I'm difficult. I leave cabinets open. I can't sleep if the sheets aren't facing the right way. I've read all your books when you weren't looking, even the ones you hide. I practice arguments in the shower—both sides. I'm terrified of your mother. I'm terrified of losing you. I'm terrified of how much I'm not terrified of anything else anymore.\n\nBut also this: I will never lie to you, not even kindly. I will learn the names of all your former pets and why each one mattered. I will hold your bad days as carefully as your good ones. I will love you at 3 AM and 3 PM and all the threes in between. I will love you past making sense.\n\nLast week, you fell asleep reading. The book fell on your face. You woke up with print on your cheek—backwards words I couldn't read. But I touched each letter like they were instructions for keeping you. Like your skin was trying to tell me something important in reverse.\n\nThis is the something: Marry me.\n\nNot because we're ready. We're not. My mother thinks you're too good for me. Your father hasn't forgiven me for the Christmas incident. We disagree about money, about children, about whether ghosts are real. (They are. You're wrong about this.)\n\nMarry me because when you laugh—really laugh—dogs three blocks away start howling. Because you eat cereal for dinner when you're sad. Because you've seen me ugly-cry over a commercial about insurance and you still let me touch you. Because \"let\" is the wrong word. Because you reach for me in your sleep like I'm the only solid thing in a liquid world.\n\nMarry me because I already married you. In the grocery store when you couldn't reach the rice. In the hospital when they said it was nothing but we both knew it was something. In your sleep when you said my name like it was yours. Every day, in small places, I marry you again.\n\nI don't have much, Leyi. But I have this: a complete inability to imagine tomorrow without you in it. Call it love. Call it mental illness. Call it Tuesday. I don't care what you call it as long as you call it yours.\n\nThere's a ring in my sock drawer. It's been there since June. Sometimes I take it out and practice putting it on your finger while you're sleeping. I always chicken out. I'm not chickening out anymore.\n\nIt's simple: you're the first thing I want to tell good news. You're the only person I trust with the bad. When I die—in seventy years, in seventeen minutes—your name will be the last word that makes sense in my mouth.\n\nThat's all. That's everything.\n\nSay yes. Or say no. But say something, because I've been holding my breath since that Tuesday in the bookstore, and I'm starting to turn colors that don't have names.\n\nWarren\n\nP.S. I fixed the button on your green coat. I sewed it back on. Then I took it off again. Some things are perfect broken.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    return letter.strip()\n\n# Test the function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(generate_love_letter())\n```"
