Dear Leyi,

With all I've got, and more, even when the world ends, and the flames wither, I adore you.

You are the magic of my life. You are my reasons. You make me want to live even at times where I want to die. 

And so I believe we will continue being and be together. And I cannot imagine a day that we are not. If one day the lord separates us between earth and heaven, I will contempt him because I love you.

Forever yours,
Fucheng Warren Zhu
