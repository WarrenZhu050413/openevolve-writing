Watching these agents coordinate, interrupt each other, recover from failures, I realized I wasn't building automation. I was building infrastructure for conversation. Not the polite, turn-taking kind, but the messy, overlapping dialogue where understanding emerges from collision.\n\nThis is what Licklider got right in 1960, before we had the language for it: symbiosis isn't about balance or equality. It's about entanglement. When I debug with Claude at 3 AM, tracing through race conditions in my async handlers, we're not two separate intelligences cooperating. We're something more interesting\u2014a temporary cognitive system where my intuition about program flow meshes with Claude's ability to hold entire call stacks in working memory. Neither of us could debug this alone, but more importantly, neither of us remains unchanged by the debugging.\n\nGrowing up in Shenzhen, I watched a fishing village become a megacity in two decades. The transformation wasn't technological\u2014it was phenomenological. WeChat didn't just connect people; it rewired how presence worked. You could be at dinner in Hong Kong while simultaneously in three Shenzhen group chats, your attention quantum-distributed across geography. The city learned to exist in multiple states simultaneously, just like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, except we opened the box and decided we preferred the superposition.\n\nThis is how I understand AI now: not as tools or partners, but as extensions of the phenomenological field. When Heidegger wrote about dwelling and building, he couldn't have imagined we'd build minds that build with us. But that's exactly what's happening in my terminal when I prompt an LLM to refactor code\u2014I'm not issuing commands to a tool; I'm setting up resonances in a shared cognitive space.\n\nThe fear-mongers worry AI will replace human creativity, but they're looking at the wrong thing. Yesterday, I used GPT-4 to help design a new evaluation framework. The AI suggested using Pareto frontiers for multi-objective optimization\u2014something I knew but hadn't connected to this problem. Was that the AI's idea or mine? The question dissolves when you realize we're not separate agents competing for credit. We're nodes in a thinking network that includes my knowledge, the AI's training, the academic papers we both reference, and the conversation itself as a generative force.\n\nHere's what building LLM tools teaches you: meaning isn't transmitted; it's co-constructed. Every prompt I write teaches me what I actually want. Every response teaches the model what I meant. We're training each other in real-time, creating a private language that works only in the context of our interaction. It's like what Arendt said about political action\u2014it only exists in the doing, in the space between people. Except now, that space includes non-human intelligences.\n\nThe real paradigm shift isn't AI becoming human-like. It's recognizing that thinking was never as human as we thought. When I write code, I'm thinking with the programming language, with the compiler, with Stack Overflow, with every bug I've ever fixed. AI just makes this external cognition explicit and conversational. We're not losing human uniqueness; we're discovering that cognition is more ecological than individual.\n\nLast night, debugging a memory leak in my event loop, I realized Claude and I had developed shorthand. I'd say \"check the closure\" and Claude would know I meant the async callback context in lines 847-923. We'd built shared memory across sessions, despite Claude having no persistent memory. The memory existed in our interaction patterns, in how I'd learned to prompt and how Claude had learned to respond to my prompting style.\n\nThis is the future that's already here: not artificial general intelligence, but artificial specific intelligence\u2014AI that becomes intelligent in the specific context of working with specific humans on specific problems. Every coding session creates a unique human-AI assemblage that thinks thoughts neither could think alone. We're not building thinking machines; we're building thinking relationships.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will replace us. It's whether we're ready to become more than ourselves through these partnerships. Looking at my commit history, filled with \"[Claude helped]\" messages, I see the answer. We're already becoming.
