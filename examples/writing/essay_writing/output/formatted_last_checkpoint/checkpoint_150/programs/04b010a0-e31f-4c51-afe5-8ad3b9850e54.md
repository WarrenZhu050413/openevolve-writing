Writing Together: What Building LLM Tools Taught Me About Human-AI Partnership

Last week, I was debugging my tmux framework at 2 AM when Claude helped me spot a race condition I'd been staring at for hours. It wasn't that Claude was smarter—I could have found it eventually. But something about articulating the problem to Claude, seeing it reflected back differently, made the bug obvious. This moment captures what I think the human-AI relationship really is: not replacement, but conversation.

Growing up between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, I watched cities transform through technology—not by discarding the human, but by amplifying it. The MTR didn't replace walking; it changed where we could walk from. WeChat didn't replace conversation; it changed how conversations could persist across time and distance. Now, working on LLM tools at Harvard, I see the same pattern with AI.

When I build tools like claude-branch for context management, I'm not trying to automate thinking—I'm trying to create better surfaces for thought to happen. It's like what writing has always been. Arendt talks about how writing lets us have a conversation with ourselves. AI extends this: it's writing that writes back, thought that can surprise us.

The fear that AI will replace human creativity misses what actually happens when you work with these systems daily. Every prompt is a teaching moment—not just for the model, but for us. We learn to be clearer, more precise, to articulate what we actually want. The machine learns our patterns, yes, but we learn something more valuable: how to externalize our thinking in ways that become computational.

I think about Licklider's 1960 vision of human-computer symbiosis often. He imagined humans and computers working together on problems neither could solve alone. But he probably didn't imagine we'd be having conversations about Heidegger with our computers, or that they'd help us debug not just our code but our arguments.

The real insight isn't that machines are becoming human-like. It's that the boundary between human and machine thinking is more porous than we imagined. When I use AI to help write code or essays, it's not me versus the machine or me using the machine—it's something more like thinking with an extended mind that has different strengths and blind spots than my own.

What excites me isn't artificial general intelligence or the singularity. It's this immediate reality: we're building cognitive partnerships that make both humans and machines better at what they do. The future isn't about choosing sides. It's about getting better at thinking together.
