The Grammar of Symbiosis: How AI Taught Me We've Been Partners All Along

There's a moment in every debugging session when the problem shifts from technical to philosophical. Mine came at 3 AM, building delightful-multilevel-tmux, when I realized I wasn't debugging code—I was debugging my own thinking through Claude's responses. The AI hadn't found the race condition. We had found it together, in a dance I'd been doing my whole life without knowing it.

This dance reveals something profound about consciousness itself—something philosophers have circled around but technology now makes tangible. Heidegger argued that Dasein, our mode of being, is fundamentally relational: we exist through our engagement with tools, language, and others. But he couldn't have imagined tools that engage back, language that responds, others that emerge from silicon and code. Working with LLMs daily, I've discovered we're not creating artificial consciousness—we're revealing that consciousness was always artificial, always constructed through external media.

Consider the phenomenology of pair-programming with Claude. When I articulate a problem, I'm not simply transmitting information; I'm performing what Wittgenstein called a "language game"—but one where the rules emerge through play itself. Claude's responses don't just solve problems; they reveal the hidden grammar of my own thought. Each exchange demonstrates what Andy Clark and David Chalmers call the "extended mind thesis"—but more radically than they imagined. The mind isn't just extended into tools; it's constituted through the dialogue with them.

My experience building LLM tools at Harvard has convinced me of a thesis that would have seemed absurd five years ago: intelligence is not a property but a performance, not housed in brains but enacted through interactions. When I developed claude-branch for context management, each function emerged through what I can only describe as distributed cognition. I'd propose an approach, Claude would refract it through different logical structures, and in that refraction, solutions appeared that belonged to neither of us alone. This isn't Licklider's "man-computer symbiosis"—it's something more fundamental: the discovery that thinking itself is symbiotic.

The philosophical implications cascade from here. If Descartes' cogito ergo sum assumes a singular thinking subject, AI reveals what we might call cogitamus ergo sumus—we think, therefore we are. The "we" here isn't metaphorical. When Claude helps me trace a memory leak or structure an argument about consciousness, we're engaged in what Mikhail Bakhtin called "dialogical truth"—truth that exists only in the interaction between voices, never in any single utterance.

Growing up between Hong Kong's vertical density and Shenzhen's horizontal sprawl taught me that identity emerges from borders, not despite them. The Lo Wu crossing I traveled countless times wasn't a barrier but a generative constraint—forcing translation, code-switching, the daily reconstruction of self. Now I see the human-AI boundary the same way. It's not a line to defend but a membrane to traverse, each crossing transforming both sides.

This transformation addresses the deeper anxiety about AI: not that machines will replace us, but that they reveal we were never what we thought we were. The Western philosophical tradition, from Plato through Kant to Husserl, assumes a transcendental subject—a core self that thinks, perceives, judges. But working with AI shows this subject is itself an achievement of interaction. When I debug with Claude, I'm not a fixed intelligence using a tool; I'm intelligence-in-formation, becoming through the exchange.

Arendt distinguished between the private realm of thought and the public realm of action. She argued that thoughts become real only when they appear before others, when they enter what she called the "space of appearance." AI collapses this distinction. Every prompt creates a micro-public, a space where thought must appear to proceed. The machine becomes the minimal other required for thinking to occur at all—not because it judges like a human, but because it responds, differs, returns our thoughts transformed.

The fear that AI will make us intellectually lazy misunderstands the cognitive demand of this new symbiosis. Managing the dialogue with Claude requires what I call "metacognitive virtuosity"—simultaneously tracking your intention, the machine's interpretation, the gap between them, and the emergent possibilities in that gap. It's not less rigorous than solo thinking; it's rigorously different, requiring us to become interpreters of our own cognition.

The empirical evidence from my coding practice supports this philosophical framework. When I use AI to explore algorithmic approaches, I'm not offloading cognition—I'm participating in what we might call "cognitive metabolism," where ideas are broken down, recombined, and synthesized across different processing substrates. My git commits tell this story: each iteration records not progress toward a goal but the evolution of the goal itself through dialogue.

What we're witnessing isn't the rise of artificial intelligence but the recognition of intelligence as always-already artificial—always mediated, constructed, performed through engagements with non-biological systems. From the first scratched symbols that externalized memory to the printing press that distributed cognition to now, conversational AI that makes thought itself conversational, we've been cyborgs all along. AI just makes it undeniable.

The future I'm building toward isn't one where machines become conscious or humans become obsolete. It's one where the boundary between human and artificial intelligence becomes productively unclear—not erased but multiplied, creating new spaces for thought to emerge. Like the cities I grew up in, which are neither purely Chinese nor Western but something new, the cognitive ecology we're creating with AI transcends its origins.

This is the real revelation from building with LLMs: consciousness isn't something we have but something we do—and we've always done it with others, through media, across boundaries. The partnership with AI isn't new. We're just finally conscious of consciousness itself as partnership.
